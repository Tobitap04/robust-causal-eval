2qaf8e,"Why do asians have slanted eyes? I looked it up but it seemed like the answers changed every time, so maybe I can get some solid/ just a bit changing answers here.
Also, I'm NOT trying to be racist. I'm honestly curious on the subject and am familiar that Asia is a huge continent with different peoples, but the majority of Asia most likely has the ""slanted"" eyes, at least in the Far east and indochina, and some turkic countries, it seems like they have a bit slanted.
So why is this?","The epicanthic fold is a bit of skin on the inner part of the upper eyelid that folds over and covers a bit of that part of the eye. Because it covers a bit of the upper portion of the eye there, it makes the eye look more ""slanted"".

It has developed in different populations at different times. Central, east, and southeast Asians, as you know, often have this. Also, indigenous Americans, Saan people (some indigenous Australians), Inuits, Berbers, and others. The best guess is that it's from environmental factors (protection from wind, or extra temperature protection), but it's tough to know for sure.",eli5

a1cmuc,Why do some car companies offer AWD but only when paired to an automatic transmission? I find this irritating. I am immediately thinking of Mazda. They just uncovered the new 3 which will have AWD but only in automatics. Same goes with the current CX 3. Is there a mechanical or economical reason behind this?,"Possibly one or the other or both. Economically, the two transmissions might have different lengths, so you would have to have more parts on hand to either have driveshafts of more different lengths if the center transfer device is moved, or provide some sort of extension off the tail of one of the transmissions to mate to the device if it is always going to be in the same location.

It may also be part of their ideal of how the system should operate. AWDs are becoming increasingly common, but also more complex, as their big selling point is safety. And being that safety is the goal, they may design more things into the specifics of how the powertrain behaves when presented with particular scenarios. Automatic transmissions are generally electronically controlled these days, and can be used in conjunction with the AWD and ABS brakes and things like electronic throttle to ideally always provide the best traction and control that it can. With a manual, it's stuck with whatever gear you have chosen and is probably waiting for you to push the clutch if it needs to remove power from the source as part of that. It has much more control over the overall stability of the vehicle if it has control over its transmission.

It may also be that their particular AWD setup can handle the power at the tailshaft from an automatic but not a manual. Manuals are much more efficient than automatics typically, which means since there are less friction losses there's potentially more torque at the tailshaft. Finally it may just be some sort of requirement of their design to have the fluid coupling of an automatic rather than the solid one of a manual for some reason.

Perhaps you could write to them? Slim chances but maybe they could explain the philosophy of this design decision to you, as long as you approach with genuine curiosity and keep the gripe to a minimum.",eli5

Demand of the bonds may increase, if the the government set them at a price that would increase their demand, which it probably will since it wants people to buy its bonds and curtail money supply. 

(2) Stocks and bonds are competitive goods, like Nike and Reebok, as opposed to complimentary goods like peanut butter and jelly. When people buy more stocks, they buy less bonds -- when people buy more Nike sneakers, they buy less Reebok sneakers. So if there is speculation in the market that stock prices are about to rise, people will buy stocks now instead of bonds now. (It's actually a self-fulfilling prophecy since all those people buying stocks raised the price of stocks.) So, the demand for bonds decreases, or on a graph that means shifts left. 

Hope this helps you.

Why does my vision gets worse  &  worse? I'll turn 19 in 2 days.,"* ""Bear sight person"" I know, just a typo. Still funny.
* 0.25 is not that much of a difference, most people with near- or long-sightedness have slightly different diopters between their eyes.
* Your vision still gets worse because your body, namely the facial structure of bones and muscles, still changes. For some people those changes alter the pressure in and around the eyes, slightly changing the shape of the eyeball, shifting the lenses and causing them to lose focus.

Since muscles and bones don't just randomly switch direction and grow the opposite way you'll probably notice a slow decline in vision until you're around 22-25 and your body is finally done with all that puberty. Of course, faces still grow and change after that but much more slowly.",,eli5

Maybe someone knows something about this :)
Thank you in advance!

Edit:
Or is this even the case that those animals would like it or just coincidence? ","I'm not a biologist, but I've wondered about this for a while too. I wonder if we're looking at it backwards; rather than thinking about why animals like scratches, the question might better be why humans are such good scratchers. Looking at how dogs and cats scratch themselves or interact with small objects, they're comparatively really clumsy compared to humans. Even watching gorillas and orangutans on fine motor control tasks, they are really bad compared to humans. To do something like scratch an itch or massage a muscle, most animals have to do it in a really rough way, such as how dogs kick their ears, bite at fleas, or roll on their back. Imagine if that were the only way you could scratch itches; wouldn't you only do it if the itch was really unbearable? Now reverse it for animals. Imagine you met a creature that could help you with itches and aches in a really gentle and precise way. It'd be like getting rid of constant minor discomforts, which seems like it would feel great. For animals like fish, they have the hardest time doing the simplest tasks, like cleaning themselves or getting parasites off their bodies. They often use the help of other more precise creatures to do that for them, usually much smaller ones. It might be similar for other animals with humans. I'd guess that excellent human dexterity is the real answer to this question.",eli5

25o1ni,"Why is common carrier status better than internet ""fast lanes"" for consumers? ","A common carrier is an entity that delivers ""goods"" to the public in general.  For examples, the goods that phone companies deliver is a connection to the telephone system so that you can call anyone with a phone and phone service.  Phone companies are categorized as a common carrier because the service they provide to the public is determined to be an essential utility.

Comparing common carrier status and ""fast lanes"" is a bit misleading.  To use an analogy, replace Internet connections with roads.  Right now, the local roads you drive on or public and are maintained locally.  Suppose that the local government turns over control of the roads to a private company.  Should the government regulate the private company?  Should the government be able to step in and tell the private company that they need to build the roads so that every house has access to a road?  Should the government be able to tell the private company that they can't tell drivers they can only drive to certain destinations unless someone pays them extra?  Can the government force the company not to limit the amount people can drive on the roads?

I don't know what you think of these questions, but that's the debate that's happening right now.  Netflix (the destination), is being charged extra by Comcast (the road builder), to so that subscribers of Netflix can get reliable access (drive to Netflix) even though the subscribers have already paid for their internet connection (or in the analogy, they've already paid their monthly fee to drive on the road).

The idea of a ""fast lane"" is a marketing ploy by the ISPs to fool you into thinking that they're giving you something extra.  In truth, you've already paid for your Internet connection.  You're paying every month to get a reliable service up to a certain speed.  What the ISPs, like Comcast and Verizon, are claiming is that somehow you're using the service you already paid for too much, so they deserve more money.

Edit: Sorry I got into a bit of a rant at the end, but the point is that ISPs should be labeled as a common carrier if an Internet connection is deemed to be a essential utility.

""Fast lanes"" is marketing talk by ISPs to try to get someone to pay more for the Internet connection you already paid for.",eli5

Therefore, they migrate from the part of the plant bathed in sunlight to the shaded region in the stem. Once there, the auxins (which are essentially growth hormones) stimulate the growth of cells. This causes the stem to become bulkier in the shaded region, so the flower ends up bending in the opposite direction – towards the Sun! As the Sun moves across the sky, the auxins also continue to migrate to the part of the stem that is shaded, continually making the shaded part bulkier by stimulating cell growth.

206jhf,What are the scientifically proven causes of cancer? I feel like the majority of what I hear is speculation. What have we learned so far that we KNOW causes cancer?,"Generally speaking, cancer occurs when there is uncontrolled cell growth.  Normal cell turnover is a highly regulated process with multiple checkpoints that ensure that abnormal cells die and normal cells live and grow up until a certain point.  There are many, many genes that control these processes.  In the majority of cancers, multiple genes need to become mutated.  This is known as the [multiple-hit theory of cancer](_URL_1_).

Something that causes cancer, which is called a carcinogen, is something that promotes these multiple mutations to occur.  There are many known carcinogens, but most of them cause some sort of damage to cells.  This damage prompts normal cells to replicate as part of the healing process.  Whenever cells replicate, there is a small but real chance of replication error, where the DNA isn't copied 100% correctly.  However, all it takes is one cell to become cancerous and replicate itself, in order to set the stage for cancer.  If there is repeated exposure to damage over time, and millions of cells are replicating, this small chance of DNA replication error becomes a real possibility.

It is also important to remember that just because something is a known carcinogen, such as smoking, not everybody who smokes gets cancer.  Smoking certainly is an important risk factor because of all the damage it causes to the native tissue.  It creates a milieu that predisposes an individual to cancer, when compared to normal, healthy tissue.  However, for cancer to develop, the correct mutations still need to occur, which is still a matter of chance, even if the odds are increased.

To more directly answer your question, the American Cancer Society has a list of known and probable carcinogens: [_URL_0_](_URL_0_)",eli5

agafrb,Humans suffer from muscle atrophy when they don't use muscles for extended periods of time. How come bears can hibernate for months and be just fine?,"The method isn't clear, as others have said, but there's a key difference - humans are weird, in that our muscle needs can change very quickly. There's a benefit to being able to build up muscle mass in one are as needed, then lose it when it's not needed. So if an early human had to spend a month travelling, by the end of it, they'd have strong legs. Then they need to build a shelter, and if the leg muscles remained, they'd take a lot of calories to maintain. So upper body muscles would build, lower body would fade. 

It lets humans be efficient. 

Bears, on the other hand, gonna bear. Their muscle needs are relatively consistent, so there's no good reason to have the muscles atrophy during hibernation - those bears that remain strong through hibernation would have a better chance at surviving than those who do not.

lumvt,"Why ""Gravity"" Does Not Exist So I've been hearing a lot of theories as to why newton's traditional idea of gravity is wrong. But a lot of these explanations are complicated and a little over my head. Does anyone know about this/how to explain it?","Newton said gravity is a mysterious force that affects everything with mass. He didn't know what causes this force but he did create some useful equations.

Then Einstein came up with General Relativity. He says that mass bends space-time and that's why things are attracted to each other. For Example, if you put 2 heavy balls on a trampoline, they warp the trampoline and move towards each other. This is just an analogy, but it helps give you the idea.

This warping of space-time has some other side affects, which allows General Relativity to predict and explain thing that Newton's law doesn't (like small changes in the orbit of planets, light bending around stars, and clocks in GPS satellites running slower).",eli5

6rss1p,Why do some people salt the water they cook their pasta in? ,"First, lets debunk the common myth that it is done to raise the boiling point. THIS IS FALSE. The formula for the change in the boiling point of water is deltaT=Kbi. You can read about what these letters mean [here](_URL_0_). If you add 60 grams of salt to 4 liters of water(this is adding about 3 tablespoons of table salt to a gallon of water), the equation reads deltaT=(.512)(.25)(1.9) = .25 degrees Celsius. This is half a degree of temperature change in Fahrenheit, a miniscule change in temperature.

The real reason for salting pasta water is that salt makes flavors more flavorful. You can try this with almost any food. Boil  and mash a potato, and try some. Then add some salt, and try again. it will taste more potato-y. In short, we salt pasta to make it taste more like pasta.",eli5

3tv4oy,"What's the difference between underwater pressure and space pressure, and why haven't we explored the ocean as much as space? Edit: Thanks for all the answers! Im sorry if I came off as ignorant on the subject, but I know more now, heh.","(edited) There is nearly zero pressure in space, but if you had a spacecraft with air for humans to live in inside, there would be pressure pushing *outwards.* This is sometimes referred to as negative 'gauge pressure.' Similarly, in a submarine you have more pressure outside than inside, so it's pushing *inwards* - positive gauge pressure.

Humans need the pressure to be about one 'atmosphere,' or 101kPA, to survive - more, and you have difficulty breathing, can bruise, or in extreme cases be crushed and die; less, and you can't absorb oxygen, and in extreme cases your blood can form bubbles ('the bends') and you can die.

Deep underwater, because water is heavier than air, there is high pressure, and underwater ships or dive suits need to be engineered to hold up the massive weight of water around them. In space, there is near-zero pressure, so ships (for people) need to be engineered to hold the *air in.* But they only need to be able to withstand one atmosphere of pressure pushing outwards. 

For every ten meters of water you dive under, you add about another atmosphere's worth of pressure, so diving on the ocean floor means dealing with thousands of times more pressure.",eli5

431qgu,How does a blow to the head cause unconsciousness? ,"It is not so much the blow to the head that causes the problem but the forces associated with it. The skull does a great job absorbing the blow, but the forces cause your head to get pushed back pretty quickly. Your skull gets knocked back, but your brain is in a fluid and stays stationary. That causes your brain to hit your skull and the collision between the 2 causes bruising and swelling.

Imagine you are in a car driving 65 and your friend has a ball in the palm of their hand. You hit the brakes, and the car stops, but the tennis ball wants to keep going, so it flies forward into your windshield. It's the same principle, your skull is the car and the tennis ball is your brain.

2kmfhr,"What does it mean for an animal to ""domesticate itself"" (e.g cats) and why would any animal want to do it? ","TLDR: friendly cats did better, because humans.

Before i say anything else, I want to say that most of what I am about to type is stuff i've heard over the years via word of mouth, so I can't cite many sources.

When i was told about cats ""domesticating themselves"", I was taught that they approached, hung around, and followed human settlements because of the free food. Where there's people, there's food. Where there's food, there's pests - such as rodents. Cats in the old days probably hunted these rodents, and humans probably let them because they're useful pest control and super adorable.

Over time, these cats probably grew used to humans. Humans may have even taken some of the cats in as kittens to keep as pets. When a cat's food is around humans, those the least afraid of humans will likely catch the most food, live the longest, and have the most babies. These brave/sociable kitties may have passed on their tendency for human-toleration to their offspring. This would gradually leading to the population of cats being more used to humans.

Humans who took in cats as pets may have decided to let the most friendly cats breed, leading to friendly kittens. Something similar to the process mentioned in the previous paragraph would occur, and you'd end up with more ""domesticated"" cats.

With the right kind of paint, some thinner, time, and patience, it can totally be done.

The technique is prone to drips and runs.

Spraying is inefficient due to overspray, expensive due to equipment, and hard because you need a fair amount of technique and practice to get it right, but it's also fast and works on all the nuanced surfaces of a car.

You can also spray rustoleum, if you'd like. You don't have to use expensive automotive paints, and you can roll the expensive automotive paints if you want, you just have to blend the chemistry different so the paint bucket doesn't go solid on you in the time you're going to spend rolling.",eli5

3xeq2g,Why do we need sleep? ,"Registered sleep tech here.

I like to explain it to my patient's like a car. If you have a car without fuel the car won't go. Your body is the same way, it gets the fuel by sleeping. My more detailed explanation is below:

 Sleep is a VERY important part of you life. You will spend about 1/3 of it sleeping, it is when your body heals, restores, and saves your memory. Studies have shown that your brain actually prioritizes memory to keep what is most relevant first (this was tested by teaching a group of people a pattern, some were allowed to sleep others weren't, some were told they would be tested and others not, the ones who sleep and we're told to remember the pattern had 100% success, the others were hit or miss most notably the people who didn't sleep and didn't know they would be tested.) your sleep is also responsible for a lot of your health. Your body burns fat and converts it into energy for the day faster while sleeping, it also gives the body a chance to heal as you aren't putting it under any stress. 



I'm also going to take this chance for a PSA. If you:
- wake up feeling tired all the time
 - wake up feeling like you're choking or gasping for air
- snore
- have a neck circumference over 16 inches
-Fall asleep at inappropriate times
-The inability to sleep 
-Creepy crawly sensations in your legs that makes you have to move them when your trying to sleep 
Please talk to a doctor about a possible sleep study. Sleep is honestly THE most important part of your life, if your sleep isn't right your body will pay in the long run. 



Ps sorry for this looking like crap, I'm on mobile.",eli5

5kwlxn,"Why did it take humans so long to invent electricity and technology? We have been on earth many years, why has human taken so long to invent technology and electricity?","Answer is food. More specifically, leftover food and technology helping to create any. Leftover food leads to innovation.

Hunters and gatherers ate when they scored something. Their menu was highly luck-based and everyone had to hunt and gather to be able to eat at all.

Agriculture introduced winter stocks and some leftover food. Leftover food meant everyone didn't have to farm all the time to eat, so there were now craftsmen, merchants and scholars who innovated, offering their services in exchange for food so they didn't have to farm themselves. Still, farming was hard work and leftover food was little. And what craftsmen did also left little time to just wonder and ponder, a carpenter's work isn't much easier than farmer's.

But still thanks to craftsmen, technology started to emerge. All sorts of mills and basic machinery. Also, animal husbandry helped a lot.
Leftover time meant people had time to study and experiment, which led to new technologies.

So technology got going and the more of it there was, the bigger population grew thanks to leftover food. And more people = more chance of one of them being an innovator, discovering or inventing something.
So it's basically food  >  population  >  innovation.

Today almost no one in western world needs to spend time to have food, a big burger can feed you for a day and to buy it you have to work a mere hour or even half, so both population and number of (potential) innovators grows and grows, while people have potentially tons of time to learn and innovate.

There's also religion which ate a ton of free time of the people back then and restricted many explanations that would otherwise speed up technological advance.",eli5

54n5jd,Why do some countries have different birth rates between men and women? Why is it that countries like China have a massive difference between men and women with men being born so much more often. Then there are some like Ukraine with fewer men? Does this have something to do with culture?,"The actual conception rate of male and female babies is pretty much identical around the world.

In some countries, it is more desirable to have a particular sex of child. China is a good example. When the Chinese government implemented the One Child Policy, adoption rates of baby Chinese girls skyrocketed. This is because in Chinese culture, a male is viewed as more important than a female. So for the parents who are only allowed to have one child, they want to ensure it is the gender they want. 

There is also selective neglect. Similar to the above, some countries feel that having a male is better for the family as a whole. Take parts of Africa, for example. When speaking of very poor African countries, they have little to no access to birth control, meaning they will inevitably birth a lot of children. However, male children tend to grow to be stronger, play a bigger and more important role in the tribe/community, etc. If the family already has low funds and nourishment to begin with, the bulk of the nourishment will go to the child that the family believes will have the highest success rate, and who will be able to support them in their old age.",eli5

w6mb3,"why I would want to use a credit card instead of a debit card. I think I understand the basics but I'd like to confirm what I think I know.
Update: thanks for the wealth of advice. I think the most compelling reasons boil down to:

1) boosting my credit score which is useful for other credit cards and loans and such.

2) Perks from credit card companies that make using them more worthwhile (ie sky miles, points etc)

These benefits are contingent on being a responsible credit card user and paying your bill in full monthly. ","Let's say your favorite candy store had three prices on everything: one price for people paying with debit cards, one price for responsible people with credit cards, and one price for irresponsible people with credit cards.

Your favorite candy is $1 for debit card people, $1.14 for the irresponsible kids, and $.99 for the responsible credit card users.  It might not be a big difference, but you realize that since you eat hundreds if not thousands of these candies a year, the savings add up over time.

The reason for this is that when you're irresponsible with your credit card you build up debt and that candy you bought will wind up costing you more.  Debit cards are like paying with cash you have, so that's no difference.  However some credit cards will give you rewards in the form of points or cash back that usually comes out to 1%.

Yes, the irresponsible person is also getting points but it's a drop in a bucket compared to the debt they're racking up.  However the responsible candy-buyer is paying his candy tab every month and after buying 1k candies finds he can get 10 free candies via the points he accumulated.",eli5

1mhpx8,"why in Germany or The Netherlands the youth unemployment rate is under 9% while in countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal the same rate ranges from a 40% to 60%? ","It is often a statistical illusion (but not always).

Employment is calculated as ""number of people employed"" divided by ""ACTIVE population"" which is the population looking for a job.
In order to have high figure of employment (ie a low for UNemployment), you can either have a high number of people employed AND/OR a LOW active population.

Unlike what most journalists say, an unemployment rate is not the percentage of youth NOT having a job, it is the percentage of youth IN THE ACTIVE POPULATION, not having a job. If almost no youth is in the active population, a high unemployment in that category is not a problem.

Countries have VASTLY different active population, especially for the youth. 

If in country A 80% of the youth are full time students not looking for work, and 10% are having a full time job, and 10% are looking for one, you'll have youth unemployment rate of 50% (only 20% are in the labour force, 80% are not so those are not counted to calculate the unemployment).
If in country B you have 50% of the youth as full time students, 40% having a job, and 10% looking for one (ie same overall figure as country A), you'll have a youth unemployment rate of 20%. 

But is the country B in a better situation? Are the youth of country B working because they can't afford to study (because studies are too expensive) or because they finished them early (less education than country A) or because they have a better job market?

One needs to ALSO look at the employement/total population ratio. In some countries, it is very high (ie every one works, regardless of age and sex). In others it is very low (only few categories work).


If you look at this data:
_URL_0_

You'll see for the 15-19 age bracket both sexes, VERY different Labour participation rates (ie the number of people actually in the labour force, having or looking for a job):
Germany 28.5% and Greece 8% 2012. So youth unemployement rate of let's say 10% in Germany means 2.85% of total youth are looking for a job. The same 2.85% would mean 35% unemployement in Greece because of its much lower active population.

If you look at the real figures you have for 2012 in 

A. Employment/total population:
France (9.7%) Germany (25.8%) Greece (2.8%) USA (26.1%)

B. Labour force/population
France (14.4%) Germany (28.5%) Greece (8%) USA (34.4%)

C. Unemployment rate (A/B)
France (32.7%) Germany (9.2%) Greece (65.7%) USA (24%)

But what does C represents in matter of total population? This is what is important to really gauge the scale of the problem. The number of youth looking for a job/total youth population, ie the UNEMPLOYEMENT/POPULATION. For Greece, this means 65.7% (very high scary figure) but of ONLY 8% of the youth (super low)

Here is the result, ie the percentage of youth unemployed (ie looking for a job) of the total population of youth (and not only those in the active population).

France (4.7%) Germany (2.7%) Greece (5.2%) USA (8.3%)

So the unemployment of youth concerns a much bigger part of the youth population in the US than in Greece... even though its unemployment rate is many times smaller (24% vs 65.7%)...",eli5

47o1n6,"Why do we truly taste many things only after we swallowed them? When drinking orange juice for example. While I keep chugging, I notice the flavor, but only after stop drinking and swallowing, I really taste the juice.","The taste after you swallow, called ""the after taste"", is a real part of the tasting experience.

Taste is about dissolution and absorption. These things take time and involve density of material.

So you bring something near your face and you smell it, which is part of the overall taste process.

Then it touches the wetness of your mouth. The saliva begins reacting with and carying the substance around. As each detectable molecule arrives on a sensor the signaling begins.

You process the strongest and most pervasive signal first, which is why over-salting (or any other overwhelming seasoning) or burning (as in ""this toast is burnt"") foods can ""overpower"" all the rest of the flavor.

The stuff that arrives fastest tends to depart fastest as well. So you'll get the water soluble flavors first, and the fat soluble flavors take longer to arrive and so longer to depart.

Indeed strictly fat soluble molecules can hang around a long, long time. This is why some peepers have a ""long slow build and a lasting burn"" as you eat dishes that contain them.

Some of the ""metallic"" tastes are fast ans some are slow.

And almost all tastes other than the big five instants ""sweet, salty, ~~savory~~ sour, bitter, and umami/savory"" are complex. So you've learned to associate some complex tastes with particular things. This is why people will say wine has ""earthy"" or ""woody"" ""notes"". And ""earthy note"" is the taste of dirt from your childhood, etc.

Finally alcohol content is a real kicker. The reason that most ""extracts"" (such as vanilla extract) are created by soakiing the thing (e.g. the vanilla) in alcohol is that alcohol is good for forcing both the fat and water soluble flavors out of things and then holding them in suspension.

That also means that alcohol both delivers and washes away flavors. Alcohol is therefore better at making flavors ""fast"".

And vinegar is great for bringing out flavors because the ph (acidity) makes some things more aggressive as the acid is neutralized in your mouth.

As an added bonus, once some stuff is in your blood stream trace amounts of the more volatile bits may exit the blood into your lungs and be breathed out. So like ""garlic breath"" from garlic oils. And breathing out those chemicals will re-trigger taste and smell.

So flavor is a continuous process. Alert flavors first (bitter==poison, spit it out!) and evaluation flavors second (gee, I needed some potassium) and pleasure flavors third to a large degree.

659oqr,Why does white noise help people sleep? ,"It works kind of like turning off the lights when it's time to sleep. We sleep better in the dark because our eyes don't have to process the information it receives from the light reflecting around us. White noise is kind of like being ""in the dark"" sonically.

White noise is a combination of all of the frequencies in the audible spectrum (20Hz-20kHz) with each frequency playing at the same volume. When we listen to white noise our brain doesn't have to work as hard to listen to the world around us. When sitting in silence your brain is constantly trying to decipher what is happening around you. As I sit in my empty apartment I hear the hum of the freezer and the distant coughs of a next door neighbor because my ears are trying to gather as much information about my surroundings. Even when you sleep your inner ear is fully functional. It's part of our survival habits as humans. If you listen to white noise your brain basically has no information to gather because it is hearing every frequency sound at the same time, thus allowing your brain to relax your sense of hearing. 

Have you ever heard of sensory deprivation chambers? They put you in a pitch black tank filled with body temp salt water (so you float) and blast white noise. This allows all of your senses to relax to the point where your brain has no external stimuli and it begins to create its own. Never tried it but sounds like a trip.

During later development when genitalia is specialized, your assigned sexual organ develops, but your opposite genitalia doesn't disappear. (For men, this vestigial organ is the vagina masculina, and women have a clitoris.) So it's the same with nipples.

The bottom line is, of course, money (or the perception of it). But let's back up a bit. 

The main difference between a movie and a video game is that a video game is an interactive experience. It's an activity you're actually *performing*. Watching a movie is an activity, but it's basically happening *to* you. 

When you see someone play a game, it makes you want to try it. Furthermore, you can do it *differently* that the other person. You can do it *your* way and have a unique experience. When you see someone watch a movie, it does not make you want to watch the movie. 

So there's nothing in it for the movie studios. Letting you have their entire movie online doesn't benefit them. 

If would also likely bore the hell out of everyone, but that's besides the point.

Let's look at another aspect: you can't really put an entire (modern) game online. You can't do an entire *Skyrim* playthrough video. Sure, you can do a ""look how fast I got through the main questline!"" video, but that's, what, 5% of the game? Plus, once again, if I play it, it won't be the same as when you did. 

Furthermore, note that there *are* popular youtube channels that thrive on movie commentary, and will show up to 20+ minutes of a movie! This is Fair Use and perfectly legal. If you *wanted* to stream yourself commenting on a movie, you *can* do it within the provisions of the law.",eli5

2xjtco,"How do we know what causes cancer? Is it just a list of stuff that can be linked to it, or is there a way to tell if something can cause cancer? ","There are two basic angles we can come at - one is based in theory, the other in correlations.

On the one hand, we have a broad idea of what's wrong with cancer cells: namely, certain genes that are supposed to stop them from dividing out of control aren't working. So then we look at what can damage genes in that way. Things like radiation, certain chemicals, genetic disorders, or viral infections can cause problems with the genes in question, and in those cases we can trace exactly how one causes the other.

On the other hand, we can look for correlations. For example, we notice that certain types of cancer are really common in people with AIDS. This indicates that normally, those cancers must be suppressed by the immune system - so if we see that type of cancer, we can suspect that something is blocking your immune system. Or we might notice that certain groups - say, cigarette smokers - have way higher cancer rates than other groups, and suspect that whatever defines that group somehow causes cancer.

179ah0,"Why is it that when you buy virtually any sandwich-steak in a box, it has a mellow flavor, and when you buy it from a butcher it has a ""gamey"" flavor? does it have something to do with the processing of the meat?","Are we comparing like Stakeums to actual ribeye steak? 

Most ""processed"" meats have other stuff in them, like preservatives, saline, ect. That alters the flavor. Even if you get something ""organic"" or ""all-natural"", the act of freezing the meat can change the flavor and quality of the meat. This becomes more obvious the more it stays frozen. And who knows how long that box of Steakums has been sitting in freezers, and on freezer trucks. 

Compare this to fresh Ribeye from your butcher (or even just from the meat bunkers at your local supermarkets. Most meat there is still mostly fresh and pure). The meat isnt frozen, and it comes from an animal that was recently slaughtered. That means its fresh, and will be higher in quality than the same meat which was slaughtered in Oklahoma and shipped out to a factory to be made into Steakums, then shipped out to you. Also, most butchers utilize local meats which are increasingly organic and ""humane"". 

Compared to ""mass produced"" meats (even like the stuff in your local supermarket), this local beef does not usually go through the feed lot system while most commercial beef does. This is where the questionable practices are found. Usually this cattle is pumped full of antibiotics, and they are fed by cheaper feed than cattle normally get. This can significantly alter flavor. 

Also important is the quality Grade[The link isnt working for me, its on the Beef wiki pages, halfway down its under the heading of USDA Beef Grades. The direct link is _URL_0_] of the beef. The main two are USDA Prime(best quality) and USDA Choice(great quality) (this assumes your living in the US, I dont know how other countries do this). Also, there exists Select(good) Standard(Meh) and Commercial(subMeh). Beef, in my experience are rarely advertised these lower grades, though sometimes you might see something as USDA select. Then there is cheaper lower quality meat which isnt sold in stores(even commerical is usually not sold in supermarkets). This grading represents the quality and fat content of the beef. The higher the grade, the more fat. The more fat, the more flavor. **As a note:** in this case you want *more fat*, not only does it make the beef taste better, but it means the cow was raised with more care. Lower grade beef can come from older and less fit cattle; its cheaper in every sense of the word. Steakums, and other freezer beef is usually from USDA Standard or more commonly USDA Commercial grade beef. That means the beef is cheaper and of a lower quality, and that means less of that tasty tasty fat. On the other hand, Local beef can be of a higher quality even if it is still ungraded. Most Local beef competes through quality, not through price or accessibility. 

All this is to assume your comparing two similar cuts of beef. Different cuts (Ribeye comes from the middle back of a cow. Literally the Rib meat.) can have different flavor. Unless the packaging explicitly tells you where the meat was cut from, it can be difficult to determine exactly what your eating. 

**TL;DR:** the USDA Grade quality(fat content) of beef can effect flavor. As can age, animal diet, cut, personal seasoning, commercial seasoning, and any preservatives added into the meat.",eli5

Research has shown that when that happens, your brain doesn't develop the ability to discern between that sound and a similar sound.   
  
Or in other cases, they could just be ""lazy"" speakers.  I did not enunciate certains sounds well as a child, for example. I heard them fine, and could discriminate them, but for some reason I did not make them clearly when speaking.  When I was about 10 years old I was put in a special speech class to improve my speaking of ""R"" and ""L"" sounds. Once I actually concentrated on making those sounds well, I improved quickly. I was simply unaware that what I was speaking and what I was intending to speak were not the same.",eli5

3tq3mc,Why did it take until 1959 for Alaska and Hawaii to become states? ,"Hawaii was an independent kingdom until WWII threatened it.  It's a great pit stop if you have to fly bombers from Japan to the US, and vice versa.  The U.S. saw no point in annexing it until the war, and then after, with the cold war, Hawaii would make a great place to put a base to fly into and bomb the USSR. Before that, there was no point, and Hawaiian people were happy as an independent nation.  There is still a large group of native Hawaiians that want to drop Statehood and bring back the monarchy, or some sort of independent government.
Alaska was seen largely as worthless, cold, and vast expanses of land, but was a US territory as early as 1912.  Though there was gold and fishing, Statehood wasn't a huge question until WWII.  
Look at the geography of the Aleutian Islands, and how close they are to the former USSR.  Ms. Palin, after all, can see Russia from her back yard.  Statehood grants certain rights to the U.S. military that Territories lack, and so the real push for Statehood began when the Japanese invaded in 1942 and 43.  Then, after using Alaska as a way to ferry planes over to Russia to fight the German invasion, and again, the flaring up of the Cold War, Alaska became a great strategic holding,  Most of our nuclear missiles, as well as commercial planes bound for Japan or Russia, will fly over Alaska (shortest point to point on a globe is a curve).
Plus, with the discovery of major oil reserves in Alaska, Statehood was assured.
Still, just like Hawaii, though to a lesser extent, many Alaskans would like to throw off the yoke of the lower 48, and live free of government meddling.",eli5

4fxkcv,How do some songs utilize the effect where a part of the song plays in one ear and another part in the other ear. Or when the song switches between your two ears. ,"Digital audio (music, in this case) can be put together, or recorded from virtually any number of separate pieces- or sources. Take an average rock song for example. All of the individual instruments/ sounds you hear, like the drum set, electric guitar, bass guitar, and the lead singers vocals, are all separate sources of sound, and the actual song that you hear through your speakers, is the just combination of all those individual sounds, when they are all played at the same time. That is how it works when recording a live, physical, band or musician. Each individual instrument or voice is called a source. 

After taking all those separate sources, then recording them all together, and saving that recording on a computer, you have a basic audio file. If you want, you can stop at that step, and can listen to that audio file, but it will sound very flat, even if you play it through headphones or speakers, because all of those sounds are still stuck together, and will make the music sound like all of the separate instruments and voices come from the same direction, flat on top of each other.

To experience music like you were asking about, where you can hear different parts of the song in your left ear than what you hear in your right, you have to take that one, solid audio file you made, and cut it back up into separate pieces (sounds) again. These pieces that you cut the original file back into, are called channels. If you do not cut up the file at all, you only get one channel (which is called mono sound), which sounds flat and boring. If you cut that file in half into two pieces, you get two separate channels, (which is called stereo sound). Stereo sound is the simplest form of audio that will let you hear something in one ear, and a different thing through the other ear.

You can use this in different ways. You could separate the sounds, so that you hear the bass guitar and drums through your left ear, and the electric guitar and vocals through your right ear, instead of hearing all of them in both ears. You could also choose to hear all sounds in both ears, but have the right ear only play half as loud as the left. There are many possibilities that can be done, even with just two-piece stereo sound. If you cut that original file into six pieces, you will end up with 6 channels. *5.1* Surround Sound basically means *5* channels for speakers, and *1* channel for a subwoofer (speaker that hits deep notes.

tl;dr  *or* Simplest Answer: 
Step 1: Record live, or digitally create an audio file.
Step 2: Split file into 2 channels for stereo sound, or into 6, 8, or more channels for surround sound.

5t0qst,Why do we randomly stutter or horribly mispronounce words we know even thought we have no actual speech impediment?,"Have you ever seen a sign on the wall of a shop that says something like:

* Good
* Fast
* Cheap

**Pick Two**

That's essentially what's going on with our brains. A human brain uses up about 20% of the food we eat everyday, which is a lot for something that doesn't have to move us around or pump blood or anything 'strenuous' like that - but they could use a lot more. A computer that could do what our brains do would be enormous and would use thousands or millions of kWh of electricity. So, our brains are actually pretty efficient or ""cheap"" for what they do, which includes things like figuring out the right things to say and how to pronounce each word whenever we have to talk.

So, if they're ""cheap"" that means that they can't be as good and fast as we'd like. They're going to make mistakes sometimes. It's better to get the words right 99% of the time and be pretty fast and efficient, then it is to get the words right 100% of the time and be huge and use way more calories all the time.

**Edit** - For a non ELI5 way to think of it we can [think of our brains as lossy compression of things we've learned](_URL_0_). Instead of perfectly mapping inputs to outputs we map the responses on top of each other where possible, which results in a network.

5wb6jp,why does America have so many standardized tests? ,"Standardization in general is usually a result of a growing population.  Basically, when you're dealing with a smaller set of people, you have a better chance of understanding the differences of each person and providing solutions to accommodate such things.  As the pool of people you need to account for grows, you're less likely going to be able to provide such accommodations (usually due to budget/time constraints).

Standardization attempts to resolve this by trying to account for the most general cases and providing solutions to those cases.  That way we only have to make sure everybody is on relatively the same page, and then follow a predefined plan of execution.

In the case of standardized testing, there are a number of factors that combined to put us in the situation we are today (for better or worse).  Essentially, employers (as well as other entities such as colleges) need to know that a ""High School Graduate"" from a small school in Missouri has an equivalent school experience as someone from a large city in New York.  Standardization of schooling across the country, and specifically in testing, makes this possible.

The iconic example, of course, is the SAT.  Although it's accuracy is up for debate, the point of the SAT is to provide a number per person which allows individuals to be compared and ranked based on their results.  So if you are from Japan and I'm from New York and we're both applying to college in California, the people in charge of applications there can immediately determine which one of us is a stronger applicant, and by how much, just by comparing our SAT scores.  We might not even speak the same language, but the process of standardization eliminates such factors.

As a side note:  standardization, and especially standardized testing, isn't just a feature of American cultures.  Many countries with large populations and modern education systems use standardized testing in some form, and usually rather frequently (again, I point to college admissions as being prime examples).  There has been a lot of recent controversy in relying on such tests (IQ tests, for example, are often seen as ""inaccurate"" in modern times), but there really isn't a better way of doing things at this point.  Living in such large (and sometimes global) civilizations force us to have to be able to communicate with one another.  Standardization is one way of doing this.  But perhaps as technology advances and better insights into testing and ranking come to light, our current testing systems will be seen as inaccurate and archaic themselves.

Edit:  This is more of a gloss-over than than an actual answer.  Someone needs to chime-in with the actual history of US standardized testing, which is pretty interesting in itself.",eli5

In the events leading up to and including The Hobbit, he hasn't yet begun to be controlled by Sauron, but he does want to leave Sauron alone in the hope that the lost One Ring would turn up as well (hence, he counsels against attacking Dol Goldur at the 2851 White Council).  Saruman then goes off to start looking for the ring, at Gladden Fields where the Ring was lost when Isildur was killed.

Then at a later White Council meeting, at a time when Bilbo has found the ring and events are moving forward swiftly, Saruman switches course and says they should attack Dol Goldur to keep Sauron from reaching the river. Sauron leaves DG, the Battle of the Five Armies happens.

Only 50 years after those events does Saruman use the Palantir, establishing the mental connection to Sauron.

So you could say he doesn't really ""defect"" since from very early on, he's trying to gain power for himself.  He was never a truly stand up guy, in other words.  But, he only begins to be controlled directly because of his desire for power when he uses the Palantir.

Edit: pushes glasses up nose, adjusts pocket protector. Thanks for the gold!",eli5

i3 2.2ghz

ATI 5650 card.

I'm thinking it's the processor, if I had upgraded, would the performance be similar? XBOX - 3 cores. My CPU - 2. 

I'm not asking for tech help, just wondering why.","This is not a general question that can be answered, the reason is specific to each game.

Mirror's Edge had some real problems with its physics engine. It used a technology called PhyX to simulate physics, which in some setups can drastically reduce performance. Turning off PhysX will prob sort your problems with mirrors edge.


On a more general note, the hardware in all xboxes are exactly the same, however almost every PC in the world has a slightly different configuration of memory, CPU, graphics, etc. That means that its very easy for developers to write for, and test on the fixed hardware of consoles, and be sure it'll always work fine.

2kjwek,"Why don't those infomercial machines that move your muscles for you so you lose weight work? Inspired by the out-of-this-world infomercial for the 'Hawaii chair' seen in an askreddit thread: _URL_0_ .   
Aside from this complete ridiculousness, I think I've seen quite a few infomercials showing some kind of machine you attach to your abs or so, and it pulsates and moves the muscles for you, supposedly strengthening them, and burning calories at the same time.    
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that it's complete bullshit...but why?  
","Your muscles are strengthened when they're damaged and need to heal back.  What you're doing when you lift weights is literally tearing the muscles (a little bit - tearing them a lot is bad).  Your body then heals back up stronger than it was before.  While it's theoretically someone could build a 'muscle-tearing machine', it would be incredibly hard to properly calibrate so it would do something useful without injuring you.

In terms of weight loss, it's no different than the fact that your car doesn't burn fuel when you push it.  You lose weight by consuming less calories than you need, so this means you need the muscles to actually do work.  If you've got an external device doing all the work for you, you don't burn any calories.",eli5

(Update)
Our human body is composed of water for the majority, and when water freezes in expands. How come it shrinks when it's in cold water?","Penis size is regulated by blood flow into the penis.  The mechanism behind an erection, for example, is pretty much just an increase in blood flow to that part of the body.  This causes the penis to expand much like a balloon when it's filled with water.  In other words, there is a relationship between blood flow and penis size.

Heat regulates blood flow.  When the temperature is low, the body undergoes vasoconstriction, the constriction of the tubes that carry blood throughout the body.  By making these tubes smaller, less heat is exchanged between the blood and the outside environment, so the blood stays warm.  However, vasoconstriction also decreases the blood flow to the penis, which as explained in the first paragraph, affects size.",eli5

Flies are basically ""live fast, die young"", they trade-off for the large amount of offspring they can produce by having relatively short life spans. They reach sexual maturity quickly, mate, have many many offspring and then die. Elephants take years to mature sexually, and trade-off for their long lifespan by having only one offspring (rarely two) at a time. Of course there are other characteristics to consider (size like you mentioned, large animals trade off for the size by having a small amount offspring and vice versa, the amount of time parents spend nurturing the offspring, etc). 


So basically one characteristic is traded in for another to help maintain the balance; if animals could live forever, mature quickly, and produce many offspring they would be evolutionary monsters and take over the world.",eli5

zm3o4,why lightning is rare during snowstorms. Only once in my whole life have I seen a lightning strike during a snowstorm. Why is it so rare?,"Ok, everybody has at least a piece of the puzzle here, but let me see if I can hash this out before my nyquil kicks in. If this turns into a pile of mush toward the end, I'll fix it in the morning, I promise.

Helix400 has the best info so far. Thunder-snow is uncommon, but exactly how uncommon varies widely based on geographic location. Here on the south shores of the Great Lakes, it isn't that uncommon with lake-effect snow squalls. It happens around here (NW PA) probably 4 or 5 times a year.

I'm going to do my very best to keep this as ELI5 as I can, but call me out if I go too technical. So, lightning is the product of big potential differences, AKA voltage. Potential differences want to equalize.

To use a universal analog, you have socks on and scuff your feet across a carpet on a dry day. You're stealing electrons from the carpet as you move. Eventually, while carrying around this abundance of electrons, you touch something that has a (relative) deficit of electrons, like a door knob, and you get a spark as the excess electrons make the jump from you, to this electron-deficient object. The spark actually jumps long before your touch the doorknob. The spark can jump about 1.1mm for every 1,000 volts of difference between you and the doorknob, and they can be up to 3cm long for a really good zap. That's almost 30,000 volts! The 'snap' you hear when you get shocked is from that spark. You make baby thunder every time you zap your girlfriend while wearing your favorite Christmas sweater.

Lightning is much the same. Thunderstorms move an absolutely incredible volume of air around through convective currents (hot air rises, cold air sinks). These air currents rub against the ground, each other, as well as against moisture in the atmosphere (in the form of ice, rain, and gaseous water), and they trade electrons. With time, a large enough potential difference develops between either two clouds, or the ground and the cloud base, that a spark can jump the gap between the two objects. Lightning.

Now, really tall and fast updrafts do lots of different things to give these air currents lots of things to rub against to either steal electrons from, or give electrons to. They can hold more precipitation and dust aloft, they can create much larger clouds, and by moving faster, can also  transport these electrons more efficiently.

These updrafts work on convection. The surface of the Earth is really good at absorbing the sun's energy, and by proxy, the air in the lowest 2,000' or so of the atmosphere is really easy to warm up on a bright sunny day. The warm air at the surface starts to rise, because it's warmer than all the air above it. If everything goes smoothly, it will keep rising pretty much until it hits the Tropopause, somewhere between 4 and 10 miles above your head (depending on your geographic location). The hotter the air at the surface, the bigger the temperature difference it will usually encounter as it rises, and so the faster it will rise. This is instability.

If the air at the surface is relatively cold, let's say -3C, the difference in temperature between the surface and aloft isn't very big, so the warm(er) air from the surface can't rise very fast, or very high. A really kick ass Great Plains thunderstorm can top out somewhere very close to 55,000 feet above the ground. More than 10 miles high. Even a really rockin' snow storm will very rarely be taller than 15,000'. This really makes it hard for the air currents in a snow storm to move enough electrons around, and do it long enough, to generate lightning.

The most common exception is around really big bodies of water like the Great Lakes. Lake Erie absorbs heat from the sun, but can't get rid of it very quickly. If a really really cold pool of air moves out of Canada early in the winter, and sits over the lake, the lake could be up to 30 degrees warmer than the air right above it. A really thin layer of air near the surface of the lake heats up and picks up a ton of moisture from the lake, then starts to rise in to the super cold air above it. If the water fell back to the lake right away, it would land as drizzle or snow/rain mix, as the snow flakes melted right before hitting the water in that warm layer of air. If the wind is right though, that rising air is being pushed over the land as it rises, so when it falls, it ends up over dry land where the temperature at the surface is still below freezing.

This is the best case scenario for thunder-snow. You have the fast rising air, lots of water being held up in the air so there's something to rub against, the clouds can be pretty tall (10,000-20,000' in really butt kicking squalls) so there is lots of time for the electrons to move around as well.

Because the temperature difference is still not as extreme as if the surface was say, 30C, it won't be as much lightning as a really good summer thunderstorm, but there will be lightning, and it will be snowing like hell. Thunder-snow is *always* very very **VERY** heavy snow, or snow/sleet mix. The most intense electrical snow storm I've personally witnessed was producing snowfall at almost 6"" per hour, and kept up a total whiteout for more than 2 hours (December 2001, Syracuse, NY).

This is just a fact of anatomy, and by no means sexist. This means that men will usually complete a higher volume of work in labor-intensive jobs than women. Therefore, there's really no sense in trying to push women into jobs that require heavy lifting, fast-paced, continuous labor, or all-around ""rough conditions"".  

This is the same reason why there are no women (that I know of) in Special Forces and such military groups. Women are certainly *allowed* to apply or join, but it is plainly impossible for women to keep up with the ridiculous amount of physical fitness those kinds of soldiers need to maintain.

You could probably do all that at a low resolution for a small fire. (See [here](_URL_0_) for a paper with a fire rendering method) but it would suck up so much resources that the game would be nearly unplayable when there are multiple/big fires. So most devs just create a few animations of fire and then loop them. Or they just do it with particles. It looks really fake, but it's the only way to realistically do things if you want fire in your game.",eli5

A week later I sustained a pretty bad finger sprain while camping (also got lots of bug bites) - the bug bites and sprain seem to be taking longer to heal than they normally would - is this because of my injured tailbone? How does your body react to healing itself when there are multiple injuries? Does it prioritize? Does it address everything at a slower pace than if there was just one injury? Does it have any effect at all? ","Your body requires synthesis of material for activities like exudation (anti bacterial response), epithelial regeneration (skin healing from bites), collagen fibers (bone healing from bruise), etc. Each of these pieces require material synthesis. The body is like a factory that can make it's own materials. However, there is always a maximum throughput value. The speed at which any two bodies can create requires materials will not be the same. However, seemingly different materials may require similar inputs. If two injuries require the same material for healing at a rate greater than the body can produce then your healing will be delayed.

1kpsnq,Why don't airlines board the LAST row of seats FIRST and continue this trend from back to front? i understand that first class gets preferential treatment.,"Sometimes they *do* do this, but it all depends on the individual flight.

The biggest problem is logistics; ensuring that the passengers themselves can queue in the right order, and what to do if they get it wrong.

If an attendent *only* calls Row Z, and waits for all passengers to arrive before calling Row Y, etc, you're creating another bottleneck of slow processing, just in a different place. What if Row Z are in the bathroom? What if they're still getting through security? What if they just didn't hear the announcement? Is it the flight attendant's responsibility to know where everyone is in the terminal? If someone from Row S steps into their place, are the attendants supposed to say ""No"" and make them wait, even though it's a businessmen with no hand-luggage who flies all the time and won't cause any hassle at all?

Figuring out the queueing order is actually a big topic of debate in airlines, you'll be pleased to know :-) They understand the system's not great, but it's a matter of finding something that *is* great. The real area of improvement has nothing to do with the order of Rows, but rather understanding the traveling conditions of each passenger.

2rid5a,What is the difference between memory used in RAM and memory used in a hard drive; and why is 32Gb of RAM so much more expensive than a 32Gb hard drive? ,"Kitchen analogy: 

RAM is your countertop. It's where your food sits just before you prepare it. (Your cooker/burner is the CPU in this analogy) There's quite a bit of space, but you wouldn't want to store all your food on the counter all the time because it's inefficient and would be very expensive.

The Hard Drive is your pantry and refrigerator. Things stay in storage there until you need it and pull it to the countertop to prepare. When you are finished preparing, you can store your result in the refrigerator or in the pantry and have the countertop ready for the next dish. Because you can store things more efficiently in the pantry (thanks to shelves), it's cheaper because you make better use of the space you have.

When it comes to the electronics: RAM is designed for very fast in-out data and that design is expensive. The hard drive doesn't have to have that same design, it's made to put stuff in and keep it for the long haul. It doesn't *have* to move data as fast. So it's cheaper.

Do we know the **neurological reason** why ravens are so smart? p.s. [this question](_URL_0_) has been asked before but is this the answer? I feel there's more to it.","We know a few things that define highly inteligent animals, including ourselves:

* They tend to be highly social. Social animals have to navigate a complex world where understanding who is friend, foe, or unknown is critical. It becomes critical to know who stood up for you in the last fight, who will help you defend your territory, and who is going to lie and steal your stuff. Animals don't necessarily remember events in the way we can recall past events (although higher apes some may). It is more likely they remember impressions of individuals based on past events, they remember the feeling or emotion that individual gave them from past interactions.

* They live in complex environments. Highly intelligent animals tend to live in environments and occupy a niche that is in flux, and not stable. Because of this instability they need to be able to be flexible. Food resources may be patchily distributed temporally or physically within their territory. Remembering where and when to visit a certain fruiting tree or grazing area requires more complex brain power. 

These two previous examples partially answer the question as to why intelligence developed within these animals in the first place. What pressures were put upon the species that selected them towards a higher more flexible intelligence? The following points explore what we know about the bio-physical reasons why these animals can be more intelligent than other species, what about them (and by extension us) makes them able to be so intelligent? Truth be told, this is not a solved answer by science, we don't exactly know why we or other animals are so intelligent but we do have few pretty good clues as to some factors that do influence how intelligent an animal is.

* They tend to have large brain-to-body size ratios. Its not just about brain size, its about the brain size in proportion to the body size. 

* They tend to have highly flexible neurons / neural synapses. This isn't well understood, but we do know that humans have highly flexible brain as children and even into adulthood, but that this flexibility lessens as we age. This is why children have a much easier time learning a new language than adults. Animals living in complex social worlds and environments need to have a brain that is flexible, is able to adapt, and learn. This is partially done through an increased flexibility of neuron development. Edit - another redditor made a similar comment earlier in the week and put it this concept of neural flexibility much more eloquently than I did, perhaps someone with a stronger neuro-background could comment.

* We are not aware of any gene or series of genes that code for intelligence. In all likelihood we are looking at a complex set of changes in each of these species that led to the development of higher intelligence. However, we always need to remember that in evolution there is more than one way to skin a cat. That is to say, there is more than one way to solve a problem. For example, the problem of flight was solved independently and quite differently in insects and birds. There is no reason why we should assume that biologically or physiologically that all animals must solve the problem of intelligence in the same manner.",eli5

Changing the temperature of something only changes the weight if it adds things from or looses things to the atmosphere, eg a hot glass weighs slightly less than a cold glass because there is a thin film of water on all glass surfaces at room temperature.

what is more likely is that the scales are not meant to handle hot things and the temperature will upset the mechanism it uses to determine the weight (eg if it uses a spring the spring will soften when heated)",eli5

So they will get into trouble with oversteer/understeer, turning away from a skid, and other situations that are counterintuitive.

409mdi,Why do antidepressants take several weeks to kick in but only a few missed doses to cause you to relapse? I missed two days of Wellbutrin because my doctors office has been closed and couldn't give me a refill. I'm probably worse off now than I was before I began the medication but knowing I will feel better once a week or two of consistent dosing goes by is keeping me going. Why does it take so long to start working but it only a few days to completely undo it all?,"Although this is an ELI5, the explanation by /u/Legion101010 is a bit simplistic in terms of the reason for the time to ""kick in"". 
Getting a drug's concentration high enough (or to a steady state) takes anywhere from 3-5 half lives of the medication. Meaning that for Wellbutrin, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor with a half life of 21 hours, it would take anywhere from 63-105 hours to reach a steady state. Other antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) sertraline/Zoloft (half life 26 hours) or citalopram/Celexa (half life 35 hours) would still take less than a week to reach steady state. Anyone that has taken an antidepressant knows or has been told that for full ""effect"" they need to take the medication regularly for at least 4 weeks. The reason that this onset of effectiveness takes longer than just reaching a steady state of medications is that the effect of antidepressants is secondary to a cascade of signals that eventually change the way genes are expressed. The initial events occur in less than seconds but the long term consequences are mediated by down stream messengers that take hours to days to activate. 

This cascade is the monoamine hypothesis of antidepressant action on gene expression. 
An SSRI works through multiple actions with the main action that it stops the serotonin transporter from taking serotonin out of the synapse (area between nerves where chemical transmission takes place) leaving more serotonin to be utilized in the synapse. This action takes place once the drug has reached a steady state (about 3-5 days), but in order for the antidepressant to take its full effect more time is needed. 
In depression the theorized state is a deficient amount of serotonin (not enough serotonin to saturate the receptors on the other end of the synapse). This causes an increase in the amount of serotonin receptors on the neuron as it seeks to obtain as much serotonin as possible. An SSRI increases the amount of serotonin, but originally only doing this at the beginning of the neuron. This increased serotonin causes down regulation of a specific receptor responsible for turning OFF further serotonin release. This down regulation allows the release of serotonin at the other end of the neuron. Once this takes place the amount of serotonin receptors on the next neuron are down regulated and saturated by increased serotonin available. 

The amount of time it takes for these down regulations is one thought as to why the onset of effect is delayed in antidepressant treatment. 

For Wellbutrin, the mechanism of action is still not completely understood. The leading hypothesis is that it inhibits reuptake of dopamine at the dopamine transporter as well as norepinephrine at the norepinephrine transporter. The effects of increased dopamine are felt relatively quickly in many individuals and when people start taking Wellbutrin they often times will note an increase in energy and relatively happier mood immediately that tends to taper off after a few days to a week. It is not until they take a therapeutic trial (4-6 weeks) that they get the full benefit of the medication. The sensation you note upon missing a short duration of Wellbutrin is likely related to that initial loss of dopamine.

Probably a little too long winded for a 5 year old, but interesting nonetheless!

5ha1gn,"how and why is eating meat so bad for the environment? *just quickly: I know this is a tense topic at times so let's all remember to stick to the rules, keep it civil and fact-based!* 

I would like to understand how consumption of meat makes your carbon footprint so much bigger than being vegetarian or vegan... People say it a lot and I know meat comes from animal factories but I don't 100% get why it's so bad. Why is consumption of meat so bad for the environment? 
I don't personally eat meat for other reasons (saw the 'Lisa the vegetarian' episode of the Simpsons when I was ten and basically never looked back) and I know a lot of people who say it's bad for the environment and I can guess or imagine why but I don't want to go saying that unless I personally understand HOW, and how bad. 

Is eating meat once a week still contributing massively to global warming? 
Is replacing meat with tofu or vegan protein burgers an improved carbon footprint??
Surely if someone is eating grassfed beef that come from a farm wouldn't that contribute even more to greenhouse gasses because each cow needs more space and lives longer? 

Thank you in advance! 
 (I have searched through to see if someone's asked this and have found related questions but not the same so I'm still confused.)","The main problem is cows require a lot of land for grazing. It takes a lot of grass to feed a cow. Claiming land for beef farming is the leading reason for Amazon deforestation.

One counter argument that people sometimes bring up is the fact that C02 that cows emit was only recently removed from the atmosphere by the grass they consume, so it's different from C02 that is emitted by burning coal. This is true, however, when we remove trees and replace them with grass, that land holds a lot less carbon than it did previously. A forest can sequester a significant amount of carbon dioxide, while land used for cattle grazing sequesters virtually none.",eli5

585eim,"Why do we have over 18,000 unaffiliated police departments in the United States? Why isn't there a single government agency that unites them? I guess I am asking why we have no national police force.","Because there are lots of levels of legal authority in the US, and they are largely independent of each other (by Constitutional design). Federal laws are not the same as state laws, which are different from county or city ordinances. And sometimes they conflict. No single agency has the authority to enforce all those different laws, and even when the laws coincide, the heavy lifting is often left to the lowest level of authority that can effectively do it. For example, a murder investigation is generally done by the city PD where it happens, because they can do a local investigation best... the case will then be prosecuted by the locals _unless_ it's part of a bigger batch of crimes - like a multi-state crime spree - that needs interstate authority, and then the FBI or some other fed agency gets involved. 

For the most part, a state trooper or FBI agent isn't going to write you a parking ticket. And a county sheriff's deputy isn't usually going to be running a murder investigation. Now, if a cop witnesses you breaking the law, they may be able to hold until the proper authorities do arrive, but maybe not. Each of those areas may cooperate with neighboring areas, but they might just as well jealously guard their independence.

A good example is the recent dustup in the South  &  Southwest over using local cops to do immigration enforcement. The short answer, from a legal perspective, is: they can't. State, county, or local cops are not authorized to make immigration busts for the simple fact that states, counties, and cities don't make immigration law. Only the federal gov't can do that, so only the federal gov't can enforce those laws. ICE may sometimes use local cops for additional manpower on larger raids, but the busts are all ultimately under the authority of ICE (or whoever).",eli5

- Pregnancy is also not without risk. By preventing pregnancy, you are preventing pregnancy related risks.

- Many animals can become sexually frustrated which can lead to obsessive behaviours such as licking their genitals until they bleed. 

- Spaying and neutering will change the behaviour of most animals, which puts them at less risk. It makes males less aggressive so they are less likely to get into fights. It makes your pet less likely to escape and roam. It makes your pet less likely to engage in undesired dominance behaviours (such as excessive barking or mounting or spraying). Now, these last behaviours are not necessarily physically unhealthy for these animals, but sadly, it does put them at greater risk of being too much for an owner to handle and going to a shelter.",eli5

Related question: I've also noticed websites that use links to connect to their website that are not the same as the URL (i.e. _URL_1_, etc.). Again, why do this? What function does this serve?

Edit: Thanks for all your responses! ","The endings were meant to be used by specific groups.  .org was for non profits, .edu was for colleges and schools, and .com was a catch all for businesses and other sites.  Over time, the availability of domain names caused new endings to be added such as .net, .biz, etc. Most countries have their own domains as well, which can have 2 letters instead of 3, such as .be, .fr, .cn and others.

Most of the time to use the special domains, you have to register from the country to get them, but some places allow anyone to use them, and as /u/Mason11987  pointed out, it opens up some options for creative names with domains so that people can easily remember them.

The second question about _URL_2_ has 2 main purposes, the first is shortening a url for use in links. Twitter was a big part of this because of the character limit, so it was difficult for people to post links in under 146 characters. The _URL_2_ acts as an alias so you can have a very long url like _URL_0_   reduced down to _URL_1_ 

Every _URL_2_ is unique for the page you are referencing and it lets people who own sites easily see where their traffic is coming from. An example would be for me to post a _URL_2_ link to a Reddit thread linking to a blog post I did.  Over time I can see in my site traffic how many people came to my page direct from that link vs others.",eli5

76x0ex,"Why does the English language have so many weird inconsistencies? Like 'i before e except after c (except in scientists)' and 'Reed, Read, Read and Red'. I'm sure the language is really hard to learn for these reasons, so why did this sort of thing develop?","So far, /u/Brainix, /u/edups-401, /u/kouhoutek, /u/ABearWrestledMeOnce and /u/F8G9 have all repeated the old myth that this is due to the fact that English has borrowed from many different languages. While is is true that English has borrowed from many different languages, this is not unusual for a language and it doesn't fully explain the spelling inconsistencies.

One thing to notice is that other languages, such as German, also borrow extensively from other languages, but have remarkably consistent spelling. Only the most recent words that have come into the language (usually from English and occasionally French) over about the last 50 or 100 years break this rule. Meanwhile, the French language, which prides itself (somewhat inaccurately) for being ""pure"", has a spelling system that is almost as confusing as English.

Languages always change over time, and the way we pronounce our words changes slowly. In about the year 1400, people spelled words the way they sounded to them, regardless of whether they came from Anglo-Saxon (""cou"" for ""cow"") or Norman French (""beof"" for ""beef"").

Of course, this meant that people speaking different dialects often spelled words in different ways. It was the increasing use of printing that helped put a stop to that: printing meant that books could be mass-produced and copies sent all over the country, so writers and printers started spelling words in ways that could be understood by people speaking different dialects. Over time, this helped to standardize English spelling.

Then came the dictionary compilers (including Samuel Johnson, who wasn't the first, but he was the most famous), and they were a bit too well-educated for their own good. They took some really stupid decisions, such as taking the word ""dette"" and respelling it ""debt"" for no reason other than the Latin word was ""debitus"". They weren't even very consistent with their decisions: they made us spell ""deign"" with a silent ""g"" because it comes from Old French ""deignier"", but allowed us to continue writing ""disdain"" despite the fact that it came from the same root.

Meanwhile, the language was continuing to change. Nearly all of our long vowels changed beyond all recognition (this is why English long vowels are so radically different from the long vowels of other European languages), and many vowel sounds merged: ""see"" and ""sea"" were originally pronounced slightly differently (and neither was pronounced in the modern fashion). But they're still spelled differently because by now writers and dictionary compilers were insisting on keeping the traditional spellings.

In short, English has never had a proper spelling reform since the invention of printing. As time went by, our spellings fell further and further out of step with our pronunciations.

The changes in the vowel system is called the ""Great Vowel Shift"" and took hundreds of years to complete. We also had some changes in the consonants, with some falling silent completely -- but we still write them (French suffers a similar problem).

Simply saying it's because English has borrowed from many languages doesn't even begin to explain how we arrived at where we are. That certainly had some influence, but the biggest reason is that we continue to insist on traditional spellings long after they have become hopelessly inaccurate.

Unfortunately, it's got to the stage now that it would be impossible to fix. By way of private amusement, I have come up with some ideas for spelling reform, but it will never happen. English is now so widespread, it would need the cooperation not only of every officially English-speaking country in the world, but every country where English is used, and that's most of them these days: if a French businessman meets a Japanese business partner, they'll probably speak English. Imagine all the signs that would need to be rewritten, all the books that would need to be republished, all the websites that would need to be changed.

And with this comes the problem of different dialects. Do you pronounce ""herb"" with an ""h"" sound (as the British do) or without (as the Americans do)? Do you rhyme ""shone"" with ""gone"" or with ""bone""? Does ""schedule"" begin with a ""sh"" sound or with a ""sk"" sound? Do you speak one of those dialects where ""Mary"", ""marry"" and ""merry"" all sound the same, or all different? How about ""cot"" and ""caught""? And so on and so forth.

So really... as crazy as the system is, we're stuck with it.",eli5

People sometimes prefer to invalidate whatever made them agree with the disliked person because it's less of an effort than changing your mind about someone you don't like.

Also, if you've decided for any reason that ""person X is bad"", you can set yourself up so that anything X does or thinks *has* to be bad, by judging the actions/thoughts based on who performed them, instead of judging the actions or thoughts independently. That's also a mechanism to keep things consistent and make decision-making about a person ""easy"".

bdxm2z,"Why is an orgasm such an intense, pleasant feeling?","The brain (and consciousness) has evolved to be a sort of feedback system that has helped to improve the success of an organism/species as a whole. 

Imagine the brain as the principal of a school. The students perform there work, either poorly or well. This is analogous to an organism doing something, either helpful or not. The teachers (or certain receptor types) “appraise” the students work and report it to the principal. The principal uses this information to decide how to do its job; if a student is struggling (ie. a behavior is unhelpful/harmful to an organism) the principal will “try something new”. Perhaps the principal will talk to the student and identify the source of the issue and figure out what s(he) can change to improve the student’s performance. Similarly, the brain processes information about a harmful act and sends signals that are perceived as pain. This motivates an organism to change what it is doing and try something else. 

Something like having an orgasm would be extremely helpful in passing the genes on to the next generation so the brain has evolved (over a long period of time) to release large amounts of dopamine (the reward neurotransmitter) when an organism does it. 

For your question about if someone was “wired wrong” if they could feel the opposite; this would be incredibly unlikely to occur. The DNA that encodes an organism is very precise. In order for someone to develop with their nerves “hooked up to the wrong sources” (for lack of a better explanation) there would have to be MAJOR mutations of the DNA. If this were to occur, there would almost certainly be many other regions of the genome that would be completely destroyed and the organism would be non-viable.",eli5

In china, another revolution also took place, which led to killings of intellectuals and basically anyone who didnt like the communists. Huge famines were helped by government suck.

I made a cup of tea but sadly I forgot about it and it went cold. I remember my cup of tea but it was too late, all heat had left it and it was a shell of it's former steaming self.

I decided instead of drinking it cold or wasting it that I would just pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds.

Once I heard the familiar ping of the microwave I grew excited at the idea of drinking some rad warm tea. But when I took the cup out of the microwave it was bubbling (Which was something I'd never seen while doing this.) I thought nothing of it and put a metal spoon in the cup to give it a quick stir, but as soon as I put the spoon in the tea frothed up like a bottle of coke that'd just been shook up and opened. The frothing stopped as abruptly as it started and left me feeling a little confused. 

What do I do guys? Is this really going to be okay to drink?

I'd love it if someone could tell me why this happened and if it's all okay because I don't trust my microwave at the moment and I refuse to let this tea go cold again. :c","it's been superheated.  microwaves excite water particles so if you microwave water too long, after you take it out it can appear normal, but as soon as you break the surface tension it can explode.  it happens because of non uniform heating and the water molecules under the surface are contained by the water/surface tension.

by seeing bubbles after microwaving, you'd probably superheated a lot.

BMW, Audi and Mercedes-benz (the three manufacturers who created the agreement in the first place) are all German car manufacturers; a country without speed limit on most highways (*Autobahn* in German). The agreement exists to reduce the risks of fatal collisions, according to the car manufacturers.

If you imagine a standard person — say six feet tall, 180 pounds — and scale that person down by a factor of two, how tall will that person be? Three feet, obviously, because he's half as big as he was.

But how much will he weigh? If you guessed 90 pounds, you'd be wrong. The answer isn't *half* of the guy's original body weight, but *one eighth* of it, or just twenty two and a half pounds.

In the interest of equal opportunities for everyone, the government introduced federal student loans in the 60's.  The program has been expanding - and loan sizes increasing - ever since.

bk1ji0,"Plain Geek yogurt - if the bacteria feeds on sugar, and the whey is strained, why is the sugar content still relatively high (compared to plain milk)? Many plain, no-sugar-added commercial Greek yogurts have a sugar content of 8 or 9 grams. How is that possible when the bacteria has already fed on the sugar and the whey (which contains a lot of the lactose) has been strained out?","(Amateur yogurt maker here) The bacteria do indeed use up some of the sugar. A higher temperature incubation period is where you get the tastiest fermentation products. But this certainly does not use up all of the sugar. The longer you let it ferment, the less sugar there is, and the more fermented it is (which tends to give it a bolder taste and a firmer texture). The solidification is from acid (a fermentation product) denaturation of protein in the milk. More acid = more denaturation = firmer. 

Most yogurts you buy in the store are fairly ""mild"" yogurts, and are stopped early in the process. The consistency is often then gained from additives which help it retain a more solid texture. You're right that more lactose is in the whey, but far from all of it. 

I personally like very bitter yogurt, which I've not found in the store.

Edit: I guess to more broadly answer... there's a ton of sugar in milk. Bacteria can do a lot with it. But fermentation produces a ton of harmful (to the bacteria) byproducts which prevent the bacteria from being able to use up all the sugar. If you incubate the yogurt in the presence of oxygen, you can rapidly/efficiently use up the sugar, but you will not get a fermented product and it will not be as safe to consume. By restricting oxygen, you get the fermentation products that inhibit the growth of microbes but also limits their ability to continue using up the resources.",eli5

238n4y,"Why do we change our heating/cooling inside our homes? 65° during the summer feels great, but it is freezing in the winter. I am not talking about when we first enter the room, but rather being stuck inside the house for hours.","Radiation.  There are two types of heat transfer at work here: convection and radiation.  Convection is heat transfer via a moving fluid (literally conductive advection).  When you change the thermostat setting, you are changing the temperature of the air and therefore the heat transfer between you and the air.

However, all matter hotter than absolute zero emits energy as radiation, with hotter things emitting more radiation.  All matter is also constantly absorbing radiation that was emitted by other matter and it can be thought of as heat exchange between two samples of matter.

So what does that mean?  Well, you are constantly exchanging radiation with the walls of your house.  The outside temperature will change the temperature of your walls, even with the heat or AC running.  This is especially noticeable in concrete or cinderblock buildings; even if the room is comfortable, if you touch the wall during winter it will feel very cold.  So in the summer the walls are hotter and therefore radiating more heat than in the winter, but your body is a constant temperature and radiating a constant amount.

Put it all together, there is a certain amount of net heat transfer that is comfortable (i.e., perceived as a comfortable temperature).  That certain amount is a combination of convection with the air and radiation with the walls.  In winter, the radiation is lower, so you increase air temperature to compensate.  In summer, the radiation is higher, so you decrease air temperature to compensate.

4umlsg,Why do things appear the color they are? A question of cause and affect. What is it about objects that affects the light that reflects off of it the way it does and what affect does it have on the light that give it color? I'd also like to know how light titillates the retina.,"An object's physical and molecular structure determines how and what light reflects off, refracts through, or is absorbed by it. It is extremely complicated what *exact* physical mechanisms are involved but it involves a deep understanding of physics and chemistry.

The cells in your retina react to specific wavelengths (energy levels) of light. When they detect that wavelength, they activate and send a signal to your brain.

All red objects, for example, happen to reflect light of the ""red"" wavelength so we detect them as red.

We only have three color-detecting cells in our eyes, so we only detect the levels of red, green, and blue light. Using those three detectors, we can actually detect many in-between colors. For example, yellow light has a wavelength between that of red and green (think of the rainbow: ROYGBIV) so the red cells activate a little bit and the green cells activate a little bit. So when our cells report weak levels of both red and green, we detect that as yellow.

Interestingly, this can trick our eyes. For example, we absolutely cannot tell the difference between purely yellow light, and a mixture of both red and green light that stimulates those retinal cells in the same way.

This means that some yellow things actually reflect different light from others, since some reflect both distinct red and green light, while while others reflect purely yellow light (although I suspect most things that reflect light typically will do so in a particular band of wavelengths most strongly, not two separate bands - but light color mixing is how your monitor displays yellow to you, by shining both red and green light at you at once!)

This is also why pink (magenta, not light red) doesn't actually exist as a wavelength of light - it is just what we sense when both the red and the blue detectors trigger at the same time. No pure wavelength of light can do this since they are on opposite ends of the spectrum!",eli5
1s7nf2,"Why does America still have a Farm bill? ELI5:Why does America still have a Farm bill? I've had a quick look at it, and for a free market economy it seems to impose the complete opposite. 
If someone can provide a more details explanation of what it is and why it continues to be that'd be great.","Well, the United States *doesn't* have a completely free economy. It's more free than many other countries, but there are still a lot of protectionist industries, with the notable ones being Steel and various Agriculture products (especially Sugar).

That said, there are three basic reasons for the Farm bill.

1) Protection for farmers if a drought or storm kills the crop or cattle. This would wipe out the farmer/rancher, and prevent him from using his skilled expertise (Industrial farming can be considered skilled labor) in subsequent years to grow food as he is bankrupt/can't get a loan. That's not to say the government swoops in and completely pulls the farmer back on his feet, but the government does offer a stretched out hand. 

2) Provides subsidies for a farmer so he can afford to leave some land fallow (unplanted) for a period of time. This preserves and builds up nutrients in the soil, which is necessary even in this age of chemical fertilizers. Otherwise, the farmer has an incentive to maximize his profit by planting all his fields all his time, which would wear out the soil even with soil saving techniques such as crop rotatoins. 

3) The government essentially subsidizes many articles of food for the farmer to make it profitable for him (fertilizer/GMO crops can be expensive, etc) to grow it without selling it a high price to the consumer. Lower prices for consumers = more money spent on other products and services in the economy, especially by the lower economic classes. 

There are also downsides. For example, Refined Sugar in the US is more expensive than in other parts of the world because we're very protectionist of our sugar industry. This causes higher sugar prices than if we allowed free trade.",eli5

2sl8ob,"Why do tractor trailer trucks need 18 large wheels, but very large planes only need 6 small ones? ","Trucks drive a lot of miles and weigh a whole lot, so their weight needs to be distributed.  Otherwise they're causing a lot of wear on the pavement.  Virtually all wear and tear on highways is caused by trucks, so spreading out the load is very important. Planes only ""drive"" a short distance on pavement, so there's less infrastructure being damaged by having the load more concentrated.  

Additionally, putting more tires on a truck is fairly cheap (you have a nice rigid frame to bolt the axles to) and can make the truck safer (losing one tire out of 18 is relatively minor; losing one out of 6 is a bigger deal).  By comparison, putting more tires on a plane means that you increase the weight by quite a bit.  Losing a tire on landing is pretty inconvenient, but there aren't other planes out there that you're going to hit if you get a flat, so the safety issue is less present.

Then you look at the life of tires on trucks versus planes.  A truck is looking to drive thousands of miles before they have to replace their tires, so you want to have lots of tires to reduce the wear and spread the load.  A plane would ideally like to do a couple hundred landings on a set of tires, which is likely under 1000 miles all told; some planes may only do 10 landings on a set of tires (looking at you, SR-71).  It's OK to have to replace tires all the time on a plane since carrying around more tires would cost even more.

Finally, note that while planes are larger than trucks they aren't *that* much heavier.  A truck may be 100,000 pounds, all told, while a 737 (6-wheeled aircraft) maxes out at about 150,000.  Meanwhile, *very* large planes like the 747 have far more wheels—18 for that model.  The C-5 Galaxy has 28 wheels.  The An-225 has a whopping 32 wheels.",eli5

I'm looking for an explanation as to how come I can feel full while eating one dish or type of food, but then discover I have room to eat something entirely different. It doesn't even have to be a ""traditionally"" filling meal. For example, maybe I'll be eating a big salad and after a while, I'll feel like I can't possibly have another bite of it; however, I'd really like some gummy bears or jelly beans.

Maybe I'm crazy?","No your not. It's quite a common effect in people. Have you ever heard the term ""There's always room for dessert""? :)

The part of your brain that tells you that you are full is called the hypothalamus. There is a condition called Prader-Willi syndrome that causes this part of the brain not to function correctly and thus people with this condition never feel full and can eat themselves to death. Often they have to be strictly controlled and cared for as they can be known to eat non food items if they can't get hold of actual food.

Now in normal folks, the hypothalamus can be ""tricked"" to a certain extent. After you have eaten a large amount of food that triggers the hypothalamus to tell your brain you are full, it can be tricked by switching to a different food type. In normal people this only works so far and there will come a point where this no longer works. For example eating a large steak can make you feel full but then switching to ice cream can trick it and your able to eat it, but only so much before you feel full again.",eli5

b3ps7k,"Why does a temperature of 40F (5C) feel so much warmer leading into spring, compared to the same temp leading into winter ","It's really just physics so I'll ELI10 :D

 & #x200B;

How cold the air feels in simple physics.  First lets understand this mechanic.  When cold air touches your body your body heats that air up and you have a ever so small boundary layer of warmed air around your body.  We use jackets and pants and gloves and hats and your body's own hairs to capture this boundary layer of heated air to keep us warm.

The other important thing we need to understand with this mechanism is that there is both water vapor and ""air"" in the atmosphere.  It takes about 2x's as much energy to heat up water vapor as it does plain dry air.  So if you took a balloon of water vapor and and a balloon filled with dry air both at the exact same temperature and you injected the same amount of heat energy into each balloon, the dry air balloon would be almost twice as hot as the water vapor filled balloon at the end of this experiment.

How much water the air can hold depends on it's temperature. The colder the air the less water the air can hold.  Imagine you have a sponge.  The air temperature is how hard we squeeze the sponge.  Lower the air temperature really cold and you squeeze the sponge really hard and squeeze out all of the water.  Raise the air temperature and you let go of the sponge so it can suck in any water it comes in contact with.

The biggest difference between the two scenarios is that in Case #1 we have super cold below freezing air that we heat up to 40F and in case #2 we have warm air we cool down to 40F.

So the super cold air that warms up in scenario #1 has had all the water wrung out of the air, then as we warm the air we let go of the sponge a little bit.  Now the sponge has been wrung out and  is super dry and has very little water in it.  In case #2 we start with warmer air so we let go of the sponge which is now spends the day soaking up all the water it can.  Then we lower the temperature and now we might squeeze the sponge a little bit but not all the way.  Because our sponge spent all day soaking up water now it is super saturated.

Now in case #1 the air is 40F but is super dry. Our body uses some energy to heat the air up in our boundary layer.  But in case #2 even though the air is at 40C the air is super moist and is filled with water vapor.  Now our body has to put out a lot more heat energy to heat the boundary layer of air around us.  And that's the physics of why it it feels colder in the fall than the spring.",eli5

Latex allergies are usually caused by the person being overexposed to latex from an early age, while peanut allergies for example have been said to be caused by not enough exposure when young. ","The reason for both allergies occur is actually the same: the immune system fails to recognize a substance as ""safe"".  The part of a substance the body recognizes is called an **antigen**.  Different types of immune cells mediate the process which can change the response, this is why peanut allergies often induce anaphylaxis and latex allergies commonly lead to skin irritation.

So why the idea of ""not enough exposure""?  The key here is failure to develop **[oral immune tolerance](_URL_1_)**.  When you are young there is a window of time where your immune system interacts with the environment and gets to decide which antigens are safe and which aren't.  In the case of potential antigens in peanuts, [a little is good but none or too much can potentially cause an allergy](_URL_0_).

The reason for this aberrant reaction is because under normal circumstances if you body receives just a little exposure it has the chance to flag an antigen as ""safe"".  If it never gets this chance it may decide later after an initial window of tolerance development that an otherwise ""safe"" antigen is dangerous.  This is a reason why infants put everything in their mouths.  Failure to develop tolerance is also the cornerstone of the [hygiene hypothesis](_URL_2_).",eli5

8ggszo,Why do they roll out the curtains when the film is about to start but not during the trailers ,"Assuming you are referring to a cinema.

This may be slightly out of date as I was a projectionist over 10 years ago, before the switch over to digital. I worked with 35mm film, but the primary reason will likely still be the same.

So, the main reason is simply that in most cases adverts and trailers are filmed in an aspect ratio of 4:3. This means 4 units of measurement horizontally for every 3 units vertically, or if we divide both sides by 3 (you will see why in a moment), we get a ratio of 1.33333:1.

The feature film on the other hand is often in 2.36:1 aspect ratio (2.36 units horizontally for every 1 unit vertically). Compare this to the ratio on the trailers (1.3333:1 after the divide by 3 to make the right hand value the same for easy comparison) and you see that the film is wider (2.36 vs 1.333 units horizontally for every 1 unit vertically). This means you need to make the screen wider for the film, hence they open the curtains.

EDIT: Should also say that while the curtains could be left open wide for the trailers, in the days of film you would find a very fuzzy edge on the left and right if you did that. The curtains provide a hard line by absorbing the light of the edges of the film, so adjusting the curtains in and out to match the aspect ratio makes a much cleaner edge and looks more professional.

Note that much of this likely does not happen with digital (fuzzy edges etc), but the hardware and the automation is likely still in place from the 35mm days and simply works in the same way. Brand new cinemas built in the last few years which are all digital from the start may do things slightly differently.

In theory you could also do this by raising the curtains up or down vertically to provide the same ratio, but you make the screen smaller by doing this. As most people would object to the film being smaller than the trailers, they increase the width by opening the curtains.",eli5

bqx98d,Why doesn’t the water in lakes and rivers get absorbed into the ground? ,"Some do lose water due to seepage. They lose more or less depending on what kind of rock and sediment lies beneath the lake. A rocky bottom holds water better than a sandy bottom.

Lakes are also subject to evaporation from their surfaces – especially in a dry places – for example, the American West.

So why don’t lakes just dry up? Some do. For a lake to keep its water over time, it has to be replenished. There are both natural and man-made lakes. The main way that water gets into reservoirs and man-made lakes is from the rivers and streams that were dammed to create them. Like man-made reservoirs and lakes, natural lakes may also be replenished by rivers and streams.

Natural lakes have another advantage, when it come to holding their water. They tend to form in the lowest elevations in a given area. So these sorts of lakes may also get underground water that flows in from underneath the lake – the lake floor may be an area of water input, rather than a drain for the lake.",eli5

6m5w23,"Why is it that when you pour liquids out of a smaller opening (like from a jug of milk), then the liquid sputters out instead of flowing evenly and consistently? ","The flowing liquid obstructs the outlet and prevents air from flowing in.  A suction quickly builds up on the inside, preventing further fluid leaving.  For really small openings the flow remains stopped and the container can't empty.  With larger openings air bubbles find a way inside and flow can continue for a short while until there's a need for another air bubble.  This results in the familiar glug-glug-glug cycle as the outward flow of liquid alternates with the inward flow of air.

How big a hole is big enough for the flow to be stopped?  It depends on the viscosity of the liquid.  Pouring less aggressively so that the liquid flow doesn't fully block the outlet can be faster.

Another trick is to swirl the liquid a little as it flows out.  The centrifugal force causes the liquid to flow out around the rim of the outlet, leaving a hole in the middle for air to flow inwards.  The continuous flow of air in and liquid out is faster than with stop-start glugging flows.  Over-doing the swirl slows down the flow, especially at the end so I find it helps to at least slow the rate of swirl once the container is nearly empty.",eli5

Air and sea water are both clear, but because only blue lights are passed through so the sky and the ocean appear blue to us. Green eyes have a very thin layer of pigment on top of the iris, it's so thin that it's yellow instead of brown. Yellow combined with blue will make green. 

Notice how the sky or the ocean change color under certain weather conditions or lights? Blue eyes sometimes change color the same way. When you get older more pigments may appear, like many blond children end up with much darker hair as adults, eyes can get more pigments as well.",eli5

1way9j,"Why are teens who commit murders tried as adults, but when a teen has sex with someone who's 30 courts act like the teen had no idea what he/she was doing? And for clarification, no I'm not 30 years old and interested in having sex with a teenage girl. This whole idea of trying teens as adults just seem inconsistent to me...

EDIT: I suppose the question has been answered, but I still think the laws/courts are inconsistent with their logic.
_________________________
So I'd like to clarify the question because a few people don't see to grasp it (or they're trolling) and this post became pretty popular.

**For clarification:** Suppose a teen commits murder. It's not unusual for courts to try this teen as an adult. Now, I'm no lawyer but I *think* it's because they assume (s)he knew what (s)he was doing. Okay, I can buy that. However, consider statutory rape - a 30 year old hooks up with a 14 year old. Why don't the courts say, *""Well this 14 year old girl knew what she was doing. She's not dumb. We'll view her as an adult, and hey what do ya know, it's not illegal for adults to have sex,""* instead of viewing her as a victim who is incapable of thinking. There is an inconsistency there.

I'd like to comment on a couple common responses because I'm not really buying 'em.

* A few redditors said something along the lines of ""the law is to deter adults from breaking the law."" So the courts made statutory rape laws to deter people from breaking statutory rape laws? I'm either not understanding this response or it's a circular response that makes no sense and doesn't explain the double standard.

* A few redditors said something along the lines of ""the law is to protect teens because they're not really capable of thinking about the consequences."" Well, if they're not capable of *thinking about consequences,* then how can you say they're capable of thinking about the consequences of murder or [beating the shit out of someone](_URL_0_). Secondly, if the concern is that the teen will simply regret their decision, regretting sex isn't something unique to teenagers. Shit. Ya can't save everyone from their shitty decisions... 

* A few redditors have said that the two instances are not comparable because one is murder and the other is simply sex. This really sidesteps the inconsistency. There is intent behind one act and possibly intent behind the other. That's the point. Plus, I just provided a link of someone who was tried as an adult even though they only beat the shit out of someone.

Look, the point is on one hand we have ""this teen is capable of thinking about the consequences, so he should be tried as an adult"" and on the other we have ""this teen is not capable of thinking about the consequences, so they are a blameless victim."" 

Plain ol' rape is already illegal. If a 14 year old *doesn't* want to take a pounding from a 30 year old, there's no need for an extra law to convict the guy. However, if a 14 year old *does* want the D, which was hardly a stretch when I was in school and *definitely* isn't today, then I don't see why you wouldn't treat this teen like an adult since they'd be tried as an adult for certain crimes.
_________________________
EDIT: So a lot of people are missing the point entirely and think my post has to do with justifying sex with a minor or are insisting that I personally want to have sex with a minor (fuck you, assholes). Please read [my response](_URL_1_) to one of these comments for further clarification.
_________________________
EDIT: So I figured out the root of my misconception: the phrase ""They knew what they were doing."" I realized this phrase needs context. So I'll explain the difference between the two scenarios with different language:

* We can all agree that if a teenager commits murder, they are *aware in the moment* that they are murdering someone.

* We can all agree that if a teenager is having sex with an adult, they are *aware in the moment* that they are having sex.

*  >  (So if by ""They knew what they were doing"" you mean ""they're aware in the moment"" it's easy to incorrectly perceive an inconsistency in the law)

* A teenager that commits murder generally has *the mental capacity* to understand the consequences of murder. 

* A teenager that has sex has *the mental capacity* to understand many of the superficial consequences of sex - STDs, pregnancy, ""broken heart,"" etc.

* However a teenager has neither *the mental capacity,* *foresight,* nor *experience* to understand that an individual can heavily influence the actions and psychology of another individual through sexual emotions. A teenager is quite literally *vulnerable* to manipulation (even if the adult has no intention of doing so), and THAT'S the difference. A murderous teen isn't really unknowingly putting him or herself into a vulnerable position, but a teenager engaging in sex certainly is doing just that.
 
I believe a lot of comments touched on this, but I haven't seen any that put it so concisely (as far as I have read) Plus, recognizing the ambiguity of ""they knew what they were doing"" was the light bulb that went off in my head. I hope this clears things up with the people who agreed with my initial position.

To those of you who thought I wanted to have sex with teenagers, you're still assholes.","Good question! This question is a common one in criminal law courses, at least in the U.S.

There's a general principle that when a criminal law exists to protect a certain class of people **from the conduct of another,** individuals within that class cannot be guilty of violating that law, nor can they be an accomplice to someone who does.

Statutory rape laws exist to protect the interests and wellbeing of minors. Consequently a minor cannot be criminally culpable for their part in the sex act.

Many jurisdictions also justify it this way: minors are *conclusively presumed* to lack the capacity to consent to a sex act, at least in the context of statutory rape.

I'm not saying it's just or ""right,"" but there you have it. Also, for those of you in law school, this issue (or one like it) will almost certainly come up on your Multistate Bar Exam.

**Edit:** Clarification in **bold.**

**Edit 2:** Oh! You amended your question. I'll expound on my response.

 >  A few redditors said something along the lines of ""the law is to deter adults from breaking the law."" So the courts made statutory rape laws to deter people from breaking statutory rape laws? I'm either not understanding this response or it's a circular response that makes no sense and doesn't explain the double standard.

I don't think the goal is to keep people from breaking the law; it's to keep adults from having sex with minors. Minors are impressionable and generally don't know much about sex or its consequences. Consequently, they can be exploited. Sex is a powerful manipulative tool even among adults. It's not irrational to think that minors are generally more susceptible to that manipulation. That's the reason these laws exist.

 >  Well, if they're not capable of thinking about consequences, then how can you say they're capable of thinking about the consequences of murder or beating the shit out of someone. 

But as a few other redditors have pointed out, we're educated about murder, life, and death from a very early age. By the time you're old enough to make memories, you probably know killing is wrong. Sex, by contrast, is something (most) children are only just learning about as they approach adolescence. So a fifteen-year-old might have a semester of sex ed plus a couple of years of rumors and anecdotes as their education. But for over a decade, people have been telling them that murdering is literally the worst thing they could do. I won't weigh in with my opinion, but this seems like a pretty compelling argument to me.

 >  if a 14 year old does want the D, which was hardly a stretch when I was in school and definitely isn't today, then I don't see why you wouldn't treat this teen like an adult since they'd be tried as an adult for certain crimes.

In short, society thinks that we shouldn't trust the minor with that decision, even today.  Our criminal laws are the product of a lot of conflicting social policies - you're not going to find a consistent, rational justification that pleases everyone.

**Edit 3:** A lot of people have been asking how this principle plays out in recent cases where teens have been charged with distributing child pornography by sending nudes (of themselves) to other teens. Since the comments are getting buried, here's my take:

 >  On one hand, the principle should still stand, but on the other, the government really, really hates CP, and SCOTUS gives the government broad latitude in fighting it.

 >  I would consequently hypothesize that the societal interest in fighting CP could outweigh the policy cited in my aforementioned principle. There's also a distinction between these cases and the statutory rape example - in the situation you've cited, the teen is the primary wrongdoer. They're the one distributing the pornography. By contrast, in the statutory rape example, they're not the one having sex with the minor. They aren't culpable of violating the law itself. They may be an accomplice to the act in theory, but the aforementioned doctrine prohibits that.

 >  For either of these reasons, I could see a court permitting a prosecution in the example you're citing. But depending on the teen's age, it might just be a delinquency charge as opposed to a full blown felony.

And: 

 >  Our child porn laws were conceived long before sexual activity among minors was so prevalent, and long before smartphones.

 >  The rule I cited above is a rule of statutory construction - it looks at the legislature's intent at the time the law was written. Naturally, when a law was created decades before such a major cultural shift, the purpose of the rule is confounded.

In other words, this is a bleeding-edge legal issue. Prosecutors are apparently using CP laws to combat an issue that I highly doubt any legislature contemplated 15+ years ago.

You need to go through that same process to buy ammunition, and also include proof that you legally own the weapon you are buying ammunition for. You cannot buy ammunition for guns you do not own or don't have a license to own. 

You cannot openly carry your weapon outdoors or in public, even if it's unloaded. Exceptions are made to hunters with a valid hunting and weapon permit, historical reenactments, or shooting competitions.

Such permits require you to have a plausible need to carry the firearm, and pass an exam covering weapon handling and knowledge of gun laws.

bqqjhw,why do computers use RGB rather than RYB to make all the colors? ,"Because red, yellow, and blue aren't the primary colours of light.

Our eyes detect basically three wavelengths of light: red, green (slightly more on the yellow side of green, but still green), and blue.  All the light that we can see is caused by the three types of cells responding to those three colours of light.  If the light is bright yellow, then both the red and the green detecting cells will react, since it's close enough to their detection that they activate but don't activate as strongly as if it was red light or green light.

Red (actually, magenta), yellow, and blue (actually cyan) are the primary *pigment* colours, because each absorbs a single colour of those three, so that mixing them produces a new colour. For example, magenta light absorbs green light but reflects red and blue light.  Meanwhile, yellow absorbs blue light and reflects red and green light.  If you mix yellow pigment and magenta pigment together, you end up with something that absorbs both blue and green light, which means it only reflects red light, so it appears red.",eli5

258xhq,How did people tell time before a 24 hour clock system was established? Considering how days in summer are 18 hours and in winter are like 11 hours.,"Amazing how everyone authoritatively claims people didn't care about time before the invention of clocks. How do you know?

The system of dividing the day into 12 hours and the night into 12 hours and dividing hours into 60 minutes of 60 seconds each apparently was devised in ancient Sumeria. The reason is because the Sumerians used a base 12 number system instead of a base 10 system like we use. So 12 and 60 are ""round"" numbers in their system just like 10 and 50 are in ours.

That was so long ago that I think it's safe to say we really don't know much about what people did about time before that. Writing was first invented in ancient Sumeria so of course, we have no written records from earlier times.

Also, days in summer are not 18 hours everywhere on Earth. Close to the equator, like in Sumeria, there is not much seasonal variation.",eli5

Hi there, I'm asking as someone who knows nothing of the military and is generally curious after always hearing about how tough life is for veterans, so kind of like a five year old. I hear them in news stories about homelessness and drug abuse. What exactly happens when you join the military? I always hear about how they'll pay for school or they generally pay pretty decent money, but what happens when you're ""discharged""? Does the support completely stop after that? Seems like they should get better life-time support than anyone else I can think of, but I guess that's how it is... Thanks! ","Veterans are only given a pension if they serve for 20 years or more.  But military life is pretty tough, so most vets don't make it a career, and end up getting out after a tour or two.

If you don't retire, there's basically zero support.  You get your GI Bill money for school, and you can possibly get some health care and disability pay from the VA if you can prove that whatever health problems you have were caused by military service (which is difficult at best), but basically if you don't retire, it's just like quitting any other job.",eli5

47isnn,why do fully grown adults think that Facebook images with text on them are 100% factual?,"Because since the invention of the printing press, mass media was controlled by ""the authorities."" Everything you saw in writing was written or approved by the cultural or political elites, and if it wasn't factual, was at least what you were supposed to believe and say.

Only in the last 10-20 years have we come up with this system of communication that lets any moron in the world post whatever they want online and share it with millions of people. We have hundreds of years of cultural conditioning that if you see something written down like a fact, it's probably a fact, and it doesn't just immediately go away, especially if you're an adult and for most of your life it was a safe assumption. 

Add to this that normal fully grown adults don't just spend their days creating inaccurate internet memes. So the notion that there's just someone out their creating content that is deliberately misleading doesn't always occur to them.

Last, most people, even fully grown adults, have terrible critical thinking skills. The public education systems in western society are geared around teaching you to read, memorize, and recall facts. Most people are never really encouraged to think for themselves, don't do it very often, and are consequently pretty bad at it.

What mechanism moves the chain to a larger/ smaller gear? ,"If you take a look at your bike, you'll see cables snaking from the switches on the handlebars down to each set of gears -- specifically, to a little thing attached to each set called a *derailleur.*

Assuming a mechanical derailleur (there are some that use motors to achieve the same effect), pushing the button causes the cable to either release or take up more slack; that slack (or lack thereof) causes the derailleur to slide from side to side. This, combined with the physical act of pedaling, causes the derailleur to nudge the chain until it either falls off the gear, or slides up onto the larger gear.",eli5

9hn0j8,"Why can cars get towed so easily? Don't parking brakes and steering wheel locks stop that kind of thing? I always see video of cars just getting towed away, but doesn't that cause some sort of damage to the car?","For the last half, there’s ways around things like that. Did a tow-away of an abandoned car.. front wheel drive but parking brake was on and didn’t have the keys. So I got into the car using my regular lockout tools, alarm went off but simply popped the hood and disconnected the battery then took the brake off and away I went. But mainly tow truck operators can lift the drive wheels off the ground with our wheel underlifts as usual and go. That’s with either the method I above, getting lucky and the brake already off, or we’re picking up a rear wheel drive car from the rear. 

If the steering is locked up sideways for example, and this also applies to 4x4/awd vehicles, either end can be picked up, then the remaining end put on dollies(those twin sets of 2 wheels you generally see on either side of a tow truck). 


TL;DR If time is a factor, either end of the vehicle can be picked up with the wheel underlift, and the opposite end put on dollies if that’s the case. 



That said, in some cases I would imagine the hardcore repo folk or those working in a rough neighbourhood for example.. the aim of the game is to just get the car away from its location safely and with minimal(if any) confrontation with the vehicle owner. Minor damage getting it from where it’s parked, to some side street out of sight in order to do the ideas listed above for example.. may be irrelevant but of course that’s circumstantial and/or at the discretion of the truck driver.",eli5

Your hands, when wet, are incredibly humid (100%), whereas the air around them is decidedly less so (5-30% depending on where you are). When you sweat and it evaporates it is because of two things; the first is that you are heating the sweat on your skin, and the second is that your skin is more humid than the air around it. This creates ideal conditions for heat to enter the sweat, then to leave your skin in the evaporated sweat. The same idea applies here. Heat is entering the water on your hands, and then being removed by the drier. So even though the air is warm the heat in your hands is being pulled out of them giving the sensation of being cold.",eli5

When they consume these carbohydrates, they produce acids which decay your teeth. When a person dies, the gravy train of carbohydrates stops and the bacteria colonies die.

6zkhdj,"Why do most STDs spread via sexual intercourse and not through other actions like making out? EDIT: Okay, I should clarify. I understand what STD stands for, I'm asking what exactly causes them to spread. Is the disease in the sexual fluids? If so, then do they spread if it's swallowed? Do they spread because the fluids get into the blood stream through genitalia acting as a semipermeable membrane and soaking up the fluids? Do they spread because they're being transferred directly into genitalia? Is it harder for males to get STDs because the fluids have to go through the urethra or is the urethra just as susceptible to intaking diseased fluids as a vagina? It would seem to me like the urethra is less susceptible because it's not a direct entry point into the body, even urinating afterward I feel like would cleanse it and dramatically reduce the chance of diseased fluids getting all the way ""upstream"" per se. 

I'm curious, what it is about STDs that causes them to spread via sex and not other means (like making out). Is it mostly because of fluids that are excreted during orgasm? I feel like it would be harder for men to contract STDs as well since the fluids have a bit of a distance to go up the urethra if that's how it works. Can you contract STDs if no fluid excretion was involved, and again, how? Would it be from the skin absorbing the fluids?","There's different answers for STDs, so I'll take you through each one. The major STDs are: Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphilis, Herpes, HPV (genital warts) and HIV. 

1. Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by the microbe Neisseria Gonorrhoeae. This microbe has a predilection for infecting epithelial cells (such as those found in the urethra). It is actually able to both attach to the cell lining as well as to invade cells and live inside them. It is spread through sexual secretions (semen, vaginal secretions) when cells slough off into the secretions. It is completely possible to get gonorrhea in your throat, and is actually more common than you might think. It causes an infection that presents somewhat similar to strep throat. 

2. Chlamydia: Chlamydia is also a bacterial infection caused by the microbe Chlamydia Trachomatis. Just like Gonorrhea, it is able to invade cells, but chlamydia can only live inside cells (similar to a virus). It is spread the exact same way as gonorrhea, and can also infect the throat. However, Chlamydia tends to present with a cough as well as conjunctivitis (eye inflammation). 

3. Syphilis is another bacterial infection caused by the microbe Treponema Pallidum. It has a complex pathogenesis and life cycle and initial infection results in a chancre (a large painless ulcer, beware when googling images of this). It then enters the blood and lymphatics and disseminates throughout the body where it lies dormant for a while. Syphilis is spread by blood and bodily secretions (not saliva, due to unclear reasons, likely due to the presence of antibacterial substances). Syphilis can also be transmitted by oral sex, however it doesn't typically affect the throat. It tends to form a chancer on the lips or on the inside of the cheek. 

4. Herpes is a virus that is spread by direct contact. It can appear almost anywhere on the body, but is most common on the lips and genitals. 

5. HPV (human papilloma virus) is a virus that, like Herpes, is spread by direct contact. Only 6-10 strains (out of hundreds) actually cause symptoms-some strains cause warts, others are linked to cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against the strains most associated with warts and cancer. 

6. HIV is a virus that is spread in blood and bodily fluids (again, not saliva). It is only infectious if it is able to enter through and open wound and get into the blood. Anal sex inherently creates numerous microtears in the rectum, and thus increases the risk of HIV transmission (this is why homosexual practices are associated with higher levels of HIV transmission and thus why HIV was once considered a disease of gay men). It is theoretically possible to get HIV from oral sex, however I am not aware of any actual confirmed cases of this. HIV is destroyed by stomach acid, so it would have to infect its host prior to entering the stomach. 

There are other STDs, but these are the most well known ones.",eli5

4lso99,Why do we get normal pimples and occasional ingrown hairs with proper hygiene but I see all of these native or third world people on television who aren't being consumed by skin infection?,"This question invites a fair bit of speculation so I'll throw in my 2 cents. Soap, hygiene and your environment. The western world has been battling germs for a very long time and our bathing habits suit our lifestyles, but we shower and bath more than at any other time in history. We also do it with antibacterial soap, and a range of personal hygiene products all designed to keep us clean and kill bacteria and fungus. 

Still with me? Human beings shed millions of skin cells a day. It makes up a fair bit of the dust in your home, the stuff in your keyboard, etc. We also release oils and waxes in our sweat which can plug up our pores. 

Now imagine life without bathing. You would get dirty up to a point and body odor would be pretty strong, but at a certain point the bacteria and yeast colonies on your skin would stabilize and they would start acting like a shield to prevent nuisance strains from infecting your skin including your pores. They would also break down the oils, lipids, and other stuff that our skin oozes, and our skin wouldn't be so dry and prone to cracking. 

So people who do not bathe as much, and are in environments that aren't so sterile have a jungle of flora and fauna on their skin that prevents infection, and breaks down the skin waste. It's like having natural skin lotion/acne cream/deodorant.",eli5

But skin cancer from sun exposure generally happens late enough in life that it has no impact on someone's ability to reproduce, and if it doesn't affect our ability to reproduce, then there is no evolutionary pressure to change it (i.e. pretty much no one who is more prone to UV-influenced cancer is dying before they can have children).",eli5

I feel if the do the work and make the grade they should have the say chance as those who are coming out of high school.,"Many schools use scholarships as a recruiting tool.  From a business perspective, it doesn't make sense to spend your 'advertising' money on a student who will only attend 2 years when you can hook a student that will end up paying you for 4 years.  This is compounded by the fact that many low-level classes are really cheap to teach because you can have one grad student teach a room full of 100 undergrads, compared to an upper division course that requires a tenured faculty member teaching 10-15 students.

Beyond that, they don't *need* to offer incentives to CC students.  Many CC students that are attending college are adults that have a job and/or family that they need to stay close to (or want to keep living with their parents to continue saving money).  These students are going to attend the college close to home regardless of any incentive a scholarship provides.

Finally, most of the recruiting effort is targeted at the 'traditional', just out of HS students because *they're the majority of students*.  It takes time and money to put together recruiting materials, it makes the most sense to put together a program that targets 90% of students rather than 5%.",eli5
6i3mw6,Neutrino oscillation! How does it work and why does it happen? ,"So before everything, I'm going to make sure we are on the same page on neutrino oscillations. There are three types, or flavors, of neutrinos(the electron, muon, and tau neutrinos), and when they travel in space, they can spontaneously change into one another.

This is actually a pretty complicated topic and will take a bit of explanation. To understand neutrino oscillation you need to understand a bit of how states are represented and how measurements work in quantum mechanics.

In quantum mechanics, we describe things with quantum states, for [example](_URL_0_), this (misinterpretation of) Schrodinger's cat is described by a quantum state. The state is in 'superposition', meaning that it is the addition of an 'alive' state and a 'dead' state.

Quantum mechanical measurements also work a bit differently than what you are probably used to. When you measure whether the cat is alive or dead, there's a 50/50 chance for both. In other words, if you have 1000 Schrodinger's cats, and you measure whether they are alive or not, you would expect 500 alive and 500 dead(there are fluctuations since the process is random, so it doesnt have to be exactly 500, but it will be close).

In addition to the probability, superposition contains another piece of information: the complex phase of each component. Essentially it's a piece of information telling how each component states add together to form the whole thing. Depending on this phase, the states may simply add up, or they may subtract each other, or they may do other things. It's as if each component in the superposition is represented by a guy with a certain height facing a certain direction. The height of the guy is the probability, the direction in which he is facing is the complex phase. If you have two guys(two states in superposition), their relative orientations will change how the states can add/multiply into each other. Note that the changes in the phases alone(direction of guys) doesn't affect the probability measurement(height of the guy).

So to sum up a bit: each component in the superposition has two associated numbers that determine their roles in the whole state: 1) the (square root) of the probability for each component, which determines measurement outcomes for that state 2) the *complex phase* of that component, which determines how the different states can add up and multiply. These two numbers form the so-called 'quantum mechanical amplitude'.

Quantum states also change with time according to the Schrodinger Equation. Just like how in classical physics, particles subjected to forces change their position/velocity/acceleration over time according to Newton's second law f=ma, quantum states also change with time according to the potentials they are subjected to. 

So what happens to neutrinos when they travel?

Well neutrinos can also be described by their flavor states. Neutrinos have 3 flavor states, meaning that when you describe a neutrino with a quantum state, it can be any superposition of the three states, and when you measure their flavors(ie determine what type they are), there are only three possible outcomes. 

Neutrinos also have three mass states, ie we can also describe a neutrino quantum state as a superposition of the mass states(instead of the flavor states, which are different) when we measure their masses(aka energy, because E = mc^2), we will only have three outcomes.

When neutrinos travel in empty space, it is easier to look at the mass states to see how the whole state changes. Since energy/mass is conserved, the probability of each mass state doesn't actually change with time(so if it was a 50/50 superposition of mass 1 and mass 2, the 50/50 probability will remain the same as it travels). HOWEVER, the *complex phase* associated with each mass state oscillates differently.

So what happens with the neutrino quantum state, as represented by a superposition of mass state, is that each mass state component is represented by a spinning guy of constant height. For different components(masses), the guys are spinning at different speeds.

Now here's the crux of how neutrino oscillation happens: **mass states and flavor states are different**, in other words **mass states are themselves superpositions of flavor states**.

To be more exact, each spinning guy carries a mass state, and each mass state is a superposition of flavor states. That means when you group up(add up) the flavor states, each of the flavor states is made up of multiple guys spinning at different speeds 'adding' together. Like I said the direction that each guy faces(the complex phases) actually determines how they are added up. Therefore when you add all the complex phases spinning at different speeds and check the probability of each flavor state, their probabilities actually change with time. [Here](_URL_1_)'s an analogy that my professor used to explain this: if you play two tones at two very close frequencies, you get an alternating(oscillating) loudness. This is similar to what happens when the spinning guys add up! When the spinning guys(spinning at slightly different speeds due to their different mass states) add up, they produce an oscillating quantum mechanical amplitude for each flavor state, corresponding to changes in the probability of each flavor, leading to spontaneously changing neutrino types!

Man this explanation is long(and abstract)! It is a rather technical topic and I imagine you are probably still confused about a bit of how it works. Feel free to ask more questions and I'll see how much more ELI5 is possible!

Source: One of my professors(Professor M.C. Chu from CUHK) is a particle cosmologist and a world-leading expert on neutrino oscillation. His research group set up an experiment in the Daya Bay Nuclear Reactor to measure the neutrino oscillations from the nuclear reactions and provided the world's most accurate measurement on one of the mixing angles(theta-13, a number that says how different the mass states and flavor states are). He is also very good at teaching and gave a lecture about neutrinos two years ago which I thoroughly enjoyed!

As to why those particular tones, likely because they are the tones that appeal to them -- a mother cat calling to her kittens has a high pitch ""chirrup"" sound, and when a cat looks at a bird they tend to make a high pitched ""chatter"" or click.

As a CFO, I oversee the accounting (history) and finance (future) functions.  My primary objective is to ensure the financial decisions of the organization maximize cash flow and minimize risk, which, in turn, maximizes shareholder value.  I do so by understanding and analyzing the company's historical performance (accounting), and use that information to help the company make the best financial decisions in the future (finance).  These come in the form of investing, financing, and operating decisions.  Simply put, what assets do we invest in, do we pay for the assets with debt or equity, and how do we operate those assets as efficiently as possible?  All of these decisions must be put in the framework of cash flow and risk, but must also consider the short-term and long-term impact of the decision.

As for compensation, this is another area where privately-owned companies differ from publicly-owned companies.  However, my compensation is based on my ability to provide information and recommendations that will impact the company favorably.  I believe my value to the organization comes from these recommendations, but also from my ability to take complex financial matters, and simplify them in a way that allows for quick, informed decisions.

Hope that gives you an idea of what a CFO does, but feel free to AMA. 

Oh, and even though I'm a ""C"" executive, I still have to cover up my tattoos like everybody else. :)

TL;DR - A CFO's job is to maximize shareholder value.",eli5

1ye7xl,Why cant endangered/vulnerable animal species like koalas be domesticated to preserve their numbers? ,"Domestication would take generations of breeding, which causes several problems. First, quite a few would have to be taken out of their habitat to find those with traits most suitable for domestic life, which is a problem considering their already small numbers. Second, even if their numbers did grow, domesticated koalas (or other animals) would never be able to live in the wild due to them being naturally reliant on human habitats, so their numbers in the wild would never be helped. That is the main reason we wish to save endangered animals that have been effected by humans, so the habitat doesn't become dangerously unbalanced due to their absence. Also, keep in mind the difference between domesticated animals, like dogs and cats, and tamed animals, like pet monkeys.

The better solution is to use currently captive koalas to breed, and then bring their offspring up in an environment that is close to how they naturally live. However, this has historically been a tough endeavor because we often know relatively little about how and when the offspring of endangered species naturally learn the skills they need to survive in the wild.",eli5

3oem7j,Why does WinRAR never actually require payment? ,"From _URL_1_

 > Winrar is licensed as ""shareware"", the license type is mostly outdated now, but back in the 90's you would see most software marketed as either freeware (free to use), shareware (free to try, pay to use), or just plain paid software. These days we see more software released in the demo/full version form, although some software companies still release shareware (pretty sure Photoshop is still released this way, 30 days full/free, paid after it expires, although it's no longer called ""shareware"") 

 > A lot of shareware was released like Winrar back in the day, where paying for the software was more of an option than a requirement. By not blocking the customer out after 30 days it garners the customers respect and the developer hopes that you'll eventually pay for it, even if you've used it for a year or two. Even if you don't, you'll probably recommend it to a friend and your friend may become a paying customer. 

 > It's basically writing software with the hope that enough customers will pay to make it worthwhile. Winrar probably sticks with this model simply because its worked for them for so long. 

It seems like they base it on honesty and trust. They trust that when you are fully satisfied with their service, and that it meets your requirements, that the customer will pay the fee

1owoil,Why are people upset that CEOs make so much more money than low level workers? ,"It's not so much that CEOs make so much more than regular workers, it's that salaries for CEOs have increased at a much faster rate than regular workers over the past 30 years.  Since probably the 1970's, we've seen a shift in the worker/employer relationship.  Whereas before, there was a certain 'unspoken agreement' between worker and employer that meant the worker would be loyal to the company (put in his 30+ years) and the employer would take care of him by offering a livable wage and benefits.  In the 70's/80's, that started to change.  Obviously, the most visible thing was a lot of companies closed their factories in America and outsourced their production elsewhere.  So the relationship changed.  Now there is a more adversarial relationship between the two. (I acknowledge that it never has been perfectly hunky dory, but now it's worse)

Wages for workers have stagnated since the 80's.  Partially, this is thought to be due to outsourcing.  (Why pay Americans when you can pay foreigners a fraction of the cost).  But, while wages for workers have stagnated, CEO pay has increased dramatically.  While obviously, CEOs provide intangible benefits to companies, it is difficult to accept that these businesses have become so much more efficient over the past 30 years in thanks solely to senior officers.  

And additionally, in the past 15 years, several high profile companies have been found to be committing fraud or other crimes perpetrated by senior officers.  Enron was a big one 13 years ago.  Then, WorldCom and Tyco had big accounting scandals.  Then of course was the banking crisis a couple years back.  This has given corporate officers a bad reputation, as if they are all glad-handing crooks more likely to line their own pockets than try to play the game honestly.  Whether that reputation is well-deserved or not is up for debate, and is beside the point anyway.  The high pay they give themselves is just another example for the general public to believe they are in it solely for themselves.

These are just a couple reasons.",eli5

I was just blown away by how much blood they took to run what I thought were simple tests. Can they not use the same blood for different tests?

Does more volume reduce clotting time?
Is it in case they mess up a test?","You're asking about a lot of different things in your description.

The short answer to your title is that different tests require different amounts of blood that are processed differently depending on the type/color of tube drawn.  A secondary reason is for follow-on testing/re-testing in case of odd results.  

DNA testing is primarily done via PCR, in which a substance is first subjected to various enzymes to isolate the DNA, then that isolated DNA is replicated millions of times - which creates tons of DNA copies to work with for testing purposes. 

Some tests can use blood from the same tube type/color, e.g. clotting time tests (PT/PTT) from a sodium citrate tube (usually light blue top and smaller than other tubes).  Most blood gas testing can be run from a heparin/warfarin tube (usually green top).  Some tubes have serum separators included in the tube, which help filter the blood components when spun through a centrifuge.

We're moving towards testing which can do more tests and more complicated tests with less blood, sure, but not all labs have CDC level capabilities.",eli5
4lfjtt,"Why do some bands hide their drum set behind glass during live shows, like Garbage or The Who, but most bands do not?","It's been many years since the rocker days of my youth, but if I remember correctly, it has to do with better mic control for the drums, and less bleed over to the other mics on stage.  Basically, drums are noisy AF and you want to have as much control of that as possible as part of the total mix.  If to much of the drum sounds get picked up by the mics used on the guitar amps or vocal mics it can make it difficult to get and maintain the proper mix.  Remember, there tend to be a ton of mics on stage.  Not just the ones people are singing into.  I want to say that this was developed originally for mic control in confined spaces like a TV/radio studio where the music can turn into noise real quick if the sound engineer can't control what's going on.

90mwyv,What causes the sensation in your bones when we stretch? ,"I'm not sure what sensation you're referring to.

When cracking joints like fingers or neck and back/vertebra, there is a compression of the fluid in between the space. The result is a popping or cracking sound as the gas is compressed out of the synovial fluid. Like when you pop a balloon. The result of this is a small release of endorphins, which is responsible for the sensation you may feel, as they have analgesic properties. The gas takes time to build up again, which is why you can't crack your knuckles constantly.

When stretching or popping is heard outside of joints, usually it's a tendon (muscle to bone) or ligament (bone to bone) rubbing as it slides. Reductions in tension can alleviate pain. 

TLDR: Gas goes pop when you crack; endorphins release and feel good. Stretching continuously relieves tension, thus alleviating pain.",eli5

7vq3gx,Why do different countries have different netflix selections?,">  Why do different countries have different netflix selections?

The licensing for media is typically divided up by regions. There are many reasons to do this, such as the fact that the entities which are going to be distributing the media are different in each region. A company which serves the United States may not even be part of the Southeast Asia market for example. Another factor is that the purchasing power of regions can vary widely, meaning the potential profit from distributing to the US is going to differ compared to the SE Asia market and therefore the price at which distribution rights can be sold will vary.

By selling different regions of the world separately and with exclusivity the producers of the media can maximize their profits. Being the only company able to distribute a given media in a particular market is valuable, and selling that right to a company which doesn't even serve that market makes zero sense. They would be giving up the ability to sell the exclusive distribution rights to someone else, and the company they sold it to wouldn't be willing to pay extra for the rights either.",eli5

24ph8e,Why is a road bike better on a road than a mountain bike and why does weight matter on a bike? ,"A mountain bike typically has a much higher center of gravity, which makes it unstable at high speeds; a lower top speed, which means the engine has to work harder to maintain main road speeds of 50+ mph (decreasing efficiency and increasing wear/tear); and off-road tires, which don't have as much traction on smooth tarmac and often cause excess vibration, further reducing stability at speed.

Low weight means easier to make sharp, sudden turns, as is often necessary in off-road conditions, as well as making it easier to accelerate and decelerate in low traction environments such as gravel and sand.

1wbmm9,Why can't nuclear power plants use their own generated power for cooling? ,"Nuclear engineer here.

They can, and they do. When a nuclear power plant is online, it actually supplies all its own power. The main generator has taps that feed back into the plant's auxiliary power system.

However, when the reactor has to scram, or when the power grid has an instability, they usually cannot, and here are some of the reasons/issues why:

First up, after a reactor scram, there is insufficient decay heat to drive the generator. So if the reactor has to scram for any reason, you lose the ability to power your own equipment. After a scram, the plant's electrical system will perform an automatic fast transfer from the generator to the plant's reserve transformers to draw in grid power.

Now second up, what about when the plant loses electrical power from the grid? The answer is, a plant CAN power itself and stay online, IF it was designed that way. So for example, during the 2003 Northeast blackout in the US, the blackout was so severe it stretched into parts of Canada. The Canadian CANDU reactors have what is called ""total load reject capability"". In plain terms, this means if the power grid goes away, the plant and its systems are designed to automatically downshift the reactor to  < 50% power, automatically vent excess steam, disconnect from the failed power grid, and continue powering itself. This scenario, a load reject without scram, is a challenging one to design for, and even though all the CANDU plants have this function and tested it, only about 1/2 managed to survive that blackout. The rest had some other system perturbation that produced a reactor scram, leading them to shut down. 

So the next question one would ask, is why don't US plants, or most plants have this functionality? And there are several challenges. You can design for this scenario, but it requires taking penalties to the plant's operating limits and installing more equipment and more expensive equipment from the start. If the reactor downshift does not occur properly, or if one of your systems designed to handle the excess steam fails, you put a large shock on the reactor, so you have to take penalties to your core thermal limits. You also need a generator and a turbine that can handle low load conditions (most large nuclear plant turbine/generator sets are unstable if they can't put out enough power and will vibrate themselves). Low-load capable turbine/generators are usually less efficient. Most plants have been moving to new/modern turbine designs like the mono block rotors, which do not like being at load electrical outputs for more than a few hours. After 2-4 hours my plant's mono-block turbine will start to vibrate excessively and we have to trip it. If my plant was capable of running itself with no power grid, that means we would be fundamentally limited to 2-4 hours without the grid. 

The next challenge is load reject capability. A ""Load Reject"", is when the grid stops accepting electrical power. This is the equivalent of pedaling your bike up the hill and the chain snaps, and you lose balance and fall over, except you are dealing with dozens of tons of rapidly rotating metal. It is hard to design for. You also have issues on the reactor side. At the time the offsite power grid goes away, the reactor is producing 14 million pounds of steam per hour (for a large 1000MW plant). When the power grid goes away, the turbine isn't capable of accepting that much steam. The plant needs a place to put all this excess steam while it attempts to rapidly reduce reactor power, otherwise there will be a massive pressure shockwave that will challenge the reactor's safety. One way to do this is to signifacntly oversizes the plant condenser, then they can route ALL of the reactor steam there. This is not typical, plants usually only size their condenser to handle 15-35% pure reactor steam. Typically condensers are sized with the idea that the turbine is going to to remove most of the energy from reactor steam. So this is usually a limitation. 

If your condenser is not large enough, some alternative options for PWRs include dumping steam out to the atmosphere. You can only do this for a short time though, because the plant would be venting off clean extremely pure water, and there is a limited supply of that on site under normal conditions. For BWRs, you can dump steam in the pressure suppression pool, but only for about 10 seconds, and it requires special analysis, core penalties, and a license modification to do. In both plant types an automatic partial scram would need to occur to drop power low enough so that the plant can remain online, and if the power grid doesn't come back in time this could cause xenon/fission product/conditioning limits being violated which would require the plant to still shut down. Some overseas PWR/BWR plants DO have oversized condensers, partial scrams, turbine/generators designed for low load, based on my talks with operators from those plants, the reactor typically only stays online 30-50% of the time.

On top of this all, with a shutdown reactor, you only have to deal with  <  1% of reactor heat (Decay heat). Emergency core cooling system is extremely reliable and can deal with this easily/readily. Many operators, including myself, if I was in a situation where I lost the offsite grid, would be reducing reactor power to get the core shutdown so I would have less heat to deal with if/when another plant failure occurred. 

There's one last piece I didnt mention. In the US, every nuclear plant operating license requires the offsite power grid. With the offsite grid lost, there are requirements to have the plant shut down in 12 hours or less.

tl;dr During normal operation nuclear plants power themselves. After a scram they cant (because the core is shutdown). After a loss of power grid, it is very hard and expensive to design a plant to survive that without a reactor scram, and even if you do, you'll probably have a scram 50% of the time anyways or you'll have to come off in 2-4 hours because of other limitations.",eli5

Second, there is a fundamental law of physics that says that deleting information causes an increase in entropy (see [Landaue's principle](_URL_0_)). Since computers delete information *all the time* -- every time they modify a memory cell, they are deleting the previous contents of the memory and replacing it with new information -- the laws of physics require an increase in entropy which manifests as waste heat.

The study of [reversible computation](_URL_1_) is an attempt to work around the latter effect.",eli5

1o19dw,Why do girls have more round and neat handwriting as opposed to boys? ,"As a primary grade teacher with a child development background -

Most children begin to write letters around 5-6 years old. At this point, girls have already begun to develop and refine their fine motor skills. Boys, in general, develop fine motor skills a couple years later than girls do.

This is why, when I teach cursive to 8-9 year olds, the boys' cursive is typically much neater than their print. In fact, I don't see much difference between boys and girls in the early stages of cursive writing.

However, this is where gender does start to play a role. More girls than boys tend to take an interest at this point in improving and individualizing their cursive, while the boys tend to be satisfied with simply achieving proficiency. Note that this is not to say that all girls take the interest in improving, or that no boys do - this is just generalized.",eli5

76749u,Why did the US colonies form separately instead of just one big colony? Most other countries like China or Russia formed as a big single entity so why did the US form multiple colonies which led to multiple states?,"In places like China or Russia, you had one power trying to subjugate the others and establish a form of central authority. The strongest kingdoms conquered their neighbors and established a unified state. (In China, it fell apart several times and was then re-unified.) The history of the colonies in America is different.

In North America, different groups came to the country for different reasons. One difference was national--the governments of Britain, France, Spain and the Netherlands wanted their *own* colonies that would benefit themselves. But especially among British settlers, each colony was also driven by different ideas. Some went to North America to develop prosperous plantations. Some went there to establish a new kind of society. Some wanted to escape war and persecution in Europe. The British crown granted each colony the right to have a limited kind of self-rule. Over time some colonies got merged, and the British conquered a lot of the foreign colonies.

Before the American Revolution, the colonies were still separate, even though they were all British. They built increasingly close relations with each other, for example they organized a joint defense during the French and Indian War. They saw they had a common interest. When they became upset with Britain, they decided to fight for independence together--different states, but all Americans, organized through the Continental Congress. Even after the Revolution it would take many years for people to see themselves as truly united. They developed a constitution that gave some power to a central government, but left most of the power with the states. The Civil War showed that the states were willing to use force to keep the other members a part of the Union. Especially in the 20th century, federal power increased a lot. But even today, people disagree about how much power should lie with the federal government versus the states individually.",eli5

m5pyy,"What is it about Scandinavia that caused it's particular development of social-democracy? edit: How do I add the ELI5 tag to the title?

edit2: I'm real sorry about the extra apostrophe! ","This question may have many answers. But one important part of it is the very short time for democratic development and industrialization. 

* 
The weather favors strict adherence to community and social contracts, getting ""left out in the cold"" has always had a literal meaning in northern countries. 

* 
In many of the scandinavian countries the gentry has been quite weak, and thusly, when democratic reform kicked in, the conservatives where rather weak.
* 
Unlike in many countries, in Sweden, the working class and the industrialists came to terms quite early in what was called ""the Saltsjöbad agreement"" of 1938, where it was stated that both entities had a common goal of development. The working class promised not to protest too much when industry rationalized while the industrialists promised to make sure workers got payed a decent wage.

* It should also be said that looking back, there isn't really a extremely unique phenomena, many countries tackled the crisis of the thirties depression in about the same way. The New Deal in the US was a path towards a more socialistic society as well as many of the measures taken in a lot of other countries in the world. The economist John Maynard Keynes who favoured a sort of economic social liberalism was the go-to-guy for explaining what needed to be done. The difference being that Scandinavia, did not change their policies as the oil crisis hit in the seventies and solidified itself in trying to ""outsmart the downturn"" with more social policys, rather than less (As Thatcher and Reagan did). 

This is just a few explanations, and they are quite generalizing to the point of speculation, but the ""jante-law"" as referred to, is a bit more speculative i find.",eli5

1ss6cl,"why do bank transfers take days if they are 100% electronic? Being electronic, shouldn't they be nearly instantaneous?","One I can finally answer!  A lot of misinformation already in this thread about why the delay happens...

I work for a major credit card company and it's my job to find a way to get payments done faster.  The major hold up is the amount of time it takes to process so many transactions and the methods that we use (here in the US it's ACH - Automated Clearing House and Direct Credit) aren't the best.
Any payment made via ACH has to clear the Federal Reserve System as well and their process only runs once per day.  Direct Credit methods should be better since they eliminate that step, but the difference in communication tools, the times at when the banks run their ""processing streams,"" and the sheer volume of transfers all clog up the direct credit system.

TL;DR - 2 methods to get payments.  1 has to go through the government and the other is like two people trying to have a conversation by writing letters back and forth in a foreign language at different times.

Edit1: I can't go into details about how we and/or banks are fixing this because it's all proprietary stuff, but be assured that it's getting better.

23195s,Why do muscle knots form on your back/neck ect? ,"Doctor here.

Muscle knots, aka ""trigger points"", represent small areas of a muscle that experienced a sustained contraction...similar to a muscle cramp but on a smaller scale. 

There are many theories as to why these occur, but it appears to be due to multiple factors involving the spinal cord, pain receptors, excessive acetecholine (neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contractions), and injury. Some studies have found results that suggest some sort of central sensitization(meaning in the central nervous system) results in hyperactivity in those peripheral muscles, leading to trigger point formation. Trauma of some sort, whether direct or indirect(such as muscle overuse) can contribute to trigger point formation. Generation of spontaneous electrical activity also seems to play a role in trigger point formation, as studies have found differences in the electrical activity around these tender areas compared to nontender areas.

The short of it is -- we're not really sure what causes them, but it's likely due to a variety of problems. The good news is they are usually easily treatable through myofascial release using manual massage, foam rolling, dry needling, and other techniques.

If you'd like to read more in depth about some of the theories behind how these form, this paper seems to cover the basics and more:

4cw0ps,"Why can my laptop turn on immediately after I plug it in when it's completely dead, but my phone takes around 10 minutes?","Your laptop can run off of the battery, or off of the power adapter directly, meaning you can remove the battery and plug the laptop in, and it will still work.  And if the battery is dead, plugging the laptop in will cause the laptop to run off the mains power while the battery is simultaneously being recharged.

However, in order to simplify the electronics, your phone can *only* run off the battery.  If you remove the battery and plug it in, nothing will happen.  So when the battery dies and you plug the phone it, it has to charge the battery back up to some minimal level of power before the phone can turn on.",eli5

Gasses dissolve more readily in colder temperature, so your best bet if you don't want a can to foam over is to put it in the fridge for a few minutes to let the CO2 re-dissolve into the liquid.

6pe2f5,"Why is it better to get uninterrupted sleep than the same number of hours of fragmented sleep? And why do some people require more sleep than others? I'm tired, Reddit.","Not all sleep is the same. You go thru stages over the hours, from light sleep (alpha) to REM. 

During periods of relaxation, while still awake, our brain waves become slower, increase in amplitude and become more synchronous. These types of waves are called alpha waves.

The first stage of sleep is characterized by theta waves. The difference between relaxation and stage 1 sleep is gradual and subtle. As the sleeper moves to stage 2 sleep theta wave activity continues. 

Stages 1 and 2 are relatively ""light"" stages of sleep. In fact, if someone is awoken during one of these stages, he or she will often report no being asleep at all. That's why fragmented sleep is not good, you don't go beyond stage 2. 

As you continue to shut down your brain patterns change to delta wave patterns. Delta sleep is our deepest sleep, the point when our brain waves are least like waking. 

After that you sometimes get to REM (rapid eye movement). It's theorized that REM helps the brain clean up memories accumulated during the waking periods (dreams). For that reason hormones are released so the skeletal muscles of a person during REM sleep are effectively paralyzed so you don't act out your dreams. 

REM sleep a sleepers brain waves demonstrate characteristics that are similar to waking sleep, a combination of alpha, beta, and desynchronous waves. 

In a normal night's sleep, a sleeper begins in stage 1, moves down through the stages, to stage 4, then back up through the stages, with the exception that stage 1 is replaced by REM, then the sleeper goes back down through the stages again. **One cycle, from stage 1 to REM takes approximately 90 minutes**. This cycle is repeated throughout the night, with the length of REM periods increasing, and the length of delta sleep decreasing, until during the last few cycles there is no delta sleep at all.

So you sleep for less than 90 min you don't complete a full cycle and without a few cycles you don't feel rested because your brain cleanup is not done.

If you choose to go back to sleep, you reset the cycle, and will typically fall back into Stage 1 and maybe even hit Stage 2. You can easily be woken out of Stage 1, but because it's the middle of a sleep cycle, and not the natural awakening, you feel unrested.

There is no real common definition of what a ""human right"" even is, and no mechanism for enforcing ""human rights"" other than things like economic sanctions from other countries.

 > why are water companies allowed to charge?

Because transporting clean water to the entire population costs money.  The water has to be filtered and cleaned, and physical pipes have to be built and maintained.

If they couldn't charge, then there would be no way to pay for any of that, and they'd just shut down their company.  At that point, you'd be stuck relying on catching your own rain water, digging your own well, or hauling buckets down to the river (whichever is most convenient for you).",eli5

Some would argue that now that we have the Bible, there is no need for prophets. Others just don't like to assign the word ""prophet"" except to people who the Bible refers to as such.

But Jesus, the disciples, and then Paul, all said that people would prophesy in the future. The New Testament talks about the Holy Spirit causing Christians to prophesy, so it could be that the church is no longer divided into prophets and non-prophets. *All* Christians are potential prophets. (But what that means, exactly, depends on what denomination you belong to.)

And consider Paul. He lived after Jesus' died. He experienced a divine revelation, and his letters to the early church are included in the New Testament. Christians consider them inspired scripture. Basically, Paul is a prophet in all but name.

As a Catholic and an Irish American, I'm often told my by grandparents and other community elders about how the English ""stole"" Northern Ireland, but at the same time no one has ever explained to me how they got away with it. If they really did just refuse to hand it back with the rest of the island, why don't they have more pressure put on them by the other developed nations to hand it back (like they do with for example Gibralter or the Falklands)? If they didn't, what happened, and why did it cause so much hatred on both sides?

Edit: Psyk60 has given me a great answer. Thanks for the help everyone!","If it was up to England, Northern Ireland would probably have been handed back in the 70s or something. Generally speaking, most people in Great Britain (so including Wales and Scotland as well as England) would have preferred giving Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. At least that was the case until recently, if you excluded don't knows and undecideds.

The majority of the population in Northern Ireland want to remain part of the UK. That's the fundamental reason why it's still part of the UK.

Giving it to Ireland despite the majority being against it would cause huge problems. It would probably immediately descend into civil war. There are a lot of people in Northern Ireland who will fight to keep it from being ruled by the rest of Ireland.

So most people now would prefer Northern Ireland stays in the UK to avoid that happening. Now that violence from republican groups has mostly died down, people don't want to upset the status quo too much and take the risk that unionist groups will start the violence up again.

edit - I guess you're also asking about the history too.

England conquered Ireland (the whole thing) a long time ago. They solidified their rule in the 16th Century.

After that there were a few waves of colonisers from England and Scotland, particularly in what is now Northern Ireland. This meant that by the time the war of independence happened, most people there were protestants who were descended from the settlers. So they did not want to be ruled by Irish Catholics. 

As a sort of compromise, the UK agreed to partition Ireland into two, and each one would get to vote to remain in the UK (well technically rejoin it) or become part of the Irish Free State. But the borders were drawn in such a way that the outcome was inevitable, and Northern Ireland stayed in the UK.

Of course this was all really unfair. The native Irish were being ruled by a ""Protestant elite"" and their rights were limited, and they were generally oppressed. But stuff like that was pretty typical between the 16th and 19th Centuries. Britain and other European powers were doing it all over the world. Not that it excuses it, but it was how it was. By the time this sort of colonial behaviour was starting to be considered unacceptable, Northern Ireland already had a large number of people who were there because of it.",eli5

I'm curious if early humans had some different build, but because of having to reproduce and fill the earth, we had incest upon incest, making what we see as normal now a genetic mutation then.

This is because healthy genes are usually stronger (dominant) and unhealthy genes are weaker (recessive)

But with incest the amount of genes the two people have in common is greatly increased which means that if there is a ""faulty"" gene somewhere is their DNA then there is a much greater chance of two faulty genes matching up.

Edit 2: Could this method apply to antibiotic resistant bacteria instead?

The fourth mechanism of antibacterial action works on the disruption of membrane structure.

So we've already created antibiotics that work by disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria, but because viruses don't have cell membranes (and aren't cells to begin with), those compounds have no effect on viruses.

Most teams do play like this, but it more often goes the other way around. A losing team who needed a win (in a cup game, say) might start playing 2-4-4, throwing players forward in an attack. The defending team would then be forced to keep all their players back, maybe playing 9-0-1 - leaving a striker upfront to receive long balls.

1qloe5,"Why are there so many fights in ice hockey? For someone with no idea about ice hockey, only that we only ever seem to see the fights from it. ","Simply put: it's about a code of etiquette and sportsman like behavior. In all sports, there's rules and there are players who skirt those rules and  there are times where its almost against the rules.    In Ice Hockey, because of its physical nature and the velocity of the players, hits hurt and there are okay places to hit and okay ways to hit another player. If a player skirts the line between okay and against da rules: the ref's technically can't call a penalty. But the other team will police that sort of action because it can lead to career ending injuries. That's why a lot of the fights start; a policing action by one team on the other to the statement of ""that's a dick thing, punch time."" This is especially true when it comes to each team's goal tender. They have a blue half circle in front of the goal that's a 'no touchie' zone but once they scoot out side of it for a better angle on the play; fair game to get run over. But that's a dick thing to do and the victim's team will punish the player who did it.    A second reason why is because it energizes a crowd. There are a few great times when a crowd goes wild; a break away, a fantastic play combination to a magnificent goal, and a fight. Hockey players, like most athletes, can get a massive boost in confidence when a crowd is cheering and vocally engaged in the game. Boring game? Attention elsewhere. So a quick and easy way for a hockey match to get re-energized is to have a brawl. This motivation is less often that the other two.    A third and final reason is player egos and hotheadedness. You have grown men (or women) who know they're good playing against others who also know they're good, and it's a clash of personality and mentality and sometimes they just start swinging.",eli5

2hguhb,"Why do computer manufacturers still include USB 2.0 ports alongside 3.0 ports? If they've already got a USB 3.0 chip in there, and 3.0 is obviously backwards compatible, what's the benefit to them of limiting some ports to the 2.0 standard?","There are a few reasons you still see USB 2.0 alongside USB 3.0.

1) The Input/output chip found on Intel computers (Which is most computers you buy) only provides 6 USB 3.0 ports on desktops and 2 on mobile.  This is a big limiter.

2) It increases design complexity, there are 9 wires in 3.0 vs 4 in 2.0.  Multiply that difference by how many ports we have 3.0 over 2.0 and you end up with a bunch of extra space used just for wiring.  Going above the 6or 2 from 1) and you're adding extra chips and even more wiring yet.

3) It costs more for the manufacturer to add more USB 3.0. Each of those chips to add USB 3.0 ports costs around 5-7$, each adding 2 ports, or around 10$ if it adds 4 ports.  

4) For the added cost and complexity, the majority of uses for USB ports don't need the extra speed.  Input devices, various adapters, even USB sticks tend to be more than happy with what USB 2.0 can provide.  Mass transfer to external hard drives, SSDs or high performance USB sticks are almost the entirety of devices that benefit from USB 3.0.  More than 2 of these won't be used at a time very often.

5) More USB 3.0 add-on controllers will take bandwidth away from other parts of the system.  Add too many and something will need to give out, such as running your GPU with half it's normal bandwidth or lowering internal expansion.

6) Legacy, modern Windows 8 or 8.1 tend to be happy to work on USB 3.0 out of the box (especially with the built in Intel or AMD ports) but Windows 7, various Linux distributions or tools that run outside of Windows won't always work.",eli5

svk2e,"- Why I have to eat fruits and vegetables everyday to stay healthy, but an Inuit can go his whole life without ever seeing a vegetable? ","From wikipedia: 

 > While it is not possible to cultivate plants for food in the Arctic the Inuit have traditionally gathered those that are naturally available. Grasses, tubers, roots, stems, berries, fireweed and seaweed (kuanniq or edible seaweed) were collected and preserved depending on the season and the location.


 > Because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet.

 > Vitamins and minerals which are typically derived from plant sources are nonetheless present in most Inuit diets. Vitamins A and D are present in the oils and livers of cold-water fishes and mammals. Vitamin C is obtained through sources such as caribou liver, kelp, whale skin, and seal brain; because these foods are typically eaten raw or frozen, the vitamin C they contain, which would be destroyed by cooking, is instead preserved.

tl;dr: They do have access to some kind of plants, and many of the vitamins we usually get from plants are also found in the animals that they eat in abundance. In addition, Western diets require more of the nutrients in healthier foods to help the body deal with the higher amount of saturated fat that we eat relative to Inuits.",eli5

a62ti2,Why aren't you allowed cellphones and other wave emitting equipment in a mine?,"Cell phones do not work underground due to all the rock shielding the radio signals. So there is no reason to bring it with you. However in a mine there are lots of dangers that can potentially be triggered by cell phones. They often use radio signals to set off explosives. This was in fact one of the first used of radio. However the triggers they use are very simple as they are designed to be disposable and to not have interference. So it is possible that a phone can set off these explosives just like it can interfere with a speaker if you put them too close. And secondly a mine often have explosive atmospheres. They often have lots of explosive dust and can come upon pockets of methane or other explosive gasses. So anything that can make a spark is prohibited. Even a small cell phone will generate thousands of volts in its antenna. So if there is some sort of damage, for example water or soda having corroded away some of the material close to the antenna, then the phone might create a spark which can detonate the atmosphere.",eli5
5f6zk6,Why can't you divide a number by 0? Mathematics,"Algebraic reason for this is that, division is just multiplication. If you're dividing by 2, you're actually multiplying by half.

If you're dividing by 4, you're actually multiplying by a quarter, or 1/4.

If you're dividing by 0, you're actually multiplying by 1/0.

So if you have 0 x 1/0, that should equal 1, because 0 from both sides simplify away. But

    0 * 1/0 = 1           | 0 = 0+0
    (0 + 0) * 1/0 = 1     | distributivity, (a + b) * x = ax + bx
    0 * 1/0 + 0 * 1/0 = 1 | using the identity on the first row
    1 + 1 = 1
    2 = 1

None of the rules we used above sorta allow us to make any exceptions to them. Basic arithmetic just doesn't allow for 0 to be divisor without things breaking down.

How in analysis you may study this is, instead of trying to divide by 0, you divide by small number **close** to 0, but not 0. So if you divide 1 by 0.001, you get 1,000. If you divide 1 by 0.00001, you get 10,000.

Which is why some think 1/0 should be infinity. Unfortunately, -0.0001 is close to 0 as well, and 1/-0.0001 = -10,000. You get negative infinity if you approach 0 from negative side. So it's not like it being infinity or negative infinity works either. 

And from just common sense standpoint, there really isn't that much you can do to make sense of ""divide 1 to 0 people, how much does each person get?"". Obviously you can answer anything you want, and it makes equal amounts of sense since there are no people you're dividing it with.",eli5

3sviwp,"Why do Emulators always run slow? I have a decent computer, yet it feels like NDS emulators never perform the same as an actual NDS. Purely from specifications comparison, my computer should be significantly faster than an NDS. Why is it so slow then? Also, why isn't there a 3DS emulator out yet? ","Imagine this, your 3DS is a horse. It thinks horse thoughts, and does horse things very well, like running around, because it's natural and the way it's built.
But let's say your PC is a human. It does human things very well, and then someone comes along and tells him to do horse things. So he has to think, maybe get a horse costume, maybe get a friend to play the horse butt, and then learn how to think horse thought ON TOP of your human thoughts. And even then the result is not perfect and propably doesn't run as fast.

So to come back to the question, a 3DS is built to do 3DS calculations with 3DS hardware and software. Modern game systems are very specifically designed to do the calculations they need to do to perform.
On the other hand, your PC works very differently, and has to imagine to be a 3DS first, and can only then try to do the things a DS does. That slows it down.
As PCs get better and faster, naturally you can solve this by brute force and some clever coding, but newer systems are always a problem.",eli5

5d6880,Why does putting your card into a plastic bag make it work in a card reader. ,"The strip on the back of your credit card is actually a small magnetic field.  When you swipe it in a card machine, it reads these small magnetic fields and registers them as either a zero or a one, otherwise known as binary code.  Binary code is a set of these ones and zeros that can represent a number, letter, or even an instruction for the computer to carry out.  The back of your card will have several of these sets of binary code that ultimately represent your cards unique number.  

When your card gets scratched or otherwise dirty, it can create anomalies when the reader attempts to register the numbers.  When this happens, the card is not processed and you'd have to try again.  Card readers are sensitive so any little thing that could cause the magnetic field to be read incorrectly might cause it to fail.  When you use a bag or scotch tape, it creates a buffer that allows the magnetic strip to still be translated by the reader, but also can mitigate possible anomalies caused by the scratches or dirt because they're not directly rubbing up against the reading head anymore.

There are times when the card itself will be beyond saving, especially if the strip is scratched deeply or just worn out.  Luckily, most if not all card companies will replace your card free of charge.  Card readers themselves can also be finicky, especially if it's older or is dirty and not cleaned.  Try not to keep your card next to anything magnetic and also away from your cell phone as these can demagnetize the strip, depending on the kind of magnetic strip being used.",eli5

1ln2xc,"Why is there concern over the impact of pesticides on bee populations, but very little discussion on the safety of humans eating honey with pesticides? [Pesticide Residues Found in Honey](_URL_0_)","It has to do with the concept of HAZARD vs RISK.

HAZARD is when a chemical can cause harm, whereas RISK is how likely the chemical will cause harm.  Risk also takes into account the concentration of a chemical in a body.

The reason the pesticide argument focuses on the bee population is that bees are much, much smaller than humans.  If 1 microgram (10^-6 gram) of pesticide gets ingested by a bee weighting 0.1 g, that's 0.01% of it's total weight.  For a human weighing 100 kg (easy math, 10^5 g), that's 0.000000001% of their weight.  As you can see, the small amount of pesticides found in the honey will affect the bee much more than the human, purely based on concentration.

That being said, bees and humans will be affected differently by different chemicals.  For example, a pesticide may target a specific protein only found in insects, but have no effect in humans since we do not have the same protein in us.",eli5

10xgsp,"why the Chinese are building ghost cites? Why/how do they keep them unoccupied? I mean there lot's of space people could move right in, what is preventing them?","The government has lots of money and building things creates lots of jobs as well as drives many other sectors. The houses ARE sold, I know they are empty but it's becauset eh people buying them are investing in one of the only real ""safe"" (debatable) investment opportunity they have, real estate. So they buy these houses with the hope that the price will go up as the area gets more developed. 

The government is selling everyone on this idea by saying that there are still hundreds of millions of people in the country without houses who want to move to the city and it's true except no one is mentioning that most of them don't have the money to buy these houses and instead it's mostly the middle class who is buying second and third houses for investment or to rent out.

This all seems like a VERY terrible idea until you realize a couple things, first off these houses are being bought with cash a lot of the time. Chinese have been saving very well for a long time and they are now spending, so if the markets crash the government is hoping it wont take down too much, it will just lower the amount of savings people have, not good of course but nothing like what happened to the USA. 

Secondly, The country needs this building to continue so that the construction market doesn't crash as huge numbers of the impoverished have jobs in this sector and if it crashes these people all lose their jobs and there goes the countries stability ast hey'll have tens if not hundreds of millions of people out of work over night. 

Thirdly, the country has HUGE amounts of money, they can build these cities with the hope that in the future they will become booming metropolises. If it doesn't work, it is a waste of money but that's the one thing China has to waste right now.

So yeah, it looks like a terrible idea but there is logic behind it. Whether it will work is still to be seen. According to government stats and economic  predictions, it's working great, according to many who are watching, the government is hiding what's going on and a crash is coming. Either way it's an interesting time to be alive and in China!

Edit: ""what is preventing them?"" - Answered this vaguely above, to be clear, the houses are empty but they aren't without owners. It's like if you have a house in Tampa and one in NY where you live, what's to stop homeless people from taking over your Tampa house. It's yours. The police wouldn't be cool with it.

As well, an interesting side note that is probably good for understanding what seems to be a complete lack of long term logic to all this. The people buying these houses are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on what amount to small appartments in the West, the prices are insane, far beyond the Western cities in terms of how much they cost VS how much they make. And what I love about this, is they don't actually own anything, it's a 70 year rental agreement they are buying, the government still owns the land so they are spending their life savings to rent three or four units at incredibly over valued prices and 70 years later they lose it all regardless. I asked a business lady I taught about this a couple years ago, she had just bought a new house (her second) and I asked what about in the future? Her answer was ""The house wont last more than 20 years anyway before it falls apart so I'm not worried"". The construction is so shit here that these buildings have a 20-30 year shelflife before they need to be rebuilt anyway, now your ""ownership"" of the house does entitle you to another in the building that is built on the spot but who knows if they'll have the money to rebuild all these houses again 30 years from now and if they do, who  knows if the new houses will be big, small or anything about them. It's a truly beautiful and mind boggling insane system! I would hate to be a part of it but as someone sitting on the side watching, it's like some crazy never ending soap opera!

79ovdf,"What causes us to laugh at things, instead of just smile","Laughing is a way that humans diffuse conflict and promote bonds. Laughing signals to another person that you enjoy their company, but also that you aren't going to attack them. And it's audible for the same reason that we make other mouth sounds: more communication. This is a useful skill in a species that works in groups.

Imagine that someone accidentally trips you and you fall on your ass. You *could* get angry, and some people would. But others would feel compelled to laugh, even if it's awkward. We tend to like those people more, because they're reassuring the rest of us that the situation isn't that bad.

jsaea,How did Jews of today become what they are from what Jews were back in the bible days in the middle east? Basically what is the difference between [these Jews](_URL_0_) and  the jews from bible times? Why and when did this happen?,"Back in the first century AD, the Romans ruled the area where the Palestinian Territories and Israel are now.  The Romans called it Judaea though.

The Jews didn't like being ruled by the Romans, and they kept rebelling over and over.  Finally, in 123 AD, the Romans kicked them out of their capital city (Jerusalem) and most of the Jews left Judaea and moved to other parts of the Middle East and Europe.

Fast forward 1700 years. The Jews in your picture are called Hasidim. They are part of an ultra-Orthodox (super strict, super traditional) branch of Judaism that started in Poland and eastern Russia. They suffered a lot of persecution, so they followed rabbis (religious leaders) who taught them to find joy and mysticism in their religion to escape the sadness of everyday life.

Most of these communities were wiped out in the Holocaust, but some of the famous Rabbis and their followers were able to escape to New York and Israel (and I'm sure other places). 

They wear the black suits because those are the same clothes that were in fashion when Hasidism started. I think it's pretty crazy, they wear clothes suited for Polish weather when you're in Israel? 

It's kind of the same as how the Amish wear the same clothes as they did when their branch of Christianity started.  I guess if you think you've found the perfect religion, don't change anything.

8dmbvm,"Why US legislation seems more ""messy"" than other first world countries? Or is it just sensationalized by the news media? When looking at legislation in other countries like Canada or France, it seems to make more sense and more progressive whereas US legislation is all over the place with variations across different state lines. Is this due to the widening education gap or is it the sensational news by the media to target US audiences to show how confusing the legislation is?","Canadian here. Also federal organization, also common-law based. Not only that, but our Constitution, like many other Commonwealth countries, is partly unwritten convention (tradition). And we have the Living Tree Doctrine, which says that the Constitution always has to be re-interpreted based on modern times. Overall, it can get messy.

My guess is that the simplicity you perceive in passing of day-to-day legislation is based on the existence of a Parliament, rather than a Congress. Edmund Burke suggested that the essential difference between the two is that in a Congress, people are expected to represent their riding first, and put national interest second; whereas a Parliament is the other way around.

One can agree or not, but operationally, a Parliament (even in a semi-presidential system like France) operates on the idea that there's a Prime Minister who is the leader of the party with the most number of seats. S/he appoints Cabinet and heads the Government, directly, or through the head of State. S/he gets to stay PM *as long as the government retains the confidence of the house.* If a government bill gets defeated, either someone else in Parliament demonstrates that they can get the confirmation of the house, or Parliament dissolves and you go to election.

That gives everyone a lot of incentive to vote along party lines.

Now, when Parliamentary governments are *majority* governments ( > 50% of the seats in the house are the same party as the government), it's all pretty simple. They're going to retain confidence of the house--as long as their own members don't vote against them. So you see, it's much harder in Canada for a member of Parliament to vote based on constituent preferences rather than party lines. It's not unheard of, but it scuttles one's chances of influencing very much in Ottawa.

Minority governments get more complicated (noting that most democracies have multiple political parties in play) because either governments must be coalitions of multiple parties, or the government has to continuously win the confidence of other parties to stay in power.

Finally, besides the ""upper house"" (unelected Senate in Canada with a largely apolitical, functionary role) and the higher courts, there's no ""executive check"" in Canada. The Governor-General in practice always provides Royal Assent when asked--there's no veto. And the Governor-General doesn't try to influence what happens in parliament.

Imagine if US Congress changed to that:
-the House majority leader appointed Cabinet 
-all Cabinet members had to be Representatives 
-the House majority leader was the head of government 
-the House majority leader would lose that status if the House ever voted down a Cabinet member's bill
-the President was still CinC, but not allowed to make a single command (or tweet) without the advice and consent of Congress

...then you'd have a system that looks much more like Canada's.

This allows Canada to be progressive--when our governments see changes they think need to be made, they can mostly just make them without a lot of hardship. If people don't like it, they get voted out within 4-5 years. It does also mean that individual constituencies can get lost. More conservative people than me also argue that progress shouldn't be quite as easy as it is in Canada, and there'd be some merit to that. Overall, I prefer our system, but fully recognize my bias in saying that.",eli5

Some smells are caused by Thiols, very very tiny odor causing compounds.  They emit odor long after washing. Thiols' odor gets ""stronger"" if you wash with just water (that's why you  don't just wash with water). The only way (that I know of) to get rid of the smell is to wash with a mixture of Water, Soap and Hydrogen Peroxide. This mixture causes oxygen to be formed and the Thiols release

6765hu,Why do some airplanes leave an exhaust trail but others do not? ,"If you're talking about [contrails](_URL_1_), those are not from exhaust.  Or at least, not strictly exhaust.

Contrails form when conditions are right, involving humidity, temperature, and air pressure.  Small particulates from the exhaust create [nucleation sites](_URL_0_) for ice crystals to form.  Nucleation is kind of its own ELI5, but the short version is that ice can't form unless there's a place to start from.  Once a little bit of ice starts, the rest of the water can stick to that to make the clump bigger, but generally something has to be there to start it.  When conditions are just right, the water vapor in the air kind of primed to become thicker clouds of ice crystals, but it's not quite cold enough for ice to form without help.  As the plane flies through the air, the tiny particulates provide the last bit needed for the vapor to condense into clouds of ice particles.

Those clouds form the trails behind the engines.  When conditions are *just* right, planes can also cause trails to form at the wingtips as the turbulence from the aerodynamics changes the air pressure, causing a trail to form.

Why it happens to some planes and not others depends on the air conditions around the plane.  The altitude changes those conditions, so altitude matter, airspeed matters, and small changes make a big difference so that not all planes can create them all the time.",eli5

Like, say Bill has $1000.  So then he donates it to charity, and he gets to subtract the $1000 from his income for the year.  So he doesn't have to pay income tax on that thousand dollars.  let's say the tax rate is 30%.  So now Bill gets an extra $300 back on his tax return.

But it cost him $700!

Why do people do this?  Am I misunderstanding something here?  Wouldn't Bill have been better off with the thousand dollars?","People are spending a lot of time talking about brackets and such, but that's probably because of your example. People don't, in my experience, get super-excited about write-offs on charitable donations. It's nice and all, but you give because you wanted to give in the first place.

The real write-offs that people get jazzed about are those that allow a deduction for expenses that either aren't optional or allow them to get something they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

For example, small business owners might pay medical insurance premiums out of their business account--you can write that off as an expense. You were going to have to pay it anyway, but doing so in the right way reduces your tax burden.

Or you might want to take a strategic write-off. Maybe you have some stocks in the hole that you want to get rid of. If you can, you hang onto those until you have a pretty good year for income otherwise, and you sell them at a loss to help reduce your taxable income.

225pai,"Why are some laws worded vaguely? Wouldn't laws be more effective if they had some quantifiable numbers or be more specific in their laws?  Are there historical or political reasons behind this? Leaving the law to ""interpretation"" doesn't make much sense to me.  ","Vague laws allow for them to be interpreted in courts by judges, lawyers, and juries, so that previous interpretations of laws can be used for future interpretations of laws -- this is the entire process that common law is based off of. It comes with *a lot* of flexibility.

If we used a civil law system then there's no flexibility, it doesn't allow for the law to grow, change, or be interpreted by people. It is what it is. Edit: More importantly, it's not what it's not.

For instance, a law against killing another human being would have to specify all of the types of ways you might kill someone for it to be effective under civil law and then list all of the possible exceptions. In common law, it says ""You can't kill people"", and that meaning is left up to those who determine guilt or not in any given situation.",eli5

34wqda,Do earthquakes on one side of the world affect tectonic plates on the other side? Asking this because there has been a lot of talk about the Big One in California. And there have been many large earthquakes in recent years and now these.,"Not really, because we are talking about plates that are not connected in any significant way. The Nepalese earthquake involved the Eurasian and Indian plates at a fault line that is no where near the Pacific plate. Now, if we are talking about a significant shift in the Pacific plate on the Japanese side we might be more concerned about a shift on the same Pacific plate on the Californian side...but the Pacific plate is [very large](_URL_0_) (in yellow) and borders many different plates...it makes it difficult to predict where the next ""big one"" will be based on past events.

More importantly IIRC the ""big ones"" are mostly calculated based on the likelihood at that particular fault line in relation to that fault line's past events, not in relation to other plates or other fault lines. Thus the next big one in California is predicted to happen soon because their hasn't been one in California for many decades and the fault lines are building up pressure which eventually must be released. Of course California itself is made up of many different fault lines, some of which have not been released in a long time, others more recently (e.g. 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake). Therefore you would expect even within California to have different risks associated with different faults.",eli5

1ot9ak,Why can't fish that live in salt water survive in freshwater? ,"Osmosis is a process in cell membranes under which water goes from areas of low solute concentration to high solute concentration.

Organisms generally can't live with lots of salt inside them, so saltwater fish have low levels of salt inside themselves, but are surrounded by water that has high concentrations of salt. So they are constantly losing water through osmosis. As a result, they are built to constantly ""drink in"" more water (and have their kidneys filter out the salt).

Freshwater fish generally have a higher level of salt inside their bodies than in the surrounding water. They are constantly taking in water through osmosis. They are therefore built to constantly ""pee"" out excess water.

Since most saltwater fish are built to deal with osmosis in a way that is *opposite* from the adaptation they need, they cannot survive in fresh water. They do not have the same adaptions to rapidly get rid of water from their bodies, since they are used to water naturally leaving their bodies through osmosis.",eli5

431sqd,Why does underarm skin color becomes darker for other people but not for some? ,"There are multiple reasons, but the most common ones I know of are (1) the buildup of dead skin cells and (2) shaving. 

(1) Your underarms are a sweaty body part, and when that sweat comes up, there are bacteria that mix with the sweat and cause a bad smell. All of that can cause a constant buildup of dead skin cells  and they make your underarms look darker and darker. The best fix for that is to use an exfoliate 2-3 times per week to scrub off all those built up layers of dead skin. It takes a while to see the skin get lighter, because the dead cells have been piling on for so long.

(2) Hair grows under the skin and then pushes through the skin to show on the surface. So when people shave their underarms, that is just getting the top part of the hair, not the part underneath. If the person shaving has darker hair, then those hairs under the skin might still show on top, but instead it looks like a dark shadow on the underarms. It's basically the same as a man's 5 o'clock shadow. The best alternative to shaving to get rid of the shadows and the hair is waxing. Waxing over time on a regular basis will also exfoliate the skin and get rid of those dead cells.

}else{

6kbg28,How come we can't always tell which nationality a singer is by just their singing voice? ,"Every singer has influences. There were artists that they admired and wanted to be like, and that influenced their style and performance. And those influences? They had influences too.

So, why can't you call the nationality by the singing voice? Because most English speaking pop stars had influences that were American -- or their influences had American influences, and so on. This goes back to the 1950s, when rock and roll emerged in the southern United States and spread very quickly as a popular music style.

You can see this in a lot of British artists; many say that they ""sound American"" because they affect a rhotic accent when the sing, even though they may have a non-rhotic accent in their speech. You see this all the way back to the British Invasion of the mid 60s -- groups like the Beatles and The Rolling Stones were emulating their influences, which were people like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis and the other pioneers of rock and roll.

That said, not everybody did that. Herman's Hermits, for example, have their accent quite noticeable in their performances. But still these influences have trickled down from artist to artist over the last 60 years.",eli5

5fe6mq,Compressing air by hand in a pump creates heat but compressing it far enough to form a liquid leaves you with extremely low temperatures. At which point does the temperature change from hot to cold and why does this happen? ,"At sea level, 15 degrees Celsius air has a density of approximately 1.225 kg/m^3.

Liquid air has a density of approximately 870 kg/m^3.

You do not get liquid air by primarily compressing it. You get liquid air by significantly lowering the temperature. The boiling point of liquid air is approximately negative 194.35 degrees Celsius. Creating liquid air requires removing a significant amount of heat from it.

* ""The constituents of air were once known as ""permanent gases"", as they could not be liquified solely by compression at room temperature.""

In other words, your premise is not correct. Compressing air does not heat it then magically become cold by turning liquid.

7n4xs1,why does it seem that there is no cheese in Chinese food?,"As others have mentioned, most Asian people are lactose intolerant. From a western perspective this seems odd, but is actually the ""normal"" human condition. Everything that follows is from Marvin Harris's book Our Kind, which I'm trying to simplify into ELI5 style.

Lactose is the sugar in milk. Your body can't use lactose, and has to break it down into simpler sugars. This is done by the enzyme lactase. ""Naturally"" mammals produce lactase while they are nursing from their mothers, but then stop producing it as they grow older because ""naturally"" they won't ever consume milk again.

I say ""naturally"" and ""normal"" because humans are different, we developed agriculture and domesticated other animals. This takes us out of the natural cycle a bit, allows us to do things our biology wasn't really intended for. However, natural selection still applies - if we do something that increases our survival rate and success at reproducing, that trait will be selected and pass on to the next generation, propagate and become ""normal"". These traits can be genetic (genes, like being strong or fast) or cultural (memes, like wearing makeup).

When we started domesticating milk-producing animals such as goats or cows, we gained the option to consume milk as adults. Our natural state does not allow us to do that, but some individuals would be different and possess a mutation wherein they would continue producing lactase as adults, allowing them to consume milk. In some cultures that trait was very valuable, resulting in increased survival and reproduction, thus the trait became very common and eventually the ""normal"". In other cultures the trait had no net gain and therefore does not propagate, and so not the ""normal"".

So what's the difference in the cultures? What makes adult lactase production a big win for those of Northern European descent, but pretty worthless for East Asians? It has to do with geography and available sources of calcium and vitamin D.

You need calcium in your diet. You can get that calcium a few different ways - milk being one, leafy green vegetables being another. To make use of calcium your body also needs either vitamin D or lactose. You can get vitamin D from seafood, or your body can make it when exposed to sunlight. Without vitamin D, lactose assists with the use of calcium. So, cultures with easy access to leafy greens plus sunlight or fish, calcium is taken care of and milk has no advantage. Cultures without access to leafy greens - or without access to sunlight or seafood - need dairy either as a source of calcium, or a source of lactose to use the calcium, or both.

This leads to the difference between dairy that's fermented (yogurt or most cheese) or unfermented (straight up milk). Fermented dairy products still have the calcium, but the lactose is broken down into simpler sugars, so lactase is not necessary to digest it. Therefore a culture with access to fish or sunlight but not leafy greens would benefit greatly from keeping dairy animals, but don't benefit from still creating lactase as adults - they consume the milk as yogurt or cheese to get all the calcium they need and make use of that calcium thanks to vitamin D.

So now finally, enter the Northern Europeans - the people that would eventually become western society as we know it today - developed in a climate that required them to bundle up most of the time due to extreme cold, so no sunlight to make vitamin D. They also had very little seafood in their diets at the time (~12,000 years ago), and limited access to leafy green vegetables. Calcium and vitamin D are lacking. So, those individuals who possessed the ability to consume unfermented dairy as adults had an advantage. They survived and bred more frequently, thus passing the trait on and making it ""normal"". Within 5000 years after the domestication of dairy animals, 90% of northern Europeans possessed the ability to produce lactase into adulthood and dairy of all types was commonplace.

Meanwhile let's consider China ~12,000 years ago. Leafy greens were a major part of the diet, so calcium is not an issue. Those in coastal areas developed fishing techniques much earlier than Europeans, as well as a trade infrastructure to transport that seafood pretty far into the mainland, so vitamin D is not an issue. Thus no advantage to unfermented dairy consumption among the bulk of Chinese. Only those far inland and to the north would have an issue - those peoples who became the Mongols, who did consume dairy. Furthermore even fermented dairy never took hold in Chinese culture because of their trade networks - the Chinese were able to obtain their labor animals from other cultures (tibetans, mongols, etc) - therefore did not breed their own cows or goats. Pigs were the primary meat animal raised. With no need for dairy, and without really having it around in the first place, they developed into a culture with virtually zero dairy of any type. And much like the Northern Europeans went on to culturally dominate western civilization, Chinese culture influenced many others in Asia.

So... in summary (TL;DR): Dairy consumption has 2 extremes produced by geography and available diets: Lots of dairy including raw milk driven by Northern Europeans, and virtually zero dairy of any kind driven by the Chinese. Between those extremes are everybody else, who for the most part made use of fermented dairy for its calcium, but remain lactose intolerant.

248qog,"How did the decline of the Ottoman Empire effect world history over all? No matter what I read I don't seem to understand how this really effected the world overall. 

I understand how the decentralized system of empire caused the Ottomans to stagnate technologically, which meant they lost land to Europeans, especially Austria, who used rifles, trains and other newer technologies and had economies that dwarfed that of the Ottomans. 

Everything was fine until the rise of nationalism in the 19th century in which each culture demanded its own state.  

I just don't know what else to read to understand how this works and it's a big part of my final tomorrow and i have no idea what the deal is.
","* Collapsing empires and monarchs trying to hold onto power was the cause for WW1.
* The Ottoman's collapse and subsequent split into 'mandates' for the victorious WW1 victors drew somewhat arbitrary borders for nation-states, relating to colonial negotiations between Britain and France for resources rather than corresponding to actual groups of people.
* The post WW1 borders are really the cause of a lot of the ongoing political turmoil in the region.  The creation of Israel, the displacement of palestinians, Syria's unnatural borders covering a lot of different groups.  You name it.
* The fall of the Empire and subsequent domination by foreign powers affected the psyche and pride of the people there.  The idea of the Caliphate - a single Muslim empire - was/is a political and religious goal.  That belief drove leaders like Nasser and Sadat's pan-Arabism platforms, and also sort of explains why Israel is such a wound for them.
* The discovery of oil reserves in the region caused the European WW2 theatre to come to the region as the Axis/Allies fought for the resources.  Oil money has since been largely responsible for keeping often unpopular national leaders in power and foreign influences meddling, and preventing more organic / natural political change.",eli5

Because they are rubber, if the surface is too rough, they can suffer from abrasion and wear out.  Also, because they are rubber, temperature can affect them as well (too cold, they lose flexibility).

So what happened to Challenger when the O-rings failed?   The rockets were made of several tubes joined together.  The best description I've heard is that it's like stacking tin cans and filling them with gasoline. The force and pressure of liftoff can pull the cans apart slightly where you tried to join them, so you line them with a flexible rubber seal, like in canning when you have a rubber seal on a jar.  If the seal doesn't hold, you loose air pressure in the cans and burning fuel can escape -- you lose propulsion and get a big explosion.

Rubber o-rings lined those joints in the space shuttle and kept burning fuel from leaking out. That morning, the temperature was too low, the rubber was not flexible enough, and there wasn't a good seal.  Burning fuel, leaking out...an explosion.  One big enough to blow apart the boosters and destroy the shuttle.",eli5

b6wdcg,"Why are records still made of vinyl? I know they're more of a collector's item nowadays, but haven't we invented any materials that are more durable or would otherwise be better for the job? My boyfriend is really into records and he's tired of me pestering him about this. I've heard that records used to be made of something called shellac and then it turned into vinyl around the 1930s. But that only caught on when they started using lighter needles that didn't damage the record. It's almost 90 years later now, haven't they made a material better suited for the job? Maybe something that's more durable so they don't scratch as easily, for example.  


Edit: I'm adding this because it seems to be coming up in the comments a lot: I am well aware that CDs and other digital media (mp3s, Spotify etc) exist. What I'm curious about it the reason why vinyl is being used for the big black records my hipster boyfriend likes.","Audio for records is recorded to a surface that is scratched, then a mold is made, then a metal cast is made, called a master, then that metal mold is used to press vinyl into the shape of the recording.  
Vinyl is used because it is easier to get a good copy of the mold without sticking to the metal.  
It's just cheaper and easier, and lasts long enough that most people don't notice the quality degrading.  
Edit: a couple of people have objected to me leaving out an electroplating step. I will say, my explanation is basically correct. I am not an  expert, this is ELI5, one part of the casting step used is electroplating, the terms used vary widely. The part I called a master, is also called a couple of other things at the same step. Enjoy the ELI5 it is technically correct, the best kind of correct, and terms differ in use.",eli5

9fww3n,why does green power overload power grids? I read about California producing so much power with wind and solar that they have to sell it to keep from overloading the grid. Can’t they just “unplug” the windmills and let them keep spinning?,"They don't in general. It is theoretically possible for a storm to cause a wind turbine to generate more power than it is intended to handle, but such a storm is likely to destroy the turbines. I have never read of green energy overloading the grid and cannot find any actual credible sources that state as such. 

The problem that Green energy has is that it does not have stable power production. It has spikes of high energy production (windy day, sunny day, etc) and it has lull periods (night, still days, etc) where it produces virtually no power. We do not currently have reliable storage tech for said power and thus Green energy can only be supplementary and as such there are times when not all of that power is used.",eli5

1jw2uw,". Why do well established companies, such as Coca-Cola, spend so much money on advertising? ","**p7r** had a great answer to this question - [original post](_URL_0_)

I discovered some years ago that the point of most advertising at a certain marque level was not to acquire new customers, but to retain them or even stop ""buyer's regret"".

For example, BMW pretty much never expect somebody to see one of their adverts and think ""Oh, that car looks good, I'll buy one of those!"", because who the hell makes a purchasing decision of that size based on advertising? Most of their advertising is actually focused on people who recently bought one of their cars and is sat there thinking how much of a Ford or GM they could have got for 40% less. It prevents buyer's regret, and pushes them from just a buyer into a brand-loyal fan. It also enhances brand value in general, which is critical when establishing how much your brand is worth financially.

Brand value is where Coca-Cola come in. Frequently in the UK people will say ""it feels like Christmas now"", once the ""Christmas is coming"" Coke ad with santa on lorries going through town is aired. Think about how powerful that is: people associate the celebration of the Messiah's birth, or perhaps the most intense emotional experience of the year that you can point to on a calendar, with a can of sugar water.

When you hear ""Coke"", you immediately think of the colours of the can, the taste of the drink, and have an emotional response which is probably very happy, positive and affirming. That's what a lifetime of Coca-Cola telling you what they stand for has done to you.

Recipe-wise, it's almost identical to Pepsi, but think about how you feel when you think of Pepsi, and how you feel when you think of Coca-Cola. That difference? That's the advertising. And it kicks in when you're stood in front of a fridge about to make a purchasing decision.

Most of the Coca-Cola sold around the World is produced under license, it doesn't come from a magic well, and is relatively easy to synthesise. So how much would the company be worth if it weren't anything special? Their entire advertising strategy is to increase brand value which also helps them whenever a customer hesitates about buying their product.",eli5

9fzlps,What causes enclaves and exclaves to form? ,"Do you mean like political exclaves and enclaves of one country in another?

It's the same reason any other border or boundary forms, and it's different in each case. For example:

- the town of Baarle-Nassau has loads of enclaves and exclaves between Belgium and Holland. That's because those countries in that area formed around the holdings of various dukes. The town contained lots of properties owned by the Duke of Breda and Duke of Brabant. Breda's stuff ended up as Holland and Brabant's stuff as Belgium. 
- Büsingen is an enclave because what is now Switzerland used to be a lose confederation of microstates and city states. Some of these joined Germany (or its predecessors) or Austria and some banded together over time as Switzerland. Schaffhausen and Büsingen both originally joined then-Germany (the Holy Roman Empire) but Schaffhausen was then able to get free and later joined Switzerland. Büsingen wasn't and ended up trapped surrounded by Switzerland by Schaffhausen. Then later when they voted to join Switzerland Germany said no because Switzerland didn't have anything to offer them in compensation.
- Nakhchivan is an enclave if Azerbaijan between Iran and Armenia. It's the result of Soviet policy and ethnic reasons. The whole area had a mix of Azeris and Armenians separated in part by ethnicity and in part by religion. The Soviet Union had a policy of giving each ethnicity its own country while making them all part of the Soviet Union in order, they hoped, to reduce tension. They neatened up the borders and lumped together all the areas that were ""mostly"" one ethnicity even if the split was often 60-40 or what have you. That resulted in three countries: Armenian SSR, Azerbaijani SSR and Nakhchivan SSR. Then at independence the two bits with an Azeri majority (Nakhchivan and Azerbaijan) joined together. 
- Nahwa is a double enclave, part of the UAE surrounded by Oman surrounded by the UAE. Basically around 70 years ago the tribes of the area, who didn't really have any affiliation with any country, were sounded out to ask if they'd like to join the UAE or Oman. Most of the tribes joined the UAE, but one Omani ambassador was particularly persuasive and persuaded tribes in one small area to join Oman. But then there was one village in the middle of that area where the chiefs had family ties to the UAE and so they went the other way.
- Kaliningrad used to be a city state Königsberg founded by Teutonic (german) knights who founded a number of trading ports around the Baltic They all became part of Germany as did Poland. After world war 1 the bits in between Königsberg and the rest of Germany were ceded to the new independent state of Poland to give Poland a coastline but Germany got to keep Königsberg as a historically teutonic town. Then after world war 2 the Soviets invaded Königsberg chucked all the Germans out and then asked if they could be allowed to keep it as they wanted a Baltic port and this one was going spare. At the Potsdam treaty the world said yes
- Campione is a bit of Italy surrounded by Switzerland. When the surrounding area of Ticino voted to leave Italy and join Switzerland this village said ""nah we're good"" and so wasn't included.",eli5
27ywjk,"Why do gas station prices change daily? While grocery store prices stay relatively stable, I don't understand how it can be legal for gas stations to change their prices on gasoline so frequently, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day.
TIA","This is perfect for me to answer. I managed a gas station for about 18 months.

In the gas station business, price is everything. The difference between $3.15 a gallon and $3.20 a gallon might be as much as 250 customers a day. Especially if the gas station across the street is priced cheaper than me.

The price that I sell gas at is largely irrelevant to me, so long as I sell it at slightly higher than my purchase price. A gas station makes most of its profit from purchases made in the store: soda, snacks, candy, and cigarettes.

My goal when setting prices is always to get the maximum number of people to stop for gas without dropping below my purchase price for gas. 

To answer the legality question, as a merchant, I'm free to sell my product at whatever price I want, whenever I want, so long as I have it clearly marked, and I'm not discriminating against certain customers. 

You mentioned grocery store prices being fairly stable, when in fact they aren't. They don't fluctuate quite as rapidly as gas prices, but many staple goods such as milk and eggs change on a weekly basis. Two things prevent you from noticing this change. The first is apathy, unless you are my roommate, you probably only consume about one gallon a week of milk. Because of this, you rarely bother to look at the price tag, because a 10 cent difference in price is meaningless to you. The second factor is the cultural importance that we place on gas prices. Everywhere you drive has giant signs showing you the current price of gas, pundits often use the current price of gas to comment on the current economics, and people are often willing to drive an extra mile or two just to save 5 cents a gallon.

The end result of all of this is that if I want to effectively run a gas station, I have to constantly adjust the price of gas to satisfy my customers.",eli5

25pgqh,Why isn't there any third world countries with a majority of white people? ,"Third world country began as a definition during the Cold War. So I don't think mentioning colonialism as far back as several centuries ago is helpful. But during the Cold War there were a few third world countries that had a majority population of white people. Ireland, Sweden and somewhere else....

The original meaning was any state not affilitated with either NATO or the USSR. It's only since then that the term has developed into a term to mean a poor country/state. 

There are five different ways to test if a country is third world. Simply saying ""white nation pillages"" is a misnomer in my opinion. 

The five: Political rights and stability, Gross National Income, human development, poverty and press freedom. 
 

North Korea is not a thrid world country because of pillaging by the white man. It is considered one because of lack of press freedom, along with 19 other countries. Their internal fascism is the reason they're on the list. 

Then there are war-torn countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, much of Africa. I could give examples of each but this site is helpful: [nations] (_URL_0_)

I'm going to say the main reason is that one or more of the five above does not exist in said third world country and do in first world countries. Education, more separation of church and state, press freedoms et al. That doesn't diminish the fact that there are numerous poor people living within first world countries. And given the size of the USA and Russia, and the EU, they have many more resources to tackle poverty, keep population fed and watered,  etc.

Not simply WHITE MAN KILL BROWN MAN. Though there are instances of such a thing.

22slhd,Why do drugs like heroine cause the user's voice to deteriorate over time? Most long term drug addicts sound like they're slurring their words.. How come ,"As an ex meth addict who hangs out with a lot of former heroin addicts, I'd have to say I haven't noticed any of the ones who are actually clean slurring their words.

There are a few possibilities to explain why long term drug addicts you happen to know are slurring their words:

1 ) They're high.  Being high on heroin fucks up your speech in exactly the way alcohol does.

2) They've suffered brain damage as a result of their heroin use.  Someone else has already mentioned the possibility of a stroke from IV drug use, but there are other ways to get brain damage, such as malnutrition (which is what actually causes ""wet brain"" in chronic alcoholics), and physical violence.

4 ) Others have already mentioned smoking tobacco, which nearly all of the addicts I know do.  This won't make you slur your words, but it does mess with your voice.

5 ) As someone already mentioned, suboxone and methadone are both powerful opiates that could affect your speech.

6 ) Last but not least, and perhaps most likely given that none of the above reasons applies to all heroin addicts, you might perceive them speaking poorly because you know they are drug addicts.  Many people have unique ways of speaking, some of which may be hard to understand or perceived as slurring, and since our brains like to explain things, yours is jumping to the conclusion that these people are slurring because you know they are addicts, and you know that heroin will fuck you right up, and it seems like a good explanation for why they are difficult to understand.  Of course all of this is normal unconscious behavior and doesn't indicate a bias or prejudice towards addicts on your part in any way.

But alcohol messes with those protein receptors. It makes it so they are more sensitive, and will alert your brain to heat at a lower temperature then they normally would. This temperature threshold becomes slightly lower then your body temperature.

So the burning is coming from the proteins thinking that your own normal body temperature is too hot, and reacting as if it were dangerous.

1cle1z,Why does Africa have so many issues? ,"[The search function](_URL_0_) shows a bunch of answers. Here is [one answer](_URL_2_) from the [5 year old's guide to the galaxy](_URL_1_).

---------------------------------------

Imagine Africa is a playground, where a bunch of different kids live all the time. You have one group by the swing set, another all the way on the other side by the basket ball courts, a third live on and around the stairs leading up to the school, and a fourth is by the bike racks. Periodically the bike rack kids throw those hard, small bouncy-balls at the stair kids, and sometimes the stair kids get hurt and fight back, but usually it all ends without too much pain and they keep to themselves.

One day, a group of kids who don't really look like the kids in the playground come inside. While most of the playground kids are wearing dirty tattered old sneakers, these kids have Glow-in-the dark heelies. While only the leaders of the bike rack kids have bikes, the new kids ALL have motorized scooters. And they have guns.

The first thing the new kids do is go into the camp of the swing set kids. They give them Air Heads Extremes, King Sized Twinkies, Coca Cola in Glass bottles - stuff the playground kids had never seen before. In return, they ask the swing set kids to capture the basketball court kids and bring them to the swing sets. Because the swing set kids haven't seen such wealth before, and keep wanting more of it, they happily do as the new kids say. The basketball court kids are all rounded up and taken outside of the playground, and never seen again.

Now the new kids start taking swing set kids. Some swing set kids escape into the bikerack section. Most are taken away, or convinced to start taking away kids from the stairs to bring back.

Then the new kids move on to the bike racks. Though the bike rack kids fight valiantly, the motorized scooters are too much for them, and they are defeated, and forced to start working for the new kids, along with the remaining swing set kids. They start building an even bigger jungle gym, a new candy store, everything the new kids want, they have to do. All the big swing set and bikerack kids are dead or tied to ropes so they can't escape.

And finally, the new kids get to the stairs. They take over, but can't kill or enslave all the stairs kids, because there are too many of them. They need some of the stairs kids to help them, if they are going to rule over the whole playground. So, they convince the stairs kids that everyone who sleeps on an odd numbered stair (eg. the first or third step), that they are better than those who live on even steps, or off the steps entirely. This becomes engrained in stair culture.

Then, one day, the new kids leave. With most of the playground's food and clothing along with them. They leave the guns though. There are still a lot of guns.

What they've left behind is a bike rack section mixed with bike rack kids and swing set kids, and all their usual leaders dead. A minority of the stairs kids have been the ruling class, and have been taught that they are better, more ""new"" than the other kids. Riots for power in this unruled and divided playground erupt all over the place, because resources are scarce or get into the hands of the few. They have forgotten how to live peacefully after many years of ""new"" rule.

The stairs kids are from Rwanda, the other three are West Africans, eg. Sierra Leone, Ghana, Congo. The new kids are European. That's why there are problems.

EDIT: Not actually an edit. But look down the page for more in depth information. I intended this post to just be a jumping off point, not the absolutely, all-inclusive, be-all-and-end-all description of the complex issue of why Africa is fucked up. The parent comment below this one describes an alternate theory based on georgraphic issues, moreso. Very interesting and definitely part of the truth. Check that out.

And just for a more complete truth, imagine that the bike kids also sometimes took the basketball and stairs kids to build their stuff, but the basketball and stairs kids retained some of their cultural identity, resulting in an even more tumultuous bike rack section after the new kids left (former slaves, swing set and bike kids...). It's all about geographical areas with conflicting tribal loyalties (and religious ones), and former leaders dead or corrupted, the order all messed up and then left to sort itself out with very little infrastructure, something called a ""country"" giving it borders, and guns.",eli5

2eiyuf,"Why do long car rides, even If I am the passenger the whole time, make me exhausted? ","As someone who spent 7 months of weekends commuting back and forth across my humble little country, I have a few opinions on this. There's lots of factors: 

* **Less Fresh air**

The engine is pumping out all sorts of hot fumes, people are sitting in an enclosed space breathing out more fumes, and there's just generally not that much air flow. It gets worse if it's cold, or the windows are fogged, and you need the heating on. You can keep the windows open, but that's loud, blustery, bad for fuel economy and damn near painful in anything but hot weather. It's muggy and stuffy and gross. 

So yeah, lack of fresh air makes people drowsy and queezy and just a bit bleugh - sleep or not. 

* **It's loud and vibrate-y**

As much as you're used to traveling by car, it's still a pretty unnatural experience. Vehicles are loud (relatively) and shaky and (naturally speaking) stressful environments. This puts tiny stresses and strains on your body and your mind. Maintain strain long enough, and people get sore and worn out. 

* **It's pretty boring**

Sometimes the scenery is spectacular, but often you're alternating between looking at a highway and checking your phone (when you have signal that is). People's perception of time, and consequently their level of boredom / stimulation depends directly on the frequency of change. If you're doing the same stuff (sitting, chatting, looking out the window) over and over again, you'll get bored, and boredom leads to tiredness. 

* **You have to sit still (with no leg room)**

There's a reason we make our beds so comfortable. Staying still for a long time in an awkward position leads to a build up of the wrong kinds of fluids in the wrong kinds of places. This causes aches and pains and general discomfort over time. 

As much as you might think: ""I sit at a desk for 8 hours a day, and then I sit on the bus to go home and sit at another desk on reddit for a few more hours. I'm a champ of sitting!""  In reality you move and change position and environment a lot more than you would think. You're also free of all the other stressers I mentioned, and have the option to get up and move around the second you feel any discomfort. Not true of car journeys. 

So just the act of sitting down for so long is unnatural and a stresses to our bodies. 

Also, don't underestimate how much more comfort a little extra leg room can provide, which most cars don't allow for - as a short man, I try to relish this whenever I can. 

* **Generally long car trips come attached to other hassle that stresses you out even more**

No one drives across the country for no reason. Even for positive events like personal holidays, there's the stress of packing and organizing and timing and co-coordinating, all around the time you travel, before you can actually enjoy the trip. And that's not even mentioning the often negative reasons we have to travel - work, meeting the parents in law, drug muling under duress. All stressers that add to the pain of long car trips.",eli5

Old recording equipment didn't have the types of improvements we've made since then.

3rn5rq,"Why don't cable providers offer 'pay per channel' packages for like $0.80 a channel? I watch about 5 or 6 channels and I will certainly not be paying for cable when I get a house of my own... So why don't they offer something that we actually want?  Also, isn't the point of having advertisements playing during something (ie. pandora) because that service is free?  If cable costs money and plays adverts aren't they doubling their profit at the expense of us the consumer?","Because by bundling things together they can charge you more for stuff that you don't necessarily want, and that makes them more money. It also allows them to offer more niche programming, because the smaller, lesser-known channels that normally wouldn't have enough people  willing to pay specifically  for that channel are bundled in with the more popular channels that people actually want to pay for. If they let people pick and choose which channels they wanted, people would choose fewer channels overall, and they would have to charge less and make less money overall. Plus they might not have the funds to support less popular channels anymore, or wouldn't be willing to take as much risk providing channels and programs that might not be popular, because the cost would no longer be absorbed by grouping it with profits made from the more popular channels. Basically they know that you dont want all of the channels they offer, and they don't care, because you'll pay for the whole package anyway because you don't have a choice.

Now that being said, things might change because of the advent of services like Netflix and Hulu, which are contributors to driving down the numbers of people who even pay for cable programming at all anymore. They might have to adjust their sales model to compete and convince people that cable really is worth buying even with most shows easily available for free online or through cheaper services. But Netflix and Hulu operate similarly; you pay an overall cost for all of the programming, even though they know that you only want to watch a fraction of it. For a service like that it's easy to see how creating a custom Netflix selection that you choose yourself a-la-carte with different prices for everything would be difficult and impractical. It's easiest to provide a large selection that covers the majority of people's interests and assume that everybody is going to be able to find at least something they like.",eli5

37s4q4,"Why does currency depreciation matter? If currency value drops 50% doesn't that just mean everything requires twice as many arbitrary ""units"" of currency, including wages? EDIT: Got it now. Thanks everybody for the quick and informative answers! And for not mocking my lack of understanding (though I guess that's what this sub is for!)

My understanding:

Say the Canadian dollar drops 50% in overnight. If an hour of your labour (say, as a cashier) was worth **$10** yesterday, it'll be worth **$20** today, since the currency halved in value so it requires twice as many *""units of currency""* as yesterday to pay for the same amount of labour.

Likewise, if a product cost **$100** yesterday, it would cost **$200** today since it requires twice as many *""units of currency""* as it did yesterday before the currency's value was halved.

Yesterday:

* Your job as a cashier paid **$1600/mo**
* Your expenses were (say) **$1300/mo**
* Therefore, your income is 23% higher than your expenses.

Today (after currency value drops in half):

* Your job as a cashier pays **$3200/mo**
* Your expenses are **$2600/mo**
* Therefore, your income is (still) 23% higher than your expenses

*****

TL;DR: **So who cares if the currency dropped in value if everything is identical except the arbitrary number of ""units"" of currency you need to use?**","What about poor old dad who had $450,000 in his 401k?

This is very general - there is no structure that obeys similar rules to addition/multiplication in the complex numbers and has two roots of -1. If you try to create it, you get paradoxes. Here are all the possibilities:

ij = 1

-j = i !

ij = -1

4qkyc1,Equatorial Guinea has an average IQ of 59. What causes this to be so low?,"In this case? Biased / bullshit research. 

That particular figure of an average IQ of 59 comes from the book Race Differences in Intelligence by Richard Lynn. The book has been criticised as having very flawed research methods and using data points that cannot be used across the population. 

For Equatorial Guinea, this in particular is relevant:

 >  Upon reading the original reference, we found that the “data point” that Lynn and Vanhanen used for the lowest IQ estimate, Equatorial Guinea, was actually the mean IQ of a group of Spanish children in a home for the developmentally disabled in Spain. 
 >  > Hunt, E.  &  Wittmann, W. (2008)

Is Equatorial Guinea going to have a lower IQ on average? Yes.

Add in a measure of cultural bias that is inherent in IQ tests, and of course you are going to find a number that is relatively low.",eli5

31eb0c,"Why does one get tired after prolonged exposure to sunlight? Today was a beautiful sunny day, so I went walking on the beach. When I got home I immediately passed out for 2-3 hours (it was still daytime).  I was not tired at all before the walk, and know that it is somewhat of a thing that being in the sun for a while has knack for tiring people out.  Why is this?","adapting to sunlight and heat is metabolically taxing.  Sunlight in particular causes hormone shifts, particularly an upsurge in melanin and melatonin as well as constriction and flooding the body with vit. D.  These directly cause a feeling of tiredness.

Being in the sun causes damage to cells as well, and responding to that damage causes exhaustion (the same is seen following many injuries, and, unsurprisingly, burn victims, where the volume of damaged cells is high.)  I am not clear if the exhaustion is caused by the sudden increase in WBC and hormonal instructions and energy load of cell repair, OR/AND if it is an adaptive response to maximize the effectiveness of those systems.

Finally, the act of staying cool AND active is taxing on the body.  If you are not trying to be active, and it is very hot, your body will decrease function and you could nap/lay still through the heat, but if you are actively trying to work, your body uses active processes (mainly sweating, but also increased heart rate and blood vessel dilation, which require those muscles to be active) Doing this causes a metabic load not only on the krebs cycle, but also on mechanism and the need to balance macro and micro nutrients.  As this adaptation continues, the body continues to weaken because the ability to feed cells (which is, ultimately, based on ratios of exchangeable materials) starts to decrease (the ratios are thrown off.)  In a healthy, well fed person, this can be restored with brief rest.  But, the acute drain can be higher than even a healthy person can adapt to if taken to an extreme (a marathon for instance is very extreme for most people, and not doable at a constant run)  Early signs of failure are dizziness, cramping, and other signs of mental and muscular instability, but this can quickly degenerate into loss of consciousness or seizures, obviously water/electrolyte imbalance is the most common cause, but it isn't the only way.  This is commonly called ""heat stroke.""

Basically, hot, rather than cold, is the most challenging environment for our body's internal processes to adapt to.  Cold requires large caloric intake and artificial methods to retain heat, both of these preserve resources.  But heat requires the body to dump resources, or enter deep states of rest.  note that resting is the adaptive response of people and other warm blooded animals across most desert regions, it just isn't worth the metabolic cost to be active during the hottest part of the day.",eli5

41r2mx,"In the vein of OscarsSoWhite campaign, why is it offensive to start up an NBASoBlack campaign?","Hi CrapfestLicker. Here's my opinion on this. 

The reason that some people think that it's wrong for the Oscars to have so few black nominees isn't because they think that every meritocratic system must have some spots reserved for black people. It's because they feel that in this case, there *are* black people who merit nomination, even when judged by the same objective standard as everyone else. Their argument is that the reason these people weren't picked is because the people who form the academy, aka the folks who vote on the nominees, overwhelmingly skew towards being old and white. They think that naturally these academy members will be more likely to identify with people who look like them and have had more similar life experiences. What they want is for the academy to represent a broader cross-section of America, and then a more diverse selection of nominees to naturally follow. 

People who are offended by the NBA example might be so because the reason there are so few white basketball players is different from the reason that there are so few black Oscar nominees. In the NBA's case, the meritocratic system doesn't have the same type of bias. They don't think that there are white players who merit playing on NBA teams but aren't being selected for the same reason that a majority-white nominating academy may lean away from selecting qualified black actors and directors.

I personally don't find the NBA example to be offensive. I do think, though, that it kind of misses the point.",eli5

4ijes4,How are lakes created by nature (not man made lakes) and how did fish get in them? ,"Land is not level. It's full of crinkles and mashed together piles, and flat areas too. That creates very low areas (ocean), low areas (lakes) and high areas (land), with rain refilling the second type with fresh water. Rainwater runs downhill and has a tendency to accumulate in any sort of depression, so a lake is often ""fed"" from a very big area where uphill rain or snow has fallen, and that's called a watershed.

Those lakes quite often aren't physically closed off, they usually have either permanent outlets that flow to other lakes in the form of streams or rivers, or they can create temporary passageways when flooding conditions occur such as if a beaver builds a dam. Fish then swim up these access points, and some like eels that migrate through wet woods are really good at it. And if the lake they find is healthy and that stream closes off, once they're there, they're there for good.

Nor are those lakes permanently stuck in one place in many cases. Some of them have had fish for millions of years back before fault lines caused a lake to split in two, or stopped an access stream or cut off access to salt water because it was redirected by a landslide or a growing peat bog or beaver dam.

Even remote lakes with no apparent historical access to other bodies of water at all can have fish in them though. They can possibly get there by being transported accidentally by other creatures (e.g. fish eggs stuck to a waterbird's feathers, or in water-weed nesting material that a flying bird drops).",eli5

This is a transistor which functions kind of like light switches.  Flip the switch and you get light/current; turn them off and you don't.

costs a third of that in Finland even 
though the country has virtually no 
agriculture? A universal example would be the Big Mac meal which costs 6€ in Finland and 20HKS (just under 2€) in Hong Kong.","Price is determined by a lot of factors. Here are some:

- The price of shipping (ex. a vacuum cleaner is probably cheaper in America, where it might even be manufactured, in than it is in Fiji, where you'd have to go out of your way to ship it there).

- Tariffs. If you don't know what this means, let's assume that the Swedish government wants people to buy Swedish-made vacuum cleaners only. Let's also say that people don't buy the Swedish-made vacuum cleaners because you can get Finnish ones for 5 euros cheaper. If Sweden wants people to buy the Swedish ones and not the cheaper Finnish ones, they will tax the importation of vacuum cleaners from Finland the appropriate amount to make the Finnish vacuum cleaners *more* expensive to the Swedish consumer than the Swedish vacuum cleaners.

- Income in different places. The general rule is to price something to be no more than what people will pay for it but ABSOLUTELY no *less* than what people will pay for it. So if the kinds of people who buy vacuum cleaners in Poland earn less money than people who buy vacuum cleaners in Brunei earn, the price of a vacuum cleaner will be cheaper in Poland than in Brunei.

- Price of operating the business in the specific country. Some countries tax businesses a lot more than other countries. Let's say that my vacuum shop in Japan has to pay the government $5,000 every month while my vacuum shop in South Africa only pays $50 a month. I would have to sell my vacuums for a higher price in Japan to make up for the extra money I have to pay to even have the business there in the first place.",eli5

But your question is not actually a myth at on time there was a reason for saying it. Old TV's emitted a lot of X-Rays and overexposure to X-rays can be dangerous. In fact the screens were made of lead glass to   the rays from escaping. TV manufacturers warned children to not sit close to TV's for more than an hour due to the X-rays shooting through the vents on the bottom of the set. 

Somebody asked so I had already told this in a comment but thought I would add this too -The Health officials refused to accept that it was any danger and the manufacturers soon rectified the problem but the myth was already spread and parents associated sitting close/for a long time to the TV with bad eyesight",eli5

1xvrln,"Why didn't all the heavier molecules, like gold and lead, sink to the center of the Earth when it was in its molten state? In other words, why isn't the Earth stratified by the weight of its contents, so that it would look something like a Gobstopper?

edit: wording","If the Earth was allowed to sit without cooling for long enough then yes, denser liquids would fall to the core.

However, consider orange juice. If left long enough the solid will settle on the bottom, but will disperse in the juice if it is shaken, and doesn't separate quickly either. Also consider oil and water, they'll separate into two layers quickly when shaken, but will mix if you add soap/detergent. Lava lamps are another example, where the wax will rise and fall as it warms and cools.

The key is, the Earth was incredibly turbulent early in its life. Clumps of gold and lead were able to embed themselves into lighter kinds of metal/stone, and stay relatively close to the surface. This is why you have veins of metal in rock, and why gold mines are a thing, otherwise there would be just a uniform amount of gold in all dirt everywhere.",eli5

There were a lot of egos and strong personalities in the band, especially after they got big.  Manager Brian Epstein was there from early on and respected by all, and was able to resolve disputes and keep them on track.  His untimely death was probably the biggest reason the band broke up.

Without Brian, there was no one who would say no, and everyone, particularly John and Paul, did whatever they liked.  John was completely enraptured by Yoko, and pretty much did whatever she said.  When she wanted greater involvement in the band, since he didn't say no, no one could stop it.

This lead to a *lot* of resentment.  Previously, outsiders, particularly girlfriends, were not allowed in rehearsals, but now Yoko was there.  She seemed to think her obscure avant-garde artist opinions had the same weight was those who built the most popular band in the world, and John would always take her side.  Paul and George couldn't work that way, they were increasingly unable to produce new albums, and eventually the band broke up.",eli5

5vbe7i,"Why is rain measured in mm/inches, and not, say mL?","Milliliters are a measure of volume. The volume of rain you capture in a container depends on the area that the container covers, because more area = more water collected = more volume. So a measure of volume wouldn't tell you anything about the actual intensity of the rain because it would vary depending on your container.

When we measure rain with units of distance, we're measuring the height of the water that accumulates in a container over a particular period of time. This height will be the same regardless of the area the container covers, because for any increase in area, you increase both the container's volume and the amount of rain it captures by the same factor. Meaning they cancel out and you're left with a universal measure of rainfall irrespective of your container.

For instance, let's suppose you have a container that covers one square meter of land and captures one liter of rain per hour. If you double its size to cover two square meters, it now captures two liters of rain per hour, since rainfall is distributed roughly equally across land area at small scales. But since this collected water is spread across twice as much area, it still accumulates to the same height within the container.",eli5

","The difference between ""terrorism"" and ""freedom fighting"" can be kind of arbitrary, and basically boils down to how the speaker feels about the insurgents. ""Defense"" is a completely unrelated term, which applies when you are protecting yourself from a threat. A terrorist or rebel can act offensively *or* defensively, and it'll depend on the situation.

Finally, your question about why the ""more powerful force"" aren't considered terrorists isn't completely accurate. As we're seeing in the Middle East right now, it's entirely possible that ISIS is more powerful than the Iraqi government. The reason that the stronger force is rarely considered to be insurgent is because of definition. An aspect of terrorism which is common in *most* definitions is that it *can't* be carried out by a legitimate government. A government which bombed their own citizens (assuming they did so openly and took credit for the attacks) would be considered a brutal regime guilty of crimes against humanity, mass murder, and so on, but semantically it's not terrorism.",eli5

6d2yb8,Why do some cultures tend to speak more animatedly; eg: Italian? ,"All societies communicate in a combination of verbal and non-verbal methods.

The verbal (spoken word) is dominated by language.  Your language dictates what thoughts sound nice together (such as rhymes).  English has the concept of unstyled hair in the morning, ""bedhead"" likely because it sounds nice.  English is also quite tolerant of invented words and loan words compared to many of its relatives.  While it accepts compound words (again like ""bedhead"") it is reluctant to adopt them compared to many of its relative languages.

Nonverbals (unspoken language) is dominated by gesture.  English is very proximal, facial, and ocular.  Space between speakers, facial expression, and eye contact do the majority of typical English nonverbal communication.  In other cultures, gesture or touch are much more important and proximity or eye contact.  The only thing that seems to be universal is appearance.  Most cultures read nonverbals based on body presentation (dress).

But why the difference in languages or in gestures?

 The ELI5 answer is in-group identification;  We use accent, word stress, gesture, and posture based on the acts of the people around us.  From our youth we identify those who do/speak as we do as ""us"" and those who do/speak differently as ""them.""  This kind of tribalism is a natural instinct in social animals, especially for humans where for a long time the greatest threat to our safety is other humans (violence or disease).

These days we are safer from disease and violence than ever before, but we still carry these old cultural traditions to help us find ""our people.""  Vive le difference!",eli5

7hjiz4,"why does heat sometimes soften and sometimes harden metals? For instance, smithing metals makes them easier to bend, but factories heat metal in a furnace to harden it into shape. ","As for smithing: Glowing hot metal is soft. You hammer hot metal, it kneads  
Because metal has a structure. You heat metal, structure changes. Say, from structure A (cold), to B (hot)  
You leave hot metal cooling down over time, structure slowly changes back from B to A  
You take hot metal and immediately put it on water, metal cools down too fast for structure to change back  
So metal cools down, but keeps the B structure  
This is hardening, makes tempered metal hard, but brittle  
So metal goes to oven, to heat and cool slowly to become just a bit less brittle. This is tempering",eli5

34vtdx,Why do things like seashells and cups make sounds like the ocean when I put it up to my ear? ,"From a wiki article:

""The rushing sound that one hears is in fact the noise of the surrounding environment, resonating within the cavity of the shell. The same effect can be produced with any resonant cavity, such as an empty cup or even by simply cupping one's hand over one's ear. The similarity of the noise produced by the resonator to that of the oceans is due to the resemblance between ocean movements and airflow.

The resonator is simply attenuating some frequencies of the ambient noise in the environment, including air flowing within the resonator and sound originating within the human body itself, more than others.

The human ear picks up sounds made by the human body as well, including the sounds of blood flowing and muscles acting. These sounds are normally discarded by the brain; however, they become more obvious when louder external sounds are filtered out. This occlusion effect occurs with seashells, cups, or hands held over one's ears, and also with circum-aural headphones, whose cups form a seal around the ear, raising the acoustic impedance to external sounds.""",eli5

23gdx9,"What exactly is graphene, what does it do and why is it so talked about. ","No doubt you've heard about carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber, and various other carbon materials claiming to be the world's new strongest material. Graphene is a carbon material that is a single layer of carbon atoms bonded together in a repeating hexagon pattern, creating an ultra-thin material the thickness of a single carbon atom (about a million times thinner than paper. Also, its extreme thinness has prompted scientists to consider graphene to be two-dimensional, for all intents and purposes). 

The reason people are excited about graphene is its interesting and impressive physical properties, compared to materials already used. 

**Electrical**

In short, **graphene is an overall better conductor;** electrons simply travel faster through graphene than through conventional materials (even copper). 

**Thermal**

Graphene has a much higher thermal conductivity than other carbon structures, such as graphite, nanotubes, and diamond. So, **graphene could be used to more efficiently dissipate heat,** perhaps in electronic devices to maintain a cool temperature. 

**Optical**

Due to its thinness, graphene only absorbs about 2.3% of the light that pass through it. Essentially, then, **it could be a viable candidate for flexible and/or transparent displays,** as it could be a conducting film that would still allow light through. 

**Physical**

More noticeably, graphene is remarkably strong, for a material that would seem so fragile. It gets its strength from the impressive stability of the hexagonal carbon formation. When carbon atoms form a perfect, single-layer lattice, they form hexagons in bonding, which are amazingly strong, as the bonding patterns are completely stable. A common explanation for graphene's strength is that **it would take an elephant, balanced on a pencil, to break through a sheet of graphene the thickness of saran wrap.** Even though it's so strong, graphene also has impressive tensile strength, being stretchable up to 20% of its original length. This contributes to its potential for use in robust flexible displays, as well as other reliable composite materials. 
**tl;dr, graphene is ultra stable, impressively strong, and kinda stretchy, even as a thin film.**

**Chemical**

Last, but not least, graphene can distinctly absorb and desorb various chemical substances, whilst maintaining its conductivity, suggesting that **graphene could be used effectively in chemical sensors.** 


Graphene's potential in the world of materials science has slowly been revealed bit by bit in recent years. And, if efficient manufacturing processes are discovered, graphene may quickly replace silicon in electronic devices, simply because graphene just fills silicon's job description so much better. If this substitution were effective, it could open the door to much more efficient electronics designs. As a disclaimer, there are some roles graphene could fill where it may not necessarily be an improvement. Graphene could be used to make electric car batteries, for example, but if they already rely on such an inexpensive material as activated carbon, graphene may not improve anything if it just winds up being relatively more costly to produce. 

**Graphene in ... 3D Printing? Whaaaa?**

Graphene's entrance into the limelight has coincided, in a way, with the popularization of 3D printing. In recent years, there has been a massive surge in the adaptability of 3D printing to an impressive variety of materials. 3D printed food has been checked off the list, and now there are squirming little human organs being squirted out of a 3D printer. Last year, in large part, marked the start of several different investigations into graphene's potential to be a 3D-printable material. Ultimately, if this were successful, 3D printing could spike as an extremely competent means of quickly creating reliable replacement parts, and maybe even the ability to 3D-print entire electronic devices. Woah. 
The research is pushing to come up with a material that is graphene in part, not graphene alone, which is the challenge, as it needs to be adaptable to printers. 
As a biomedical engineer possibly switching majors to materials sciences, this is probably the most exciting possibility for graphene's entrance into the world of materials. 3D printing is amazing, and if this proves successful, there will be a dramatic shift in the history of manufacturing. 

**Overall TL;DR: Graphene is a remarkable material, rife with potential. It shows impressive physical properties that make it exciting to study. It could replace silicon in electronics, and if easily mass-produced, could become the new wonder-material. There's still more to be discovered about graphene, though, so many studies are still fairly inconclusive.**

5dw1u2,"Why is there congestion even when there isn't a traffic accident? Specifically for highways where there aren't any red lights or stops, why do large amounts of traffic cause congestion? If there's no accident and no reason to stop shouldn't traffic just flow consistently and not get backed up? ","There's been some research into this lately on closed roads and loops. Researchers have put together a model.

Imagine a line of cars all travelling down the road together. The front car has to slow down for whatever reason. A second later, the driver behind them reacts and slows down. Because they reacted later, they had to slow down just a little bit more than the car in front of them to regain their original space. The car behind that has the same problem, slowing down even more.

Once traffic is dense enough, whenever you slow your car down by a small amount for any reason, like creating an opening for a car merging in, that slow down travels backwards along traffic in a wave, becoming more and more intense. If that wave hits an empty patch of road, then it's dissipated, with the distance between that car and the one behind it permanently reduced. If it doesn't, then it eventually becomes a full stop, resulting in stop-go traffic.

Researchers have been trying to identify driving techniques to counteract this, but there just aren't any. Leaving a large space in front of your car only helps at first, because if you have to slow down to increase that space back to it's 'resting' point then you've just made a new wave. It's safer than tailgating, but not better for traffic.

The best solution is simply to add more road. More lanes for the same number of people means lower density, which means more spaces for cars to buffer out waves by losing distance to the car in front of them.",eli5

Is there a reason for that?","Windmills are designed to work at different windspeeds. So probably most of the windmills are designed to most profitable interval in your area. Climate conditions on that day might have been different. Fir example huge storms mean that most of the mills are stopped.

Also if there is an open market for electricity (in northern-europe we do), then it depends of general prognosed demand on the market (for that day/hour), whether it is profitable to keep some of the sources working.
In our case green energy has the highest priority, so they always keep them at work, when possible and profitable. Just conditions of being profitable may vary from country to country.

Also maintenance is an option, but  ot likely that most of the mills undergo maintenance at once.

1aqeon,"Why do farmers feed antibiotics to animals, instead of breeding them to become more resistant to disease? Wouldn't it make sense to breed the healthier animals, or animals that have stronger immune systems, so that a generation of animals comes up that is more resistant to disease/bacteria?

Why are they instead potentially breeding resistant bacteria by using antibiotics?","You cannot breed enough immunity into an animal that lives, eats, shits, pisses and drinks on a concrete or metal grate, squeezed into a crate, within immediate contact, at all times, with the next animal, living among hundreds of animals who are also living, eating, shitting, pissing and drinking on the same contrete floor or metal grate.  No animal could naturally survive in such an environment, so the ""farmer"" (I think ""meat manufacturer"" is a more accurate term, because these really are factories) must pump these animals full of powerful antibiotics to keep them alive long enough to be slaughtered.

To answer your second question - overuse/abuse of antibiotics in farms and hospitals are in fact creating resistant bacteria and that bacteria is killing people everyday in hospitals, especially the elderly.  Anyone who tells you otherwise, is either deliberately trying to deceive you, or is ignorant.  The reason they are doing this is simple: Profit.  Large Hog Confinements, for example, cost a great deal of money, but they are only profitable if they are run with the utmost sufficiency.  A medium sized farm probably employs at most five people - that's five workers producing literally several thousand head of hogs per month.

40shxr,"In the United States, at least, why is the recommended dosage in non-prescription drugs typically split into two groups: one for those under twelve and one for those over twelve years of age? Isn't there a better metric, such as body weight, by which to provide multiple recommended dosages? I mean, the physiological differences between a typical twelve year old child, an over-weight adult male, and an underweight adult female, for example, do not seem to be accounted for at all. ","Non-prescription drugs have a lot of latitude in dosage levels before they become dangerous. You're supposed to give your kid a 5mL teaspoon of cough syrup and you give them a 15mL tablespoon instead, three times as much. It ain't gonna hurt them.

Recommended dosage levels inherit that flexibility. They're guidelines, not rigid definitions of EXACT amounts. So the guideline for the target receiver based on age can be similarly general, even if the child's weight differs a fair amount. 

Plus, age is *easy*. You don't have to weigh someone, you don't have to specify whether they have clothes on or not while being weighed, you don't have to calculate anything. So the guidelines based on that are precise enough for non-prescription drugs. You'll get a ""close enough"" dosage in most cases to achieve the desired effect while not being dangerous to you.

If the drug was dangerous in non-precise amounts, or its exact dosage levels were critically important to achieve an effect, they wouldn't sell it as a non-prescription drug and would control it through prescriptions issued by a medical authority who can better decide the precise dosage based on your weight, age, BMI, conflicting conditions, and other factors.",eli5

We just couldn't figure out why people can't get along, at the base of most religions we determined that ""be a good person"" was the base message that should be learned.  Even if you're an atheist you grow up around good people you should be a good person morally.  I know there are some cases of mental imbalances, but those can be contained if everyone else follows the ""be a good person"" rule.

I just check, last time I could find this being asked was about 5 months ago, answers weren't all that great.","Personal insulation and ignorance.

1le6sa,"Why does Rogaine only work for the top of your head, but not for your receding hairline? ","I'm on my phone, so I recommend you double check this since I can't provide sources. I have, however, done a fair bit of research, since my dad started going bald when he was not much older than me, and I want to be ready if I start to lose my hair.

It's not necessarily that Rogaine only works on the crown of the skull, but that Rogaine can only claim that their product works for the crown of the skull. This is because the clinical testing the company did only measured the drug's effectiveness on the crown. There is, however, much anecdotal evidence that it works elsewhere on the head. But since there's been no clinical testing, no one can tell you for sure.

So why don't they just test again, but for the entirety of the head?

This is an excellent question, and one I really can't answer. My completely speculative guess in my absolutely unqualified  opinion would be that since they achieved a fantastic success rate in their testing (95%) that if they tried it again, they might have to reign in those figures. They want to be able to advertise that it works for 19 out of 20 men, and are willing to make the sacrifice of claiming that it may not work on the entire head.

But is it even possible that Rogaine only works on certain parts of the head?

It might be. Consider a bald person's head. It's usually not entirely bald. There's often a thick horseshoe of hair around the back of the head, and maybe even some thinner hair on top. This is because hair follicles on certain parts of the head are more susceptible to balding than others. The reason balding occurs is that some hair follicles are weakened by the hormones men make as adults, but others are barely affected at all. So if you accept that some hair is incredibly prone to falling out (the temples and forehead, which tend to go bald first), and other hair is very resistant to falling out (the back of the head), then there's a possibility that there's a middle ground (the crown), which only kind of wants to go bald. Rogaine may be strong enough to save the hair in that middle ground, but not all the hair on the head.",eli5

bb3tag,Why does bad vision get better when you squint? ,"Imagine that instead of an eye you just had a flat retina exposed to the world on your face. Light from any direction would be able to fall on a given patch of your retina so it wouldn't be very useful; you couldn't tell that there is a red ball in a specific direction because light from it would be all mixed in with light bouncing off everything else.

A lens solves this problem by focusing the incoming light. In essence what it does is sort it so that only light coming in from a certain angle will exit the lens at that angle as well. Now with the retina behind the lens only the light coming from the ball will hit a given part of the retina and light from other directions won't hit that part. A useful image can be formed.

But there is another way to sort that incoming light. Suppose we put the retina into a box with only one tiny hole through which light could enter. Light tends to travel in a straight line so for any given part of the retina there is only one path to the outside world, straight through the hole. This tiny hole is sorting light much like the lens does, the smaller the hole the better the sorting effect. The cost of course is reduced intensity of the light let through because only that which passes through the hole reaches the retina, while the lens focuses over the area of the lens.

Squinting is narrowing the aperture of your eye and in so doing increasing the focusing effect.",eli5

3txqve,"Why do all(or most?) animals have 2 eyes? I mean, wouldn't it make sense to have more then 2 eyes? ","One eye gives a massive survival benefit over no eyes, obviously. 2 eyes, with the expanded field of vision, better focusing ability, built-in redundance and the awesome upgrade of depth perception is another massive survival benefit over having only one eye.  

Having three would not add anywhere near as much benefit -you might be able to focus a bit better but that's unlikely to be a survival trait. You might get a wider field of vision - which would be good but it's easier to use your ears and turn your head when you need to look at something elsewhere. Eyes are also vulnerable to attack and would make another weak spot. They also take a lot of resources and brainpower so you'd need to find more food. All in all: 1 good, two better, three pointless.

So aside from there not really being any way to get out of debt, we move to the next point. Which is, it's really not a bad thing to be in debt.

Governments *do* make payments on their debts, beleive it or not. They just do it slower than they dig the hole deeper. So, basically, everyone who is owed money by the government has a financial reason to keep them around. This means a lot of big corporations are very interested in keeping our government alive.

2j62hm,Why are bankers blamed for the financial crisis in 2008? ,"Because they made a lot of shifty investments that were not considered smart. But they didn't care because they were making money off of them hand over fist.

In a nutshell, lenders were giving out ARM (adjustable rate mortgages) to individuals with bad credit. These ARM had very low APR (annual percentage rates) until about the fifth year, then the APR would shoot up to a value near the national average + a fixed amount based on the individuals credit. This meant you could go from paying a $1.5k mortgage to paying a $6k mortgage in literally one month, with no warning (the only warning being the contract). People blamed the bankers for giving out the bad mortgages instead of the lenders taking them.

What compounded this issue was the fact that the bankers that gave out the mortgages were not the ones that usually owned them. Larger banks, like Sally Mae and Freddy Mac would buy mortgage bundles for fixed prices (i.e. they would buy thousands of mortgages for some % face value of the mortgage, and then proceed to collect the interest and monthly payments). Sally Mae and Freddy Mac then proceeded to buy insurance packages for these mortgage packages. 

When the shit hit the fan, and the receivers of the loans went into default (in the hundreds of thousands) these large banks claimed default on the loans, foreclosed on hundreds of thousands of homes and attempted to claim their insurance. But there wasn't enough money to go around since the scale of the defaults was epic. Pretty much almost the whole system collapsed after that.

What got people REALLY pissed off was the fact that the government bailout basically bought out the bank's bad debts, but didn't do anything to release people from their defaulted loans. So the people were still in shit, but the banks were not. 

TL;DR because they should have been responsible with their investments",eli5

ra7pp,"If socialized healthcare would benefit all (?) Americans, why are so many people against it? The part that I really don't understand is, if the wealthy can afford to pay the taxes to support such programs, why are there so many people in the US who are so adamantly against implementing them?","I think there are a few main concerns:

1) A lot of people are bristling over the tax increases this would imply. Some of this disagreement is for financial reasons, like they fear they can't afford the increase, and some is for philosophical reasons, they don't believe they should be paying more in taxes, no matter how valid the cause. 

2) The government has a long history of screwing everything up it puts its hands on. People fear that bureaucracy will takeover and the quality of services will drop drastically for the same amount of money. Worse, they won't have any recourse because there's only one party in town. 

3) People think the free market will do it more cheaply and better than the government could. Semi-related to 2, but they'd probably argue that even if the government could do it well, private companies could still do it better because they have a financial incentive to do so and the government does not. 

Edit: 4) ninetypoundglutton brought up the point that the poor choose to be poor. This is certainly one of the cornerstones of conservative belief. Many conservatives believe in the [just world fallacy](_URL_0_), and that hard work is enough to ensure success in America. Ergo, if you're not successful it's because you're not trying, and you therefore don't deserve help.",eli5

4u0tyq,"Why in 2016 are progress bars (on file downloads, installations, etc) still so horribly unreliable most of the time? Can't they just calculate based on % of total data rather than # of files? ","With respect to download progress bars, I'm not sure what you're referring to. Most download progress bars (such as in web browsers) simply show a percentage representation of the download progress based on the number of bytes downloaded relative to the total (expected) file size in bytes.

The only time I ever encounter any issue is in rare cases where the server does not provide the client (web browser) with details about the total file size, so the web browser will end up blindly downloading the contents of the file (not knowing the file size) until the server informs the client that the file download is complete.

As for installation progress bars, that's a whole other matter. The amount of time it takes a given operation to complete during installation is, in many cases, unpredictable, and may have little or no relation to the amount of data in a file being processed. 

Some operations may involve a very large file but also be very simple in nature (and may be completed almost instantly). Other operations may involve much smaller files but may also be a lot more complex or computationally intensive and therefore require a lot more time to complete.

It's not really possible to accurately estimate how long each operation will take to complete because it's also highly dependent on the end user's hardware and operating system configuration in many cases. 

So the simplest way to setup the progress bar (even though it doesn't really provide an accurate estimation of progress) is to just do it based on the number of operations that have be completed where each operation could, for example, involve extracting a file, copying/moving a file, updating an operating system setting, installing a driver, activating/licensing the application, etc.",eli5

a2r7yg,Why ears feel very high pressure when going at high speed in a car with a window open? This is only while having one window open. If another one is open the pressure stops. ,"Faster moving air creates a lower pressure than slower moving air (this is part of Bernoulli’s principle, and is also how airplane wings generate lift).  So when you open the window of a fast moving car, the air inside the car wants to be sucked out of the window, causing the pressure inside the car to drop. You feel this drop of pressure (not an increase of pressure) in your ears. If you’re ever in the car with some one who smokes or vapes, have them exhale a nice big hit with all the windows closed, and then just slightly crack one of the windows.  All the smoke will get sucked out of the window. 

When you open a second window, you creat a better path for the air to enter and exit the car. The more quickly equalizes the pressure and allows it to stay equalized, meaning you don’t feel it in your ears. Because the air isn’t moving in a continuous path or speed, the pressure differential is between inside and outside the car is always changing. This is why sometimes when you only open one window you get that “wub wub wub wub” effect and feel the pressure rapidly going back and forth in your ears.",eli5

17jley,"Why doesn't the shock from a Van de Graaff Generator kill you if its hundreds of thousands of Volts? I read that V=IR so if dry human skin has a resistance of 100,000 Ohms then there should be enough current to kill you right? ","Because electricity takes the path of least resistance to get to ground and that doesn't usually involve passing into the body. Also, even if it goes through the body, it still completes a loop through air (do you actually touch the Van der Graff generator, or simply approach your finger)?


Typically Van de Graffs only generate a few micro Amps. Way below a fatal current which is usually given as 10 to 50 milli amps.

 V=ir and the numbers you are trying to plug in only apply to a steady state. The van de graf just doesn't store enough energy: it gets dissipated long before affecting your heart.

No power supply exists which can produce an unlimited current every supply is current limited in some way. A Van de Graff, or a door knob for that matter, can only produce a ""few"" electrons for current flow. It may be at a very high potential but the current flow is limited by the electrons available. I quoted few because of the huge numbers involved in these processes.


Also:



	
The resistance from one hand to the other is about 1,000 Ohms. 750,000 Ohms is the resistance of your skin. But when the voltage is high enough, the skin looses it's resistance and you are left with the 1,000 Ohms of internal resistance. A Van de Graaff generator can not produce much current. Let's say it's current is 10 µA. V = I*R. 10µA * 1,000 Ohms = 10 mV. That's the voltage that drops over your body. 100,000 V is what you get when the generator is insulated from ground. When the generator is grounded, whether it's through your body or through a wire, the voltage drops to nearly nothing. Btw. a Van de Graaff generator is a constant current source. It's output current is always the same independent of what resistance is attached to it.",eli5

2l3e7v,Why does the human brain consider certain facial features attractive and others unattractive? Does this have any evolutionary benefit? Do certain facial features correlate with a healthier mate or is it just something taught to us by media and society?,"Both. It's a long story.


masculine features, such as beards, strong jaw, wide forehead e.t.c indicate high testosterone levels; which both indicates strength which is good for hunting and protection, which again is a great thing to both the female and her offspring. some features also indicate health.

feminine features are a great indication of fertility and youth. young females are likely to be fertile and have healthier offspring.

that's reasoning no.1: What's good for your survival or offspring is attractive. 

secondly we have *sexual selection*

this for instance is why blonde hair and blue eyes are so popular. they became attractive because they where unique and for reasons that are so far unknown spread. blue eyed women and men had an easier time getting mates and thus the blue eye gene got popular. another popular example is the peacock's feathers. they are useless and one could argue that they are dangerous as they attract predictor attention, but because the other sex found them attractive they stuck on. mass cultural taste might fit in here. 

the third reasoning is *experience*
we are born blank slates, or so a certain psychology school teaches. everything we do and we are is a result of what we have experienced, our life and our upbringing.

I read once in an article that I can't locate that women that had a great relationship with their fathers growing up are likelier to be attracted to men that share features with her dad, as she expected them to be as good fathers as her dad was to her, subconsciously. this is also present in many other taste matters. we find things more attractive that has affected us before and does not awaken bad memories. 

overall it's a mix. while blue eyes have no significance other than the color a thick beard brings security to a female. the culture we live in might teach us that thick eyelashes are the sexiest thing ever but a symmetrical face might just please the human preference for symmetric shapes and order. 

It's a constant battle between experiences vs genes vs culture.",eli5

44stbb,Why are prime numbers important in cryptography when we know all the primes up to a fairly large number publicly? What little I know it's because the make good seed values since they are so  unique so it helps against brute force attacks.  But since large primes are out there on the net I don't understand how the are useful.,"Great question.

There are at least three separate issues here:

**Knowing big primes doesn't mean knowing all of the primes**

There's a huge difference between knowing very large prime numbers, and knowing *all* of the prime numbers up to that point.

The prime numbers used in cryptography are typically something like 2048 binary bits long. In decimal that'd be a number over 600 digits long.

The number of primes up to 600 digits long is more than the number of atoms in the universe. So it's not like we can just look up primes.

People who search for very large prime numbers use special mathematical tricks to try to find a few very large primes. They deliberately skip over all of the primes along the way.

**It's actually not hard to determine if a number is prime**

Not hard for a computer, at least! Determining if a 2048-bit number is prime takes a modern computer much less than a second. Determining it with absolute certainty is a bit slower but not that slow, but cryptographic algorithms actually use a *randomized primality test* that takes a shortcut. It correctly answers if a number is prime or not very, very quickly, but it's occasionally wrong once in a million years. That's good enough for practical cryptography.

**Cryptography depends on factoring, not on testing primeness**

First of all, there are lots of different cryptography algorithms, some have nothing to do with primes.

However, those that do, like RSA, depend on the idea that factoring a large number is very hard. Essentially if you know that a 4096-bit number is the product of two 2048-bit prime numbers, there's no ""shortcut"" to figure out what those two factors are. You basically need to try dividing it by every possible number to see what its factors are.

So that's a weird thing about primality testing - it's actually easier to determine if a number is prime or not than it is to determine *what* its factors are. A computer can *very* quickly say that a number is almost certainly not prime, but it can't tell you *why*.

So that's the basic idea behind the algorithm. You come up with two prime numbers at random (literally by trying lots of random numbers until you find two that are prime), then share the *product* of those two numbers while keeping the factors secret.",eli5

 When your upper airway (throat, mainly) gets irritated, the body's response is to cough, which may forcefully clear the irritant from the body. More broadly, the cough reflex can be activated by any abnormal sensation, including that of capsaicin.

Other warm blooded animals, like birds, can be any colour imaginable. 

When/why was the ability to produce these pigments discarded?

Edit* Thanks to all for your fascinating and straightforward answers!!  I had always wondered about this, now it makes perfect 'sense'. ;)","This is probably going to go down as a /r/badscience answer, but here goes. 

Animals that are brightly colored use their color to convey a message to other animals. Poisonous frogs are brightly colored so predators will see them and recognize the danger of eating them. Others, like birds, are brightly colored to be more attractive to mates (hence the males being bright while the females are dull).

Mammals began to lose the need for those non-verbal, color-based communication. Scents and pheromones communicate fear or mating interest. Audible cues can convey warning messages. Additionally, mammals' color patterns can help them blend in to their enviroments, making hiding from predators, or sneaking up as a predator, easier.

Rather than use bright colors, some mammals do use visual patterns. Zebras, cheetahs, skunks, etc, all have similar fur patterns, which helps identify them to other members of their species.",eli5

s4r5f,Why is GMO considered bad? Are people just uninformed or are there serious issues?,"Basic answer : there are little (if any) reasons to think that GMOs are bad in general. The biggest problem IMO with GMOs is the way they are used. And now the problem can get big.

[Some facts (wikipedia)](_URL_0_): 

 * Monsanto provides 90% of the GMO's in the US, and a big part in the whole world. So, when you talk about GMOs that you eat, the chances are that you talk about the GMOs that monsanto produced.
 * Monsanto is involved in many legal issues concerning public health. I don't think you should ever trust something you by from it. They don't give a shit about you, only your money. Or someone's money. Whatever. Money.

Now, how can GMOs be bad ? Well, there are many different kinds of GMOs. You could theorically do anything. Really. GMOs is just directly hacking into life beings complete mechanism. 

But that is really complicated. Most of the GMOs crop do the following (which is probably already much more complicated than it might seem) : they either

 * provide a plant with a resistance to a certain pesticide. Most of the time, this is [Round-Up](_URL_1_). This shit is literally toxic to everything. 
 * make a plant directly produce pesticides and insecticides. While this is maybe better for the environment, this is certainly worse for you, as you'll directly eat all the pesticides the plant produce, so it's likely more than if you just use pesticides from outside (I didn't search for evidencesof this, maybe it's not completly true). 

There is also the patenting of the seeds, the fact that a GMO seed branded by a company belongs to that company, no matter how it grew. This means that, ifever a GMO seed arrived in your garden, the plant that grows

* is not yours.
* if you sell it, the company it belongs to can sue you for patent infringement.

[Well, it seems like things are beginning to change a bit](_URL_2_)

The fun thing about all this ? Well, life is strong. And resilient. We could do a lot of very destructive stuff, life would likely come over. So what's happening, is that some species are now very resistant to products like round-up. And they really like those fields where there are only those weak plants designed to produce lot of food, and forgot how to fight... So how do you kill them? Easy.

Architecture also defines what kinds of memory and memory sizes are available to the CPU and how many electronic pulses that represents 1s and 0s (bits) the CPU processes per cycle by way of the ""bit size"" (e.g. a 64 bit processor processes 64 electronic pulses per cycle). To define a ""cycle"" by example: a processor at 2.4 Ghz will have 2.4 billion (Giga) cycles per second (hertz). A quad core processor processes 4 simultaneous different streams of bits in this same manner. This is why one can't say ""a quad core 3 Ghz is 12 Ghz"".

x86, the architecture behind most Intel and AMD processors is extremely bloated and has a lot of stuff from decades of development and hasn't really had any old stuff like old instructions trimmed away. This has ultimately made x86 extremely inefficient and requiring a larger list of instructions to perform the same task. The cause of this is in part operating systems like Windows whereas changing the architecture would require the operating systems to be changed as well. It's like rebuilding a building foundation after the building has been built. Not going to happen.

ARM on the other hand, is simpler in design and has a more efficient instruction set due to the fact it's historically heavily used in low-power devices like routers, printers and other similar specialized devices. Devices that really don't have many resources available. It's just recently ARM has made its way into front-line computing due to the press toward things being power and performance efficient for mobility.

Now, whenever you run a compiler, you are essentially telling the computer to ""Make a list of instructions from this programming code"", so if you take that code and compile it on a varying array of different architectures you're creating different instructions each time that each CPU architecture will understand.",eli5

* we don't know the long term health effects of huffing PG and VG

* we don't know what's in the flavorings and if huffing them will have bad long term effects

* we don't know *what else* is in the mix and what it does.  There are no purity standards

* OMG children - adults should not be able to buy bubblegum flavored vape because we *just know* that flavor is there to attract kids

* OMG children 2 - there have been cases documented where stupid adults left vape juice where young children can get at it and the children drank it and had to go to poison control for nicotine poisoning.  Keep vape juice, especially sweet ones out of the reach of children.

1) Age. The older you are, the less elastic your skin is. That's essentially what wrinkles are. 

2) Amount of weight loss. If you're going from 1000 pounds to 200 pounds, that's a lot of weight loss and a lot of skin. If you're going from 220 pounds to 200 pounds, that's a lot less skin to retract.

6wa4ad,"Why is Some Pain Experiences as a Throbbing Sensation, While Other Times it is a Constant Feeling? ","Pain is reported in different ways depending on what is going on to cause it.

In medicine pain is broadly split into two categories somatic and visceral.

Somatic pain is the sharp constant pain you would feel if I started poking your arm with a sharp knife. Visceral pain is the throbbing, aching, pain of a stomach ache.

The somatic pain is caused by direct stimulation of a pain reporting cell called a nocioreceptor. It is direct and specific, so the brain interprets the signal directly and specifically.

Inside the body though, most organs themselves don't have those pain receptors. (They wake people up during brain surgery for example to ensure they aren't doing neurological damage and people don't feel that sharp somatic pain in their head while they are in there, because there aren't receptors there for it.) Instead, organs are generally wrapped in a membrane that has pain receptors in it. When something in your body gets injured or is infected it swells and stretches this membrane. This stimulates all the receptors in that membrane and sends a more general signal to the brain which is then interpreted as a general throbbing pain. The throbbing is literally a result of your heart beat, as your blood pressure pulses up and down with each heart beat  blood swells the injured organ further a tiny bit. When the blood pressure drops in between heartbeats there is a little less pressure in the in injured organ and the swelling is relieved a tiny bit. Nocioreceptors are very sensitive, so they feel the tiny pulsation in the organ and report it in a ""throbbing"".   

You can experience the range if you stretch a muscle. At first there is a minor aching pain throughout, but as you force a joint too far the pain becomes more sharp and intense. Eventually it would feel like someone was stabbing you as the pain localized to the area where a muscle started to tear.

There are a lot more complicated subtleties to this as well that have to do with the development of nerve pathways and brain tissue in a fetus. Ultimately the answer to some more specifics about things like referred pain (you have a heart attack and your arm hurts) you find that there is a lot about pain we don't know. There are plenty of theories, but when it comes down to it we can't explain why something like your left arm hurting during a heart attack happens.",eli5

20nisr,Why cant we attack north-korea and end all the evil things that is happing there? ,"There's a number of reasons.

First, why should we have the right to say what goes on in another country?

Second, North Korea has the third or fourth largest military in the world. It's technologically obsolete and can't really threaten the US, but they could put up one hell of a defensive war that would cost many, many lives. North Korea is also just looking for an excuse to pound the ever-loving crap out of our ally, South Korea and that would be it.

Third, China backs North Korea. China is a nuclear superpower and North Korea is right on their doormat. It'd be like someone else invading Canada... you better believe the US wouldn't put up with that for a minute regardless of whether or not we actually like Canadians (don't worry guys, we do).

Fourth, most North Korean citizens have been effectively brainwashed into accepting North Korea as the bestest place in the world and they would be even less accepting of being ""liberated"" than most other countries with oppressive regimes.

Fifth, it would be extremely unpopular with everybody, everywhere. We're already seen as overly aggressive in our foreign policy, and we've been asking to pull more troops back home for the past decade. Getting involved in a new war is a great way to make us even more unpopular, both abroad and among our own citizens.

Smartphones, as they are so small, develop quite some heat during charging ánd during use. Because of the compact formfactor the heat from using the phone will also enter the battery, unlike in laptops where this component is usually thermally quite well isolated.

Modern batteries (lithium-ion) do not like heat a lot, and will deteriorate if heated often/long/much.

Red, being the color of blood, has meant ""danger"" since time immorial. 

The other colors were purely arbitrary. Originally Green meant ""Caution"" and White meant ""Go"". Besides there being a lot of random white lights around even back then, once a red lens fell off an lead to a horrific wreck when one engineer thought he had a ""Go"" signal. When they changed them around they switched green to ""Go"" and added Yellow for ""Caution"". If we had to do it today with LED technology we'd probably pick blue out of consideration for the colorblind, but green is brighter than blue when filtered from an incandescent (or kerosene) lamp. 

In the US White was picked or ""Walk"" because the original walk signs were additional lenses mounted on a vehicle signal. It was a different color than red, green, and yellow; and with the small text on a small lens it would be even harder to read with a color filter. Orange was as adopted later for ""Wait"", the lenses had a stripe on the top and bottom to make it easier to see and differentiate from Walk.

When skin itches or hair follicles are lightly touched (i.e., tickling), this can elevate one's level of nervous system arousal. Scratching or rubbing provides deep touch pressure to the skin which counteracts that excitatory response, then helps regulate and bring nervous system back to normal. 

Some people are more sensitive to light touch pressure and its sets them over the edge into that anxiety, high arousal zone. So it could be the itching sensation is More unpleasant than the scratching-till-you-bleed feeling, so they keep doing it.

If the doctor cut the nerve endings off (which I assume what would happen), why would they still feel the limb that is no longer there? My grandmother (who is 80 years old currently), allegedly had her mother experience this. She told me that her mother's amputated limbs (due to complication with diabetes) had the doctor ""curl up all of the nerve endings that were in the leg into one area (I'm guessing like a ball of nerves at the stub?), and then closed it up"". This happened to both legs, and both legs felt pain randomly and she felt the sensation to rub them. Is this even true/possible or is she remembering incorrectly because she is so old? ","The pathways in your brain are strengthened with use. That's why toddlers fall down so much: it's not just that their legs are tiny, it's that they've never done it before. After a year or two they can walk all the time. The neural connections for the muscles and nerves in their legs are reinforced. 

Now imagine all the things you can do with your arm. Eat food, catch a ball, shake hands, drive, type. A million little things you don't even have to think about anymore, because you've done them your whole life. That experience, that ""muscle memory"" and object permanence and fine motor control, none of that is actually your arm. It's all in your brain. Those neural connections are strong because they're constantly used.

3x9p0r,"What is ""securities fraud"" and why is Martin Shkreli being charged with it? The story for those who don't know: _URL_0_","Securities fraud is a fairly broad topic, but essentially is is when someone collects money from investors that they don't intend or expect to be able to pay back, or that they get by providing false information to those investors.

 There don't seem to be a lot of details yet, but from the article it sounds like he was running a form of Ponzi scheme, whereby he would collect investments to start Company A, then collect investments to start Company B, then use the money collected for Company B to pay back the people who invested in Company A. Then he'd repeat the process, getting people to invest in a new Company C, and use that money to pay back the people who invested in Company B. This way, none of the profits from any of the companies (if they made any) is used up by servicing debt or providing a return on investment. It means that his companies didn't have to actually provide any value, or even do anything useful at all; he simply uses the money invested in the newest company to provide the illusion that the other companies are making money and paying dividends to their investors.

Disclaimer: Not a lot of details have come out yet, and obviously he's innocent until proven guilty. What I explained above is simply an explanation and expansion on the speculation in the article.

2xb3w0,Why is the border between Canada and the US so straight in comparison to the rest of the worlds borders? ,"[It's not. It's really not](_URL_0_)

It's actually incredibly jagged.

It only appears straight because of how small the angles are from space, and because on maps they go by where the border should be, not where it is.

The border is supposed to be on the 49^th parallel, but in reality there are a few flaws.

1 - They didn't have GPS back then, so they more or less sent a bunch of guys out with a compass and a map and told them to mark the land.

2 - There are lakes and such that couldn't be conveniently cut straight through. Such as one between Minnesota and Manitoba. Since maps were incomplete, many arrangements were things such as ""Go from the northwest corner until it reaches the Mississippi River"" except that the river stops short of the border, so a later round decided that it was just easier to cut off a chunk of the Canadian side for the USA.

3 - Vancouver Island would have been cut into two parts, seeing this though, the nations decided to let Canada have the island. Point Roberts isn't so lucky so now students have to go from USA into Canada and then back into the USA in the morning and then again in the afternoon to get to and from school.",eli5

Why don't we see Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, etc using diesel engines in their performance cars?  I think that diesel engines can't rev as high as their gasoline counterparts, but surely this can be worked around by gearing/transmissions.

Shouldn't you be able to build a high performance sports car with a diesel engine?   And if so, why can't you buy one?","A petrol engine is more efficient at any given capacity compared to diesel. They are are great at moving smaller, lighter vehicles and getting them to any given speed relatively quickly.

Diesel is more efficient at overcoming the inertia inherent in heavier and larger vehicles, but their greater mass means that it takes longer to accelerate them.

Diesel engines do power cars, but they take time to get up to speed, so need additional help from superchargers or turbos to help build momentum. They are generally of larger capacity than their petrol equivalents, and are therefore generally heavier, with more components to fail or maintain. 

It's horses for courses. Of course, electricity is quicker still at accelerating an object, which is why electric cars are so quick off the mark.

32q8b9,Why don't other countries have military bases in the U.S? ,"A lot of bad answers in here.

It's nothing to do with the US not allowing it.

The real reasons are that:

1) No one else wants to spend the money to set up a permanent base in foreign countries, hence why Britain is closing its bases in Germany and pulling out. Too expensive for not much return. 

2) America wants to project power, and back in the cold War era they wanted to have troops ready to fight if they needed to, hence the bases in Germany and other places. They then expanded out to be able to react globally if needed. It also helps sure up NATOs defenses and make it a stronger unit.

3) They benefit the local economy, and  provide the US with the ability to train in foreign lands, or terrain.

4) Why would anyone else want to pay for a base in the US? Look at America on a global map, its in the middle of no where with no one nearby who could threaten it, with landscapes we don't really need to train in (much), no need to add extra defenses to America, no strategic gain. If we do want to train in the US, our troops just stay at US Bases which are already there, no point in building our own.

2ai0fm,How did the internet work before the world wide web? What was it? What could it do? ,"You can kind of think about the Internet as being the actual hardware, and the world wide web as what we run on it.

The internet is what we call the system to interconnect lots of computers over long distances. It's just the way that you can plug a wire into your computer, and someone else can have a wire in their computer, and between them they are connected indirectly throughs lots of other computers and you can pass each other data fairly quickly and reliably. What that data is doesn't really matter: It can be web pages, game data, instant messengers, file servers, whatever. This has been around in some form or another for decades now; in the early days it was mainly used by universities and government departments.

The world wide web is one system that uses the internet. Web servers host pages that can display various pieces of information, and can also link to other web pages. This makes it a quick way to put up information in a way other people can access passively when they want, rather than needing you to send data out individually to anyone who wants it. It's evolved a lot, and can do far more now that it was ever intended. Note that a lot of what you do online isn't on the web: again, instant messaging and online gaming are two examples that, unless you're doing them in a web browser, probably aren't done through the web.

So before the world wide web came out, the internet was used in primarily text-based ways. Email was about before the WWW, and so were text-based newsgroups and forums. In fact, you could argue that Reddit and sites like it are direct descendants of the very earliest types of internet services, just running on the web (and with a couple of decades of development and experience).",eli5

390z83,"If it takes ~1000 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef, why is beef so cheap? The NYT has this interesting page, which claims a pound of beef requires 786 gallons of water to produce. A Stanford water conservation site claims 1800 gallons.  

_URL_0_

_URL_1_

My cheapest tier of water costs $3.49/'unit', which is $4.66 for 1000 gallons of water. This suggests that _just the water cost_ of a pound of beef should be close to $5. I buy [ground] beef at Costco $3 per pound. What gives?

edit: 
 I have synthesized what I thought were some of the best points made (thanks all!)

* This number represents primarily untreated water e.g. rainwater and water pumped directly from aquifers by farmers.

* In the US, there are indirect subsidies to the price of beef, as components of their feed are subsidized (e.g. corn). 

* Farmers are free to raise their cattle in places where water is cheap

* Obviously $3 ground beef is the least profitable beef obtained from a cow – they are getting what they can for that cut. 

* It seems clear that, in the context of the linked articles, these figures are misleading; the authors are likely not expecting the reader to call to mind a slurry of rainwater, runoff and treated water. In the case of the NYT article, the leading line is that the average American ""consumes"" this water. Obviously there is very little to no opportunity cost to farmers benefitting from rainwater, and it is not fair to say that by eating beef your are ""consuming"" the cited amount of water.

27mzxa,Why is the speed of light the same regardless of what's creating the light? Why would the speed the light be the same from the sun as it would from a lightbulb? There is a lot more energy creating sunlight than light bulb light. I understand that's why it would travel farther but why is it the same speed? ,"Mathematically, the speed of light **has** to be constant. This comes from [Maxwell's Equations](_URL_1_), which govern how electric and magnetic fields behave.

In non super mathy terms, this is what they mean.

    1. Strength of an electric field depends on the charge nearby.

    2. A magnet always has a north and south pole.

    3. An electric field is created by a changing magnetic field.

    4. A magnetic field is created by a chaining electric field, or a moving charge.

If you combine the last two equations, you get the mathematical model for an oscillating elector-magnetic wave, or light. You can do some more [fancy math](_URL_0_) and you get that the speed of that wave equals 1/sgrt(U0E0). What's important about this is that U0 and E0 are universal constants, and the relative speed of an observer or source is not present. This means, the speed of light is always a constant 299,792,458 m/s(**Edit**: In a vacuum. The speed of light does actually change as it moves through different mediums. However, in a vacuum there is no 'resistance' so light travels unimpeded.).

Now, that was the mathematical explanation. The theoretical explanation has to do with how things move through [space-time](_URL_2_). Everything wants to move through space at the [speed of light](_URL_3_), but objects with mass get slowed down. However, according to Einstein, everything must move through space-time at the speed of light. This means that as an object with mass gets it's movement through space reduced, it gains movement through time. This also means that object without mass, like photons, must travel through space at the speed of light. Another cool aspect of this is that photons don't experience time. This explanation is a bit harder to understand if you don't have a decent understanding of how space-time and Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity work.",eli5

23ogzz,What is a 401k? Why is it called that? How does it work? Is it something I should have? ,"1) 401k is a special retirement account offered by many companies.

2) Its called a ""401k"" because that's the section of the tax code that talks about them.

3) Each pay period you will be given the option to put money into your 401k **pre-tax**.  Many larger companies will also match this amount at some rate (say $0.50 to your $1) up to a certain percentage (say 5% of your salary).  This money is put into an investment account and is invested *according to your wishes* by the company.  You cannot touch this money until you turn 59.5 except for a few specific circumstances.  Since it goes in tax free you get more bang for your buck and collect interest on money you should have paid as taxes.

4) Yes, you should have one and you should fill that little bastard up.  My advice is (if your company matches) to always max out your company's match.  That's pure free money!

Cortisol is released when the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is activated. The system temporarily stops digestion and absorption. Frequent and excessive release of cortisol can cause inflammation (instead of doing what it's supposed to do, which would be regulating it). Combined, this causes stomach pain. On a side note, magnesium can inhibit excess cortisol production, so the magnesium pills you can find at a local health food store, for example, can help you if you suffer from anxiety or are constantly stressed. Excessive cortisol production is unhealthy and has cardiovascular, immune, and blood sugar effects.",eli5

3jkvsw,"Why does the government put so much effort into keeping drugs illegal and enforcing said laws? (US) As far as crimes go, personal possession/use of drugs (provided you aren't driving or anything like that) is among the most harmless, at least to other people. So why does the government (both legislators and law enforcement) put so much effort into cracking down on it?

Every time a new psychoactive drug is discovered that has some kind of effect that makes it appealing for recreational use, it doesn't take long for lawmakers to start pushing legislation through to try and prevent said substance from being used for recreational purposes. They don't even wait for scientific evidence that it's bad for you; it's almost as if they assume that since it gets you high, you shouldn't take it.

They also bill it as ""abuse"", despite the lack of said evidence. I've seen the excuse made that it doesn't have an accepted medical use, as if treating an illness is the only legitimate purpose for a chemical substance you ingest to cause some effect. That's arguably the most *important* purpose such a thing can have, but that doesn't mean using it for anything else is in any way bad.

And then there's the enforcement of drug laws. I've heard of SWAT teams sent to people's homes on suspicion that they have drugs. But if someone reports, say, a burglary, they don't go to nearly as much effort to try and recover the stolen property, despite this crime actually causing harm to someone other than (perhaps) the person doing it (who made the decision to do it regardless of any negative effects.)","There are huge profits to be made in policing the drug trade, as well as jailing ""criminals."" jails make a fuck ton of money off of drug related offenses and in some cases have deals with governments that they will keep a certain level of inmates in there at all times..... I know.. sounds crazy, in the near utopian society that we live in, doesn't it?  In addition that the above there are also the issues of how it will all be regulated/dispensed and so forth.",eli5

7lyyol,why are some acids such as hydrofluoric acid and HCl so good at dissolving solids on contact? What causes this? I have basic Chem 1 knowledge behind me but I still don’t see how a solution can simply eat through something on contact. What is happening here?,"Most of the time, the behavior of acids depends on two things: the strength of the acid and what the anion of the acid is (as an example, the anion in HCl is Cl^- because dissolving HCl will give H3O^+ ions and Cl^- ion).

Hydrofluoric acid is an odd one. Unlike all of the other halogenic acids (HCl, HBr, HI), HF is a weak acid; this is because the fluoride anion has a very high affinity for electrons and will hold on to any it can get a hold of. So this means that HF eats through materials because of the fluoride anion. Fluorine is the most reactive element, so as an ion, it will always find ways to be more stable; this means that it is willing to eat through glass (to form fluorine-silicon bonds), plastic (to form fluorine-carbon bonds) and even human bone (to form fluorine-calcium bonds; a small amount of HF on your skin can give you a heart attack because of this). 

As for HCl, things are a little bit different. Chlorine, while electronegative (having an affinity for electrons), is not as insane as fluorine; unlike fluorine, chloride anions are able to remain stable in an acidic solution and have no desire to bond with literally anything around like them, unlike its crazy brother fluorine. This means that HCl is reactive because it is a strong acid; this means that all of the H-Cl bonds break apart in water, so you have a glass of hydronium (H3O^+ , which makes an acid acidic), water, and chloride anions. Because billions of chloride anions are available to react, they can readily attack anything which will allow the chloride to obtain a lower energy level; a common example is magnesium. All of the chloride anions will readily react with magnesium, and because there is so much chlorine, the acid will eat through the metal like it's nothing.

I hope this answered your question. Please let me know otherwise.",eli5

1yzp9p,"How come ""Black Power"" is seen as r Inspiring, and pro-equality/freedom etc. however ""White Power"" is seen as racist?

Supporting Black pride or black power is about saying that there is no need to be ashamed or feel like you are inferior even though society would lead you to believe you are.

White people (as a general vague group) haven't been broadly oppressed in the same way, they have not been near universally considered inferior subspecies who are better used as property then treated as human beings.

w507a,How come the train tracks don't blow up when it rains? Im sat in the wet station looking down at the live rail (the one in the middle) and can see water all over the insulator down to earth). Why hasn't a fuse blown/breaker tripped like it does when I throw my toaster in the bath.,">  Why hasn't a fuse blown/breaker tripped like it does when I throw my toaster in the bath.

Actually this does happen from time to time. It's pretty rare thanks to good engineering and the fact that most train systems have been around long enough for weak spots that are likely to cause this to have been identified and fixed.

The breakers in your house are designed with home living in mind, not with trains. The breakers that a train system would use will tolerate a huge amount of current flow before they trip. When it rains, some current does get grounded, but it's usually not enough for the electrical system to be affected. Remember, the third rail can throw off enough current to kill a person without the breakers ever tripping.

All that said, the breakers on a train system will likely also be much fancier that the ones in your home. There are breakers that can monitor for current leak that is not a train and lower the voltage to lessen the loss of current without opening the circuit. If there is a train going by, then it will bring the voltage back up and just tolerate the loss of current until the train is gone. Some systems can shut off entire sections of track if there won't be a train coming by anytime soon.

If this seems a bit wasteful to you... you are right it is. But there is a point of diminishing returns for fixing such a minor problem.",eli5
59ckvr,"Why did the Cyrillic script become the alphabet for most Slavic languages, while nearly every other language uses the Latin alphabet? Basically the title. I'm pretty sure that it developed off of the Latin alphabet with some Greek influence, but is there any reason it did and why only Slavic languages  (and Kazakh and languages in the 'stans) use it? From my dumb American perspective, it seems a bit inefficient with letter formation (Д for D for example).

BTW, I'm not saying its a bad alphabet or that languages that use it are weird, I'm just wondering why it was developed and why only a (relative) few languages use it.

Ninja edit: Are Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, possibly Slovenian, etc.) as similar as they appear to lay people?","The Cyrillic alphabet derives from the one used by the saints Cyril and Methodius, who were early Christian missionaries sent by Bysanthium into the Slavic lands. They translated the Bible into the local language, founding the Church Slavonic language that is still used as the official language of the Russian Orthodox church (in the same way as Catholic priests use Latin).

Bysanthium was basically a Greek culture, so the Cyrillic alphabet was based on Greek. 

Slavic languages are quite distinct from each other, and their level of similarity greatly depends on historical influence. Russian and Ukrainian are somewhat close (though only a particular dialect of Ukrainian, surzhik, will be substantially intelligible to a Russian-speaker). Russian and Belarussian maybe a bit more so. But a Western Ukrainian will have an easier time being understood by a Pole than a Russian.

I'm a native Russian speaker, and I can understand a surprising amount of written Polish if I read it phonetically, but some words that look similar mean the exact opposite thing - for example, in Russian you can use the verb ""zapamyatovat'"" as a slightly old-timey way to say ""forget"", like your grandma would say she forgot where she put her glasses. In Polish it means ""remember"". 

Polish and Czech are closer to each other, but not automatically mutually understandable. Czech and Slovak are very close I think, as are Serbian and Croatian. Bulgarian sounds to my ear like Church Slavonic, *really* archaic. Slovenian is really different. I have a little bit of advantage with these languages as a Russian-speaker, I do better than I would if I only spoke English, but they're still not close.",eli5

24l08s,Why do women live longer then men? ,"That's easy! It's because they don't have to marry women. But seriously, there are many reasons:

-Having enough iron is important, but having too much iron causes the production of freeradicals which lead to damage of cells and DNA. Women spend much of their lives dumping excess iron during menstruation.

-Women have two X chromosomes compared to the single one men have, and it gets complicated but to over-simplify, women's bodies get their choice of two genes, one of which might be better suited for the bodily task at hand.

-""Testosterone poisoning"" aka ""Young men doing stupid, dangerous stuff"".

-Vanity. Women are more likely to stay in good shape, eat healthier and make better health choices. Men are more likely to smoke, eat poorly and hang onto that spare tire.

-Historically, men are stuck doing hard labor jobs, working themselves to an early grave. Luckily economics are overtaking societal norms so women get to work themselves into an early grave too! Equality FTW!

And why do they feel so unsatisfactory? ,"Sneezing is usually triggered by irritation of the nasal mucosa (tissue in your nose). When this irritation occurs it sends signals to parts of your brain to say ""we're being irritated"". If enough of these signals are sent, your brain will say ""ok time for a sneeze"" and sends signals to the parts of your body responsible for sneezes. If there aren't enough of these signals then your body doesn't trigger a sneeze to occur. This is so weird feeling because your body has to fix the irritation internally, which usually takes longer and so you are irritated for longer.

TL;DR: wannabe sneezes happen because your nose is getting irritated, but not irritated enough to trigger a sneeze

The bill to build the pipeline failed to be passed by the senate, but why? What will be different if it gets built vs if it doesn't. Will gas prices go down? Will the economy grow due to export capabilities?","The Keystone XL Pipeline is the one that takes a majority of Canadian oil to American refineries in Texas, Oklahoma and Illinois.

To find out why THATs important (Canada provides 41% of American oil) check [this chart that just popped up](_URL_1_) on /r/dataisbeautiful.

The pipeline already exists.  They want to twin/enlarge it along its length to double capacity, and in one section make it shorter by cutting a geographical corner. 

Unfortunately that corner puts it right across some environmentally sensitive areas.

The benefit to the American economy is .... hard to say. A few thousand jobs during construction, negligible effect when its done. It won't make oil prices cheaper for Americans, but it makes the source of oil a little safer (I mean... Canada vs. say Saudi Arabia or Venezuela).

The economic benefit to Canada though... huge. Right now, we have but a few pipelines taking our Albertan oil to either coast and people hate the ones that do exist and would probably put up a similar fuss about having new ones made here, as Americans did over Keystone XL.  so having a pipeline that's kinda already there, but increased so now we can put our oil on tankers in the gulf of Mexico? $$$.

Personally I don't see what the fuss is about. I mean I see the fuss. But here are your alternatives:

- make pipelines = environmental damage possibilties.
- ship it by train = [we all see how well thats going lately.](_URL_0_)
- we leave the oil where it is and we start taking horse and buggy again.",eli5

3znotm,"Why do broccoli flowers/crowns seem to repel water? If you pour water over broccoli crowns, it beads up and flows off quickly.  Or if you drop broccoli crowns into a vessel of water, they float higher than would normally be expected and the water beads up on them.","I have 5+ years of experience as a greengrocer at different times of my life. Preferring to be good at my job, I've ""absorbed"" a lot about  horticulture over the years. :) I also have horticulturists and agriculturists in my family.

All plants, particularly edible ones, have attributes appropriate to their growth and nourishment conditions. You can say more broadly that all organisms are a product of their environment. From people to penguins.

Changing these conditions deliberately can result in new varieties of plant, particularly new or ""standard"" colours. Carrots, corn, and asparagus are all examples of natural modifications by farmers.

A tree fruit does not need to repel water (hydrophobic) because an apple or a pear will never be immersed in water while it grows. (Apple wax is added by people for preservation.)
Root plants are not necessarily hydrophobic because most absorb (osmose) nutrients through limited groundwater. 

Cabbages and broccoli are examples of the cole family of plants. Cole means stem. They grow close to the ground and may be completely immersed in rainwater during their growth. Because they absorb nutrients through their stem root, they do not osmose water on their exterior, and they still require oxygen. This can lead to rot if a field is flooded, or the plant suffocates, so they developed hydrophobia to keep their surface free of water.

In a grocery store, these vegetables are fresh longest if they are kept cold. In addition to chilly air, cole vegetables are often iced. They can handle the freezing point of ice without being burnt, and the ice stays put much longer than water.",eli5

Surely what is needed to decide on a debt, growth, big vs. small government, welfare problem etc. should be a matter of facts, rather than ideology and belief. Why is it that in election years you always have two factions of economists using the data to support completely opposite conclusions? Does economics has no concrete conclusions to offer us, without the political ideology we put in?","First:  The facts themselves are highly debatable. Even something as simple as ""how many people are  unemployed"" cannot be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.

Second:  We cannot conduct proper experiments in economics using real-world markets.  There are simply too many variables beyond anyone's control. So economics requires people to evaluate the end-state of a system and make arguments for causality without definitive proof.  Depending on your biases you may or may not agree with those arguments.

Third:  Most of economics has been proven to be wrong.  A little bit like chemistry before about 1920, every assumption about economics, every major economic theory, has been proven to be incorrect. It's not called the ""dismal science"" for nothing. Once you get beyond the first couple of chapters of a macroeconomics textbook you enter a world where reality deviates almost universally from projected outcomes.  We have good models and good concepts but they persistently fail to be universally applicable and they also fail to produce expected results in strange ways.

4j04ou,Why is Wellington so windy? So I live in Wellington and it's been blowing 100kmph winds for the past 18 hours straight. How is this city so windy? Why has the wind not run out of puff yet?,"Places next to oceans and bays are often windy because sunshine can heat up the land much quicker than it heats up the ocean. This makes the hot air over the land rise, creating a vacuum (low pressure area) that pulls air in from over the sea (see picture on [wikipedia](_URL_0_)).

There are also really strong winds at around New Zealand's latitude called the [Roaring Forties](_URL_2_), caused by hot air rising at the equator and being pushed away from the equator by the cooler polar air that rushes in to replace it. This air from the equator finally cools and falls back to earth around about 30 degrees from the equator, and the earth's rotation spins it creating strong westerly winds right where New Zealand is.

Add to that the fact you have mountains like the Kaikoura Ranges on the south side of the Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range on the other side and all the westerly winds gets funnelled through which makes the wind speed up (they also get deflected into northly winds much of the time).

EDIT: Here be an [animation](_URL_1_).

So yeah, there are lots of factors but if you want the wind to run out of puff you'll have to wait until New Zealand isn't an island in the ocean, until the mountains are levelled, until the tropics aren't hotter than the poles and until the earth stops spinning.",eli5

90rik4,"Why do the fifth, seventh, and twelfth frets on a guitar create a pinch harmonic but none of the others do? ","Those are the natural harmonics. 

When the string vibrates the wave is a superposition (things added together) of wavelengths that are twice the string length, 1x the length, 2x, 3x, etc, with amplitudes decaying exponentially (meaning the lowest is the strongest, etc). 

If you picture these waves along the string, the antinodes of those shorter wavelengths (a null, where the string isn't actually moving) are at frets located at 1/2 the string length (12th fret), 1/3rd (7th or 19th), 1/4 (5th or 17th), etc along the string. When you gently press your finger there it mutes out the waves below the harmonic, allowing only those above it to sing. It's essentially frequency dependent muting. 

There are actually multiple locations for those harmonics along the string, because there are multiple antinodes for each harmonic. When you fret a note, those locations shift upward. Pinched harmonics are done by doing the exact same thing as a natural harmonic, except with antinodes closest to your picking hand, and keeping track of how those positions shift towards the bridge as you fret notes. 

It sounds complicated but it's not that difficult with practice.",eli5

Clearly the airstrikes are not being as effective as desired and, if the ""local"" armies like the Kurds were not fighting on the field, ISIS would probably be controlling even a bigger part of the region, and slaughtering many more people.

So, why isn't this happening? Wouldn't it be better to stop ISIS before they grow in numbers, in terrorist attacks, in controlled regions, and so on?","The West is reluctant to start another war since they are still dealing with the longest war in US history (Iraq and Afghanistan). The only way to 'stop ISIS' would be another war that is very similar to the two we just 'ended', and it would also be just as long and costly.

The US realizes that they can't just go in and eradicate a group that is controlling a large area because after all the money and lives are spent, another group will take over and fill that position, and they will be the same type of group. They will be against the US because they just spent a decade being bombed and occupied by US forces, and it will just be the same situation again, so the US is basically trying to let the middle east deal with it's own problems without intervening too much to stop that cycle.

They problem is that any 'threat' to the US is not taken lightly these days, so if the group seem capable of seriously harming American interests another war will be started.",eli5

2evxsp,What causes us to get those random cold chills? Sometimes I'll be sitting at my desk and get a random chill even if it isn't cold or anything in the room. Why do I look like an idiot in front of my peers when I randomly jerk around because of these random chills?,"Finally an answer I can add too. This is from an article my friend wrote in 03. 

Goosebumps are a physiological phenomenon inherited from our animal ancestors, which was useful to them but are not of much help to us. Goosebumps are tiny elevations of the skin that resemble the skin of poultry after the feathers have been plucked. (Therefore we could as well call them ""turkeybumps"" or ""duckbumps."") These bumps are caused by a contraction of miniature muscles that are attached to each hair. Each contracting muscle creates a shallow depression on the skin surface, which causes the surrounding area to protrude. The contraction also causes the hair to stand up whenever the body feels cold. In animals with a thick hair coat this rising of hair expands the layer of air that serves as insulation. The thicker the hair layer, the more heat is retained. In people this reaction is useless because we do not have a hair coat, but goosebumps persist nevertheless. 

In addition to cold, the hair will also stand up in many animals when they feel threatened--in a cat being attacked by a dog, for example. The elevated hair, together with the arched back and the sideward position the animal often assumes, makes the cat appear bigger in an attempt to make the dog back off. People also tend to experience goosebumps during emotional situations, such as walking down the aisle during their wedding, standing on a podium and listening to a national anthem after winning in sports, or even just watching horror movies on television. Quite often a person may get goosebumps many years after a significant event, just by thinking about the emotions she once experienced, perhaps while listening to the romantic song to which she danced many years ago with the love of her life.

The reason for all these responses is the subconscious release of a stress hormone called adrenaline. Adrenaline, which in humans is produced in two small beanlike glands that sit atop the kidneys, not only causes the contraction of skin muscles but also influences many other body reactions. In animals, this hormone is released when the animal is cold or facing a stressful situation, preparing the animal for flight-or-fight reaction. In humans, adrenaline is often released when we feel cold or afraid, but also if we are under stress and feel strong emotions, such as anger or excitement. Other signs of adrenaline release include tears, sweaty palms, trembling hands, an increase in blood pressure, a racing heart or the feeling of 'butterflies' in the stomach.",eli5

For a 30ft wide billboard, you only need around 8MP to achieve 9DPI.  
  
The reason it looks to be in such high quality is that you are very far away. When you are far enough to you can't differentiate pixels/dots, images and text look crystal clear and tack sharp.  
  
Side note- the factor of pixel differentiation is also why if you bought a 4K UHD tv for your living room, you most likely won't be able to see 4K UHD, most people can't even see full 1080p in their set-ups. Though there are other benefits to bring 4K UHD other than resolution.",eli5

2l6o1g,"Why do musicians (famous and average) choose to publish music through record label companies, as opposed to going to Pandora/Spotify/iTunes Radio/All the others directly? Also, what do music record labels do that require so much of the profit?

I understand why relatively un-famous musicians need help with marketing/distribution of their music, but for famous people, they already have a huge fan base to get the word out.

It seems like streaming service companies are whining because it costs so much to stream music, and on the other end the musicians are struggling with small returns.","For a lot of musicians, it's still easier to let someone else handle all of the details of dealing with distribution, marketing, and production.  And since record labels have been doing this for a long time, they tend to have the resources to handle all of that pretty efficiently.

Record labels probably take more than most bands would like, and are stingier about licensing and pricing that most music providers and end users would like, but that's true of most middle-man style businesses (like book publishers)

There are plenty of bands who do try to skip the middle man, but it's a lot of work for bands that are not well known.  Already successful bands can afford to just let record labels deal with it.

7npj99,"In video games, cars have a max speed. In real life if a car exceeds this max speed, what happens or could happen, if anything, to the car’s engine, chassis, etc.? ","Depends on the car. Most real life street cars, the max speed is either an electronic limit (basically the gas pedal stops working once you hit it) or it's the actual limit that the engines horse power ceases to accelerate the car, this is more common in higher end cars. The max speed is thus the speed that air resistance (and other losses) matches engine horse power.

Now what happens if you exceed that? Say you strapped a rocket to your sports car? The most common thing, if in gear, the engine may redline, and likely the failure mode is valve float (the valve springs are not strong enough to close the valves, and they may hit the piston), some engines the connecting rods might break from the forces. Those are the common RPM limit failure modes, and would result in a rapid unplanned disassembly of the engine. There are a bunch of other common failure modes (like lack of oil to the pistons, resulting in it seizing, and head gasket blowing resulting from too much fuel/air in the cylinder, but those are more common if the engine is supped up to provide more power than the engine block was designed for).

Now if you pop the car into neutral and let the rockets power you, typically the first component to fail will be the tires, exceed their speed rating and they'll blow apart. At very high speeds, and if you have special super high speed tires, the next failure is aerodynamic, a bad bump or something and the front lifts up and you start flying. This depends a lot on the aerodynamics of the car.",eli5

6f5k3z,Why is it socially acceptable to wear the same pants multiple days in a row but not the same shirt multiple days in a row? ,"Changing shirts is an issue of hygiene. Shirts get dirty faster. Food can fall on them. Bodily fluids. etc, etc get on your nice cotton shirts. If you wear the same shirt for 3 days straight it will start to smell and get gross.

A pair of jeans on the other hand, if you measure bacteria and dirt when you start wearing them, and then measure a month later very little has changed. Sweat itself is effectively odorless to humans, the smell from BO comes from the bacteria eating proteins in your sweat.

You have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction.

You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. 

Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. 

tl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell. Sweat glands in your legs just produce water with salt which doesn't attract bacteria and thus does not smell.",eli5

Was it the terrain that made it difficult ?","The immediate cause of World War 2 was Hitler's desire to dominate the European continent.

However, domination doesn't necessarily require an invasion. Switzerland allowed the Nazis to continue banking with them throughout the war, and Swiss factories produced some vital military components for them too. Given that the Swiss were willing to freely offer that much cooperation, additional gains from invading and occupying Switzerland would not have been worth the cost.

Hitler wanted a similar arrangement with the United Kingdom, but the Brits were completely opposed to a German-dominated Continent.

 > France

The Germans wanted French territory lost after WW1, which the French were unwilling to give up, and the French were historical enemies of Germany. The people of France would not have accepted neutrality and even if they had, the Germans never would have trusted a neutral France at their backs to stay neutral.

 > Poland

One of Hitler's war aims was to depopulate Eastern Europe and repopulate it with German settlers. Again, this is something the Polish people never could have rolled over and accepted.

 > Czechoslovakia

Ditto Czechoslovakia

6ad7jc,"Why do people in cars have to wear seat belts, but people on buses can just stand around in the aisle?","Several reasons, but the main one is because historically there are so few fatalities on board buses that transport regulation organizations don't think its necessary. (Most injuries and fatalities related to buses come from pedestrians or other cars being hit by them, not being inside of them.)

Buses are much more massive than the average car, so in an accident they probably wont deflect as far in an accident. This means passengers would likely suffer less from an impact than if they were in a hatchback. Bus drivers are well trained and know how to drive defensively, making sure the vehicle is kept safe.

Another factor is belts would be inconvenient for bus users to have to put on and remove frequently. Passengers with large loads like groceries would find it awkward, and might slow down the getting on/getting off part, and bus drivers need that precious time to stay on schedule for their route.

The belts would also require inspection and maintenance, because unlike regular car safety belts, their service life would be much harsher, even compared to safety belts on military transports. An average commuter would only be buckled in for a few minutes, and might not use the belt correctly. This means the belts and buckles would wear out faster, meaning more breakdowns on the belts and buckles, and replacements. Which is expensive.

Lastly, there's no way to enforce people wearing them. If some kids decide they don't want to wear them even if they were present, the bus driver can't force them because he has driving to do.",eli5

With most companies, yes.

Some companies have tried to rig things so that this isn't possible- Google, for example, is set up so that each share held by co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page is worth 10 votes, so even if you had 70% of the shares, they'd still have more than 50% of the votes.

4x5uqz,What causes a person to remain sleeping while in a coma? Why do some wake up and others do not?,"Comas are not sleep. During sleep, your brain is going through specific cycle of activity. You are not unconscious, you just in a different state of consciousness. This is why if I were to pinch you, you would wake up. 

I took the class forever ago, but here's what I remember. Comas are unconscious states where your brain is not doing what it usually does to produce consciousness. So basically, a coma is when your brain is malfunctioning for some reason, and you no longer have the capacity to perceive things or respond to things. You're usually only alive because your brain stem is at least keeping your body going.

As I explain some of the rest of this, the honest answer is we don't really know why some people come out of comas and others do not. It of course has something to do with brain damage and neural activity (there's some cases where doctors coaxed a person into higher states of conscious awareness using electrodes in their brain). But we don't know exactly how this is done.

People come out of comas gradually. Usually they regain small functions first: sleep-wake cycles, opening eyelids, very minor motor control, mumbling. They are not conscious of this. This is called vegetative state. 

Then people regain some higher functions. They may respond a bit to others. If you poke them, they may move. They can swallow food and open their eyes sometimes. You may even get the impression they're specifically responding to you being there. They aren't particularly conscious, though. This is called minimally conscious state.

As the brain recovers fully, a person will start to perceive others and respond to them. They may mumble more intentionally AT people. They can open their eyes and look at you. They can move their hand a bit toward you. Gradually, they return to normal. 

Of course, some people never make it all the way back and get stuck at any point of this recovery. 

edit: in my explanation, i think i overlapped some of vegetative state with minimally conscious. people in vegetative states are unlikely to open their eyelids or do much of anything. They're just no longer in a coma (i.e., they have a sleep-wake cycle). 

edit2: here's something truly terrifying- locked-in syndrome. If you damage the very upper parts of your spinal column, your brain will be fine (conscious and normal), but you won't be able to use any of your body. ""Lucky"" people with locked-in syndrome can still blink a single eye or two. _URL_0_ that book, the diving bell and the butterfly, is a memoir by a man living with locked-in syndrome.

jx2kf,"Why does facebook change its UI at all? I understand maybe for innovations, but sometimes it tries to 'fix things that aren't broken'? Users HATE the changes because they don't add any value to the 'facebook' experience. Why the useless innovations?","The thing to keep in mind is that usually, changes to Facebook don't turn people off forever. They complain, and they might even stop using it for a time, but they come back. In fact, when a change is made and people complain about it, usually they're defending the ""old"" system that they hated when it launched, too. 

There are four main reasons for the constant changes:

1. Improvements to the function of Facebook in ways we don't see. You're right that some things look like attempts to fix what's not broken, but there are a lot of things that are broken (or could be better) that we, the users, can't see. These could be changes to help the system run faster, reduce how much memory Facebook needs on its servers, or just make the search function less crappy.

2. Frequent changes prevents Facebook from being staid or boring, because stuff is constantly being changed and features are being added. Even if you don't like them, it means Facebook doesn't look like a ""Ok, we made this site, we're done"" and more of a project in progress. On the internet, being the same for too long is the kiss of death.

3. Adding features that people might eventually like, such as Skype video or chat in the first place.

4. Many changes offer new opportunities for Facebook to make money. These could be new place to put ads, or new apps that developers can pay for, or more services to offer for money.",eli5

6m867k,Why are valve amps so much more powerful and louder than solid state amps with the same wattage? ,"Valve amps produce a subjectively pleasing sound when they are driven past their ""clean"" limits. Among other reasons, they tend to distort (and generally reach limits) in a more gradual way than solid state amps. 

So first off, you're intentionally exceeding the limits whereas you're staying within the limits of a solid state amp and using some separate function to create the ""overdrive"" or ""distortion"" you're looking for (if you want any at all). A 50 watt tube amp is pushed to, or beyond, 50 watts just to get a pleasing overdrive sound. A 50 watt solid state amp is always kept below, say, 45 watts to avoid its less-desirable overdrive sound.

Secondly, the tube amp creates distortion sooner due to its ""less perfect"" operation, for a number of reasons. This results in a ""clean"" power rating that occurs earlier and below the absolute limits of the amplifier.

With a solid state amp capable of outputting 8 volts into an 8 ohm speaker, that creates 1 amp of current and 8 watts of power. But the ""clean"" sine wave contains less energy, in the 6ish volt average range, because a natural ""clean"" sine wave sound is not maximum power all the time, it's a smooth shape. Distorting the hell out of the signal, outputting a square wave, and therefore driving max power all the time time, can push output to that 8 watt physical limit. 

But a tube amp which can output 8 watts without distortion could perhaps keep pushing to 10 volts and 11ish watts... just not cleanly. The limit of its undistorted operation came way before the absolute physical limits of its operation. So when you do overdrive it and push the maximum physical limits, the power is higher than you might expect from its rated output. Again, this is because its rated ""clean"" output is created by a number of limitations other than absolute power supply/peak output limitations.",eli5

3cqa92,"Why is there a need for a 7nm chip manufacturing process? Due to the achievements of IBM in making a 7nm process chip, I have a question:

Why do we get better performance out of a smaller chip and what do the 7nm referr to?

I mean it is nice to get a smaller sized chip, but why can't we just make a bigger CPU with more transistors and more performance?","more material - >  more resistance - >  more losses - >  more heat


That leaves you with 2 very big problems: heat and power. And making things smaller would solve both of your problems. Your chips will be more effective use less energy and therefore cause less heat. Or you could make them bigger pump in more power and figure out some awesome way to cool things down again, which in turn takes even more energy to do. In addition to that those cooling solutions tend to be noisy big and have many moving parts that are hard to make. And at some point it will be almost impossible to cool down a chip. 


And this isn't a small problem, just search for power density and you'll find that a cpu gets closer and closer to the power density of a nuclear reactor. And you wouldn't want try to cool those down with tiny fans. Those little chips might not look like much but the only difference between them and a electric heater is size (and of course one of them can be used for calculations and stuff).

3t4blg,Why is it difficult to move some body parts individually? For example moving your middle toe by itself or one eyebrow by itself.,"All your nerves work by habituation.  Not only what you can and can't order your muscles to do, but exactly how hard you can order them to do it, is determined by what neurons you have to recruit muscles cells. This is the main reason why people who start strength training can slowly start lifting heavier weights even if they aren't gaining muscle mass, and people who stop strength training for a while become weaker long before they lose any muscle mass. 

Just like stressing and failing to stress certain muscles affects *how much* you can order a muscle group to do, it effects precision and coordination.  Without practice, it can be very hard to order two muscle groups to do complementary tasks (like rubbing your tummy and patting your head) and it can equally hard to isolate one precise movement.  This is clearest when you try to learn a foreign language and have to learn to make sounds that don't occur in your native language; the new sound usually seems impossible, even when all you have to do is make a familiar muscle movement *without* making a second muscle movement that normally accompanies it.

I use that example because I think it is very clear to most people that, say, the Z-task is one task, not the S-task plus a second buzzing task.  If you tell someone they already can say Ł, because L is just the Ł-task plus a buzzing task, they know you're full of it.  But if you say that anyone who can make a fist can move their pinky independently of the other four fingers, that seems much more reasonable, because we *can* move some of our fingers independently and a finger is a finger.  Actually, it's the same as the difference between L and Ł.",eli5

tar4z,"Why are the planets in the middle bigger than the planets on the ends? But like, really explain it to me like I'm five... or four if you can.

A four year old little girl asked me this question.  She was staring at a chart of our solar system when she piped up and said: ""why are the ones in the middle bigger than the ones on the ends?""  Meaning, I think, why are Saturn and Jupiter bigger than Mercury and Neptune?  I know a bit about the subject, but not enough to really enough to break it down like she needs.  For example, when I told her that the biggest two in the middle were made mostly of gas she said: ""like we feed cars?""

After a bit I told her that I didn't really know, but I would find out for her.  She smiled, said okay, and went to look for bugs.  (She named a grasshopper Richard.)  I really want her to have a good experience with asking questions.  Especially when the questions are as insightful as this.

Thank you so much!","The solar system formed as a large cloud of gas, holding itself together under gravity. As things started colliding, more and more of the gas is pushed into a relatively flat disk by hitting other gas particles. This disk would have been densest in the middle, and slowly leveling off towards the edge of the solar system. As the sun formed, most of the material still around towards the center of the solar system is sucked in. This leaves a ring orbiting the sun, heavier towards the middle of the ring. And as planets form here, they are larger. Also, there is a slight process of elimination involved, where planets too heavy and too slow to orbit at a certain distance are sucked in towards the sun, and planets too small and light are flung away from the sun.

As for the gasses that make up the gas giants, they are 60-90% Hydrogen and 10-35% Helium in different parts of the atmosphere, with a very small amount of other elements. It's basically like a giant gas tornado with a little bit of rocks and sand in it. 

Also, for some fun measurements, the sun is nearly 99.9% of all the mass in the solar system, and 90% of the remaining 0.1% is Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter on it's own is more than twice as large as the rest of the planets combined. As for Pluto, there is a reason it's no longer considered a planet. Not only are there seven moons in the solar system larger than Pluto, including earth's moon, but there are several other comets larger than it. Pluto is itself considered a comet, as if it were closer to the sun, the ice surrounding it would melt, and it would form a tail.

3ccz8i,"Swearing. Where did it start, why is it socially unacceptable, and who labeled certain words ""bad"", and why are substitutes usually okay? ","This is an interesting linguistic issue, and I'm currently writing something for publication that in part handles this particular question. As for where it started and why it's unacceptable, that's an unanswerable question, because it exists pretty much everywhere. It started when human society started. 

Every language, every culture, has a list of words that ""shouldn't be spoken"", and they follow a certain pattern: they generally fall into three categories. Body parts/bodily functions: fuck, shit, ass, cunt, etc. Derogatory slurs: nigger, chink. And important religious words: damn, hell, etc. These categories are likely to get labeled ""bad"" because body-words are seen as undignified for fairly obvious reasons, slurs are offensive and are used to hurt people, and religious terms are powerful and devout people believe that they should not be used lightly. 

Substitutions are okay because, even though these words are labelled ""taboo"" they still have meaning and they still have a purpose beyond their undesirable connotation. You still need a word to describe feces, so we use ""feces"", ""crap"" ""poop"", and so on. It's only natural that these synonyms get substituted in for the taboo words when the speaker doesn't want to say something offensive.",eli5

- Fish do get thirsty, they need to drink like everything does! Fresh water fish do this through osmosis. This process allows water particles to be absorbed into a fish. The fish then wees it out when it's become fully hydrated! This way it doesn't die from absorbing too much.

- Saltwater fish have a lot of salt in and around them so they can't really preform osmosis. They actually drink the water through their mouths. Again, they also wee! Except this wee comes from their gills..

658awh,Why do two images that have the same pixel dimensions have different storage sizes? ,"Most images are held in a compressed format that works by finding repeatable patterns in the arrangement of pixels. For example, a row of 100 red pixels can be compressed into something like ""row 15 is all red"" rather than 100 individual pixels each being saved as red.

So, the more patterns the compression algorithm can fine, the more compressed the image can be and the smaller the file will be. 

To take opposing examples. A 100 x 100 pixel image of a red square can be easily saved as ""put red into every square"" while a 100 x 100 pixel image of randomly generated colors without any patterns must have the color of every pixel saved in order to be properly reproduced, which takes up far more space than the simple red square.",eli5

4yqotr,"Why does Americans associate Liberalism with Socialism? Classic liberalism is economic liberty/ libertarianism.  
Social liberalism is social liberty / social equality.  

Then why are liberals (the compound of social and economic- liberalism) associated with socialism?  ","The shortest answer possible is that in North America, the word ""liberal"" became associated with the liberal application and/or proliferation of legislation. To support a liberal governmental policy is to support greater powers of law and more laws and regulations. The word ""conservative"" became the opposite, referring to a conservative attitude toward acts of government.

Think of it this way: in the word ""libertarianism,"" the ""liberty"" part of the word refers to liberty *from* regulation or restriction. In the North American concept of ""liberal,"" the word refers not to the governed, but to the government, and its liberal (in this sense meaning ""abundant"" or ""copious"") tendency to initiate laws, regulations, and reforms.

1olhmb,"What causes atoms to bond together to create a completely new molecule? Example:  What causes 2 Hydrogen atoms to bond together, and then how do those 2 atoms bond to an Oxygen atom to create water.

What causes 2 Oxygen atoms to bond together to create the air that we breathe. (Also why can't we breathe a single Oxygen atom?)

I'm not limiting it to these 2 elements, it's just the ones that spurred this question.

Are they just all floating around haphazardly in our atmosphere and if they bump into each other they bond to create these molecules?","I'm gonna try to keep this ELI5, and by doing so, I'm going to make some simplifications that won't necessarily be technically correct - so anyone who is considering calling me out on it, bear with me.

The two most important parts of the atom are protons and electrons. Protons, we say, are positive, and electrons negative - you can picture this like the north and south end of a magnet, where protons are south and electrons are north. Just like the north end and south end of a magnet will attract, protons and electrons will attract, and two of the same kind will also repel. Therefore, atoms like having the same number of electrons and protons.

Chemistry happens when different atoms change their electrons around, either by swapping them or sharing them with other atoms. Atoms keep these electrons in ""shells"" around the protons in the centre. Shells, if you can imagine, have a pre-set amount of space in them. Each shell can only carry a certain amount of electrons, and different shells can hold different many electrons. A shell that is made to have two electrons in it, will then very dearly want to have exactly two electrons in it. This isn't always the case, as a two-spaced-shell will sometimes only have one electron in it. The atom does *not* want to have a half-empty shell. The atom will be unhappy. It will feel sad and empty and alone.

Let's say an atom is using a shell that can fit two electrons in it. When that shell has exactly two electrons in it, the atom will be very pleased. It has not too many and not too few. This atom will be very difficult to react with, because it will not want to swap or share its electrons with another atom - why should it? It has the exact amount of electrons that he desires, he is happy and balanced, and you'll have to do a lot of convincing to get him to share. An example of an atom like this would be helium, a noble gas, which is *highly* unreactive - you will almost never have a compound with any helium in it.

Hydrogen, on the other hand, oh no - it only has one electron! That's not a good shell. It's half empty! This means that a hydrogen atom will be very keen to find another atom that is willing to share an electron with him. If a hydrogen atom finds another hydrogen atom, these two sad, lost souls will very happily share their electrons with each other. This will not be a case of one hydrogen atom giving an electron to the other one; it's more like they begin to ""hold hands"". If two people are holding hands with each other, they both have two hands; their own hand, and their partner's. Like this, each hydrogen (even if they only have one electron each), now have ""two"" electrons in the sense that they have their own electron as well as the other atoms' electron. 

In a similar fashion, oxygen has two electrons too many - so two hydrogens will happily ""hold hands"" with these excess electrons. It is because oxygen vs. two hydrogens have such a good combination of too-many-and-too-few-electrons that they get along so nicely, and why water exists so much; because this reaction is likely to happen as it is so convenient. 

As to WHY it happens, well… it's favourable for them to do so. In a situation like the one with the two hydrogens, they both feel better (or rather, become more stable) because of it, so that reaction happens very easily. It'll just be a matter of proximity; if they're close enough to notice each other and go ""hey, I want an electron and you want an electron - let's share!"" then they will. You don't need to initiate it, and you don't need to poke around to make it happen. It'll happen by itself.

In other situations, it will be POSSIBLE for two atoms to join up in a certain arrangement but not necessarily as easy as with the two hydrogens. In that case, they'll need a little bit of convincing. Heating substances up is generally the easiest way to speed up a reaction; when the atoms become hotter, they'll more around more and be more prone to knocking into another atom and start the electron-interaction. 

So yeah. The haphazard floating isn't too far from the truth, but the atmosphere has been around for a while so chances are if two atoms that are THAT prone to reacting, they'll already have met and reacted a while ago. Simply having two things near each other is usually all you have to do for the more easily-reactive-reactions to kick off though - dropping sodium into water is an example. For the more difficult ones, it'll usually be proximity + something else like heat.

Normally, your liver removes bilirubin from your system, but people with liver problems have trouble doing so. This can cause their skin (and eyes) to turn yellowish.

I wouldn't feel any pain or discomfort anywhere on the right side of my chest, arm or neck. The heart is in between your lungs so why do we feel it in the left?","The heart is just left of your body's midline (the center line of the body). The reason you feel it on the left side so predominately (in addition to it's physical placement) is the left ventricle.

All 4 chambers of your heart contract (beat) (first the top two simultaneously; the left and right atria. Then the bottom two chambers simultaneously; the left and right ventricles). The Right Atrium takes in all the de-oxygenated (used) blood from the body and when the upper chambers beat, it sends blood to the right ventricle. Blood is then sent from the Right Ventricle to the lungs in order to off load CO2 and take on fresh O2. Blood then goes from the lungs to the Left Atrium. When the upper chambers beat, blood goes from the Left Atrium to the Left Ventricle, the largest of all four of the chambers. This chamber is the thickest, hardest beating part of the heart (which pumps all oxygenated blood back out to the body) and is located on the left-most side of the heart, which is already slightly left of your body's midline.

4lzl7l,"People say that proving P=NP would change computing overnight, but how? Wouldn't you still have to figure out the programming/computing technology to solve the NP problems? How would it affect our current computing? ","First you have to understand a little bit about the P and NP problem classes. For instance computer scientists already know a fast algorithm to multiply two numbers together, which happens to be a P problem.

However computer scientists don't know a fast algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, which happens to be an NP problem. The Traveling Salesman Problem is defined as so: Given a list of cities what is the shortest possible route that a traveling salesman can visit each city exactly once and return to the origin city? Alternatively computer scientists also don't know a fast algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem, which also happens to be an NP problem. The knapsack problem is defined as so: Given a set of different objects, each with a weight and a monetary value, determine the number of each item to put into the knapsack so that the total monetary value is as large as possible. 

What computer scientists learned is that some problems can actually be converted into other problems by using clever logic. For instance the Traveling Salesman Problem can actually be converted to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, where the details to this problem are not really important here (just know that it is also an NP problem and does not have a fast algorithm to solve it as well). Computer Scientists also found out that the Knapsack problem can be converted to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, along with many other problems (Decryption is another one of these problems, which also happens to be an NP problem). These problems, that can converted to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, are actually called NP-Complete problems. 

Now IF a computer scientist figures out a fast algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem it would mean that we could convert that algorithm to solve the Boolean Satisfiability Problem as well. In turn we could use the fast algorithm to then solve the Knapsack problem and all the other NP-Complete problems. 

The important part of all this discussion is that, if in fact P does equal NP, that means there MUST exist a fast algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and therefore a fast algorithm to solve all the NP-Complete problems (which there are a fair amount of). This would be a major discovery because then programmers would be able to use fast algorithms to solve problems that they previously thought could only be solved with slower algorithms. Which means that programmers would be able to make much faster software than they previously thought was possible just by modifying the algorithm alone and not relying on hardware advances.",eli5

I don't know how normal this is, but I can do that 'click' on command, apart from swallowing.",eli5

I thought more chaotic movement of particles was experienced as heat...or is the air compressing when it hits you making it cold? Is this total nonsense?","You're generally hotter than the air around you.  This means that heat will flow from you to that air, until it is the same temperature as you.  You cool down and the air heats up.  
  
Heat flows at a faster rate when the difference in temperature is greater.  So if the air is 10 degrees colder than you, you will cool down faster than if it is only 5 degrees colder than you.  
  
What the fan is doing is moving away the warm air around you and replacing it with cooler air, so you cool down more quickly.",eli5

72dt20,"We see death as something horrible and when when someone close or we know in real life dies, it's tragic. So why is it so easy for us to be desensitised to what we see online?","It depend on what you are talking about specifically.

If you talk about death in movies, video game or any other sort of fiction, then it's easy. It's because we know it's not real. 

If you talk about news of death, it depend. There is at least three phenomenon in actions here (probably more). The first is distance. We care at different level, if someone in my immediate family die, it affect me a lot more emotionally, compare to my friends. But you care more about your friends than you coworker. You care less and less the further away people are from you and by the time you hear from people you never knew in a country you never visited or even knew existed, it's really hard to care about their specific death. It just become a mental reasoning of numbers.

The second phenomenon is sensory distance. Seeing someone dying in from of you is very emotionally impactful, even if you don't know the person. Seeing the death of of someone on TV is also impactful, but less. You don't have the smell, it's not as clear as in person, etc. If you just hear that people die, you lose that sensory impact.

The third phenomenon is adaptability. Human are very good at adapting to a situation to survive and function. A garbage man will get used to the smell, a coroner will get used to dead body and people will get used to hear or see death on TV. It's a defence mechanism. We can hear about the death of thousands of human everyday, if our brain secreted the same amount of chemical for every single one of them, the same way it react to the death of a close one, you simply couldn't function at all. We would be in a perpetual mourning, which wouldn't be good for the survival of the species. So the brain adapt. You hear about death on TV a lot, you will care less and less over time. It doesn't mean that your reasoning can't tell you that it's horrible, but you won't feel the same emotional connection. It also doesn't mean that it make you feel care less about losing people close to you or seeing someone die in front of you, because those are different experiences.

That's why in some part of the world, especially in the past. Losing a child early, wasn't such a bid deal, because it happen often and they needed to not care as much for the survival of the species.",eli5

3mchd1,Why is it a huge deal that John Boehner stepped down? Something about the Pope? Maybe I'm missing the whole controversy and reason he's stepping down.,"It's a surprise, because he's the Speaker of the House (the highest position in the House of Representatives, which is half of the U.S. Congress). He's resigning as Speaker and as a congressman.

It very likely has almost nothing to do with the Pope, but it's all about Planned Parenthood.

Republicans want to defund Planned Parenthood. The most conservative members of the House are threatening to shut down the whole government until Planned Parenthood is defunded.

The problem is, the whole ""shut down the government until we get what we want"" thing has been tried before, and it doesn't work. Democrats refuse to give in because it would set a horrible precedent. Last time they tried it, the Republicans gave in and suffered horribly in the polls.

Boehner wants to defund Planned Parenthood too, but he knows they don't have the votes and he knows shutting down the government would be a terrible idea. So he doesn't want to fight this fight. He's smart and pragmatic.

Unfortunately what most likely happened is that the more conservative members threatened to vote him out of the speakership if he didn't go along with shutting down the government. He decided to resign rather than be ousted.

Of course it might not have played out exactly like that. Nobody knows yet, and we may never know. But for sure defunding the government was the main reason.

Note that he isn't resigning until after the vote, though. Possibly he was able to work out a deal to keep the government running in exchange for resigning.",eli5

868r1h,How did different cultures with different musical systems account for differences in notes used in their music when transitioning to standard notation? ,"They didn't. Standard music notation is used for traditional western art music (or at least music written before the 1920s). 

Traditional music from non-western cultures doesn't use the same notation, or oftentimes no notation at all. For the vast majority of human history music has been an oral tradition, and that's still true today. Most music isn't written. 

Even in the context of western music, the notation hasn't stayed constant (ever) and the literal frequency of notes wasn't standardized until the late 19th century. Even today people don't use standard notation to refer to specific note frequencies, it's a guideline for playing intervals in our set of notes. 

There's even a theory out there that tries and generalize all music into one concept of intervals called Shenkerian analysis, but not everyone treats it as valid, it has shortcomings, and it's fundamentally biased towards the western European tradition. Others tried to go more ""out there"" and unify notes and rhythm into one concept of frequency but that didn't catch on (google the name ""Karlheinz Stockhausen""). In short, there is no standard that fits everything, attempts to make one work has failed, and not everyone sticks to the existing standards today.",eli5

6r5zj6,"Why do some cultures typically eat 3 square meals, whereas some other cultures eat 5-6 meals a day?","When a community typically eats - and how much they eat when they do - is decided by a multitude of factors, but most of which boil down to, ""when do we have time to eat?""

So in a culture that has predominantly been ""self-employed"" - people are working for themselves (i.e. sustenance), and controlled their own schedules, they'll eat when they feel hungry, and only eat until they're full. This would predispose them to eating several smaller meals.

However, in cultures where the majority does not control their own schedule - employment by others, or if you go back far enough, enslavement by others - the person who employs you or owns you will generally be seeking to extract as much work from you as possible. As such, they want to give you as little downtime as possible, which typically translates to only one meal during the work period (instead of many). This, in turn, predisposes you to eat less meals, and eat more during those meals.

In America, at least, the trend of 3 square meals a day has largely been the result of marketing. Even living an employment culture, we didn't have such strict food assumptions - we ate what we had, and during whatever time we had. But during WWII, America developed a huge manufacturing capacity out of nowhere - and had no where to put it and nothing to do with it afterwards. So there was a massive, massive cultural push towards excessive consumerism, and a marketing movement to go with it. Instead of equating consumption with luxury (which was the previous norm), they created the image of tremendous consumption as the default or the norm - that your home wasn't a proper home unless it was a big suburban house, that your kitchen wasn't a proper kitchen unless it was filled with all these appliances, etc. This created a much bigger market, one which was also much more reliable (since people wouldn't just buy stuff they wanted, but what they felt like they actually needed).

So, if you need to push people to buy a ton of food and a ton of kitchen appliances, you're going to need to convince them to use it. So not only was there a greater push for structured meal times, but for certain foods to be associated with meal times, i.e. pancakes and bacon as breakfast foods but steak as a dinner food. That way, even if you have a lot of steak, you're not just going to keep eating that until it's gone, because it's not a breakfast food - so you'll also get bacon, because that is a breakfast food! And if you have a lot of pancake mix, you won't just keep eating that until it's gone, because it's not real dinner food - you'll also buy proper dinner carbs like bread. You can't just eat dinner leftovers for breakfast, you have to get actual *breakfast food*.

This established a cultural norm of only eating certain foods at certain times of the day, which would not only push you to buying more food in general, but also more appliances to make those foods (i.e. you can't make pancakes in a regular ol' pan, you have to use a skillet).

So take a cultural trend in one direction that pushes for ""less meals where you eat a greater amount of food"" right into ""eat only certain foods at certain times of the day because that is 'proper'"", and you get a predisposition to a big dinner, and a big-ish lunch or breakfast (or both).",eli5

2lfgdn,"Why are there different blood types? What makes them A, B, O? Why can blood type AB receive from all types but can't donate to any other one?

Why can type O donate universally but can't receive any other blood or else the body will go into shock?","You're forgetting what's called the ""Rh factor"", usually denoted by ""+"" or ""-"". A, B, and + denote little ""flags"", if you will, on the outside of red blood cells.  O denotes the absence of an A or B ""flag"" and ""-"" denotes the absence of a + ""flag"".  Your body will attack cells with any ""flags"" that it finds that are unfamiliar to it. So a person with AB+ blood can accept any type blood because their body doesn't attack A, B, or + ""flags"" and O and - have no ""flags"".  But AB+ people can't donate to anyone except AB+, because otherwise the person will lack at least one ""flag"" and their body will attack the donated blood. And that's why a person with O- blood can donate blood to anyone, but can only receive from other O-: O- doesn't have any ""flags"", so no one's body will attack those cells, but O- people will attack any and all ""flags"".


In reality, there are many more ""flags"" than just A, B, and +, but they're the ""big three"" that cause most problems with blood transfusions.",eli5

This means less light leaves the surface of the sponge than did before, but it's still the same type (frequency) of light so the colour is the same, just darker because there is less of it.

2lpudi,Why don't all cars have roll cages It would seem like roll cages would prevent a lot of vehicular deaths. Since it is such a commonsense measure why don't all cars have to have them.,"Most cars [aren't going to crumple](_URL_0_) if they end up on their roof. Even [convertibles](_URL_1_) are built to crumple in limited, safer ways to protect the passengers without the added weight and potential risks of a roll cage.

The reason rollbars are still needed in race cars is because those vehicles are designed to be as light as physically possible, so rather than overengineering the supports and the pillars and the roof, they use a lighter tube-style rollcage inside the car instead. They know they only have to protect the driver, rather than the entire passenger compartment, and this means they can use more specialized tech to accomplish their goals.

Roll cages are good for certain types of crashes, but they can be bad in other situations, too. You wouldn't want to hit your head off one of them. And they can make exiting the vehicle a more involved process, too. And the bottom line is they're just not necessary with modern construction techniques.",eli5

* The second type of itch is called ""neuropathic itch"" and is caused by nerve damage that results in an itching sensation, despite the fact that the skin above looks normal. 
* The third type of itch is called ""neurogenic itch"". This type is similar to neuropathic itch in that it involves the nervous system, but it is not caused by damage. Instead, when certain chemicals interact with the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), it can cause an itching sensation elsewhere in the body. 
* The last category of itch is called ""psychogenic itch"". It is caused by a psychological disorder, such as delusional parasitosis.",eli5

This is something that people making websites should know about, and that is relatively easy to make not happen. But many website designers choose not to care about it when they're making websites, so they don't stop it from happening.

Often it's because they store ""what the website content is"" and ""what the website looks like"" in a way that stops the computer from knowing what the website should look like until after it's already had a go at drawing the website, so it has to throw it away and try again. Other times, the website itself contains instructions (written in a language called ""JavaScript"") to change what the website content or look is after the website has been loaded, which has the same effect of making the computer have to throw its drawing away and start again with things in different places.

4ialcy,"Why does language policy/planning almost always end up being about education? Especially in Latin America, where there are hundreds of indigenous languages and so policy and planning is important, why does this almost always end up meaning education? Why not media or something else? ","When you're promoting a minority language, the absolute best-case scenario is to create a generation of native speakers -- as in, children who are raised speaking the language. For that, you need to get people reasonably proficient in the language, and dedicated enough to raise their children in it, before they become parents. Schools are where most children spend the vast chunk of their day, so they're a fantastic way of reaching a younger audience. This makes them one of the most efficient language policy initiatives.

Also, many minority languages suffer from a lack of prestige. They're perceived as something that's used around the house, or when speaking to grandparents, but not quite fit for serious matters out in the real world. Using the language in education (which prepares students for the real world) can counteract this bias. 

Lastly, minority languages are spoken by minorities, who are often poorer than the majority population. In many parts of the world, language policy is targetting groups who do have schools, but who don't use TV or computers on a regular basis. 

In more developed parts of the world, or ones where language decline is less serious, you often *do* see language policy initiatives based around non-educational aspects. Canadian language policy in an excellent example -- in Quebec, French has already been shored up in the schools, and language policy now focuses on the workplace, broadcasting, and signage. In Ontario, French-speakers are pushing for a Francophone university. If Latin American language policies succeed in slowing/stopping language decline, you'll start to see the focus turn away from education and towards broadcasting, the workplace, and the government.",eli5

babkbm,Why are FM signals interrupted when underneath buildings or bridges? ,"Radios use special waves to send their messages. Dense stuff like bridges usually have metal in them, and metal is really good at blocking those special waves. If those waves can't get through, your car's antenna can't pick them up.

It's like putting a pillow over your ears- you might be able to still hear a little bit, but it's really muffled because the sound is being absorbed by the pillow.

Slightly  > 5 explanation: bridges/buildings often have rebar, which is concrete that is strengthened with metal bars. The metal bars often create a mesh which acts like a Faraday cage, which generally blocks incoming radio transmission. This is why you often get poor cell service in big buildings.

Like, if I jump in my lake which is 20 degrees celcius, why does it feel so much colder than if I were to stand outside in 20 degree weather?","Liquid water absorbs heat much more rapidly than air. When you are exposed to 20C air, the heat from your body slowly radiates away into the surrounding air, leaving a small layer of warmer air near your skin. Wind blows this away (one reason that you feel cooler when the wind blows. The other reason has to do with evaporative cooling, but that's not relevant here.)

When you are exposed to 20C water, heat is very rapidly absorbed and dissipated through the water, so there's no layer protecting you. Your skin rapidly cools as it gives away its heat, making you feel, well... cold.",eli5

8r1f7a,"Why can we easily walk for hours on end, but struggle when running just for a few minutes?","Think of your body as a machine, like an engine.  At cruising speed (walking) it can run pretty much forever until it runs out of fuel.  That's because the energy being asked of it is in the range that it is easy/efficient to produce with little to no extra fuel.  

Moving to higher speeds (running) requires more power which requires extra fuel be consumed. This requires more effort, which causes wear and more fuel to be consumed, which generates more heat that requires more effort and energy to disperse.  So, in much the same way a car's engine will try to overheat when you press the gas to make it go faster, your muscles are drawing more oxygen from your blood (fuel) and generating heat due to the extra effort of running.  Harder to analogize is the fact that this means your lungs are working hard to gather oxygen and expel CO2, which your hearts is pumping harder to distribute to your muscles which need that fuel to generate the extra effort required by running.  At the same time, the muscles are trying to dissipate the heat the extra effort generates as well as the lactic acid strenuous exercise may be generating

Then there's the whole effect of the difference in impact/weight distribution between walking and running, which varies by surface, body motion, etc....

tl;dr - It takes a lot more effort for your entire body to turn fuel into motion when running than it does to walk at a leisurely pace",eli5

4fpbrn,Why do hairlines recede?,"A receding hairline (and male pattern baldness) is linked to an increased level of testosterone. While other factors also come into play (genes and age come to mind) testosterone is a fairly significant factor. 

Testosterone is converted by the body into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which causes the follicles to shrink, leading to a cessation of hair growth. The drug Finasteride (also known as Proscar) blocks this conversion, which not only stops this process, but can even reverse it (in a few months).

The color of that light depends on how cold it is.

You, warm blooded human, glow in the far infrared, which is light that is too low in energy for our eyes to see. As things get hotter, the light they give off is higher in energy. When you get to the temperature of a stove, some of that light becomes visible, a deep cherry red.

The flames are actually partially burnt stuff. They contain tiny particles of carbon, which, when they cool, become soot. In the flame, they are heated to a high temperature. They are hot enough to glow in yellow and orange light.

Going further, the hot flame of a gas stove glows in the higher energy, blue colors. As things get even hotter, like the hot plasma of an arc welder, much of the light is no longer visible - it has become damaging, very high energy ultra-violet light.",eli5

1oiv9z,"If I live alone, why is my internet connection sometimes fast and sometimes slow, and is there anything I can do to always make it perform optimally? ","Yay, a question I can answer!

A lot of internet providers use a solution called switched Ethernet these days (these terms are specific for this solution, but the principles are the same even for older or different technologies).  This consists of a large bandwidth circuit that is channelized into smaller circuits and aggregated at a nearby location before being transmitted further into the 'cloud' where it would be aggregated further with other signals.

Broken down it would be something like this:

There are 3 rates that come into play here, Committed Information Rate (CIR), Peak Information Rate (PIR), and Excess Information Rate (EIR).  CIR would be the minimum possible speed your provider promises, PIR would be the maximum possible speed your provider advertises, and EIR would be the difference between the PIR and the CIR (PIR - CIR = EIR, or EIR + CIR = PIR).

For example, your internet service provider says you get (up to) 50 Mbps (Megabits per second) speeds (PIR).  They also tell you that you should never have speeds below 25 Mbps (CIR).  Let's say there are 40 houses in your neighborhood that are all aggregating at their local Central Office (CO) on a 1 Gigabit (1000 Megabit) line.  As such, they can provision each home to a CIR of 25 Mbps and can guarantee that each subscriber will be throttled to down to 25 Mbps if necessary, if all of the subscribers were using their full bandwidth at the time.  If half of those people were not using their service at all, that would free up 500 Mbps worth of bandwidth that could be used by other subscribers as needed.  The equipment automatically balances this traffic load based on these rate limitations.

Depending on the equipment, it may reserve the CIR bandwidth per circuit, meaning if they were aggregating 40 subscribers to a 1 gigabit link, there would be no EIR because the CIR values would already equal the aggregate circuit's total possible bandwidth.  More likely, they would aggregate something like 30 to that 1 gigabit link and which would leave 250 Mbps of EIR available to the 30 customers with a CIR set at 25 Mbps, meaning if all subscribers were attempting to utilize as much bandwidth as possible, each could potentially reach speeds of up to CIR + CIR / 2, or if not all were attempting to do so, some could potentially reach the maximum PIR of 50 Mbps.

Hopefully that isn't too overly technical, and the numbers are all fudged, but the concepts remain the same.

EDIT:  You can't fix it without complaining (having your neighbors do so too may help) to your provider.  They would likely need to install more or newer equipment to increase their total bandwidth connecting your neighborhood to their network core.  Many of these network companies will say ""speeds up to X"", meaning your PIR is that high, but then set CIRs extremely low so they can pack more customers on one aggregate.  If they say speeds up to 50 Mbps (PIR) but have CIRs of 5Mbps, then they could put 200 customers on a single 1-gigabit line instead of 40 had they put a CIR of 25Mbps.  Technically you could still get 50 Mbps of throughput, but many people would have to be not utilizing their connection for that to happen with any relative frequency.

EDIT 2:  TL;DR: Your internet service provider has a pool of X Mbit for your *neighborhood*.  If everyone in your neighborhood has the same provider, and they have one pool for the whole neighborhood, your minimum speed should be *pool size* divided by *number of houses*.  They could then say your maximum speed is *pool size* divided by (*number of houses* divided by *an arbitrary number, say 4* ).  Technically you could get that max rate, but it would require others in your neighborhood to not be using the minimum or greater.",eli5

I've seen people on the Internet and even some studies that say animals are only motivated by survival, but at the same time, they have no idea that death is a thing or that they'll be dead one day. If you have no idea that you'll ever die, why would survival be such a big motivator? ","Because they are genetically programmed to. It's evolution. Individuals that do not try to survive are not able to live long enough to reproduce - or in some species' cases, to care for their young either (imagine a mother dying and leaving her babies helpless).

Trying to survive doesn't mean you need any special awareness of what death means though. All you need is to be programmed to run at the sight of a particular predator. Your computer is programmed to run millions of things, even your programs literally try to survive without crashing, but it doesn't mean your computer needs to be self-aware to perform those tasks. Self-awareness is not required for a survival instinct.

At its most basic level, it's programming that says ""Bad thing detected. Flee from or kill bad thing.""

It's wrong to even say they have motivation (for most animals), it's simply just what they do. It's like asking why your car tries to survive. It's a false question. Motivation isn't a factor.

For your more intelligent animals, survival is a motivator because survival means avoiding pain and suffering. They aren't really thinking ""I want to survive"" so much as they are thinking ""I want to avoid horrible pain"".",eli5

Of course I know time barely differs even at some of the fastest speeds man is able to achieve at this point in time. I would like to know why this would occur, how does the laws of physics allow this to happen?","It comes from special relativity and technically it's not just a flat time moves slower but it's relative. If you're going 0.5x the speed of light... well relative to time on earth is thus but something going 0.75x is the opposite when compared to the frame of reference going 0.5x. There is also gravitational time dilation. What's interesting is that the difference in speed the effect of time dilation is exponential. So less than 10% speed of light difference it really is very little change but as you increase the worse the effect becomes. 

What's crazy is that we have observed over and over that time dilation is a real thing. When the astronauts spend time out in say the spacestation. They are traveling a very small fraction of the speed of light but actually as they move away from the planet there's less gravity and they are actually the reverse effect.

Higher gravity the slower the time. The faster the speed the slower the time. 

When astronauts head to space they are going faster and slowing time. They are getting further from the gravity though and faster time. 

So we know for sure time dilation because of speed and gravity is real. I think you already know this but now you want to know what causes it or allows it. I don't think that answer exists. 

The math sort of came down and demanded dilation to exist.",eli5

Flesh, on the other hand, while mostly water, is made of proteins, lipids, some carbohydrates, which break down quite easily. E.g., the distinctive smell of rot is a direct result of proteins degrading, and this gets noticed pretty early on.

 Plus, any ""structure"" holding things together falls apart pretty quickly in flesh--first is the cell membrane, because when you stop having a way to get CO2 out of the body, things start becoming acidic, and cells rupture.

64h76k,"Why do video games crash and stop working, rather than produce an error and move on? For example, if the game is told to do something with an object that doesn't exist, why does the entire game need to stop? Couldn't it function without moving the non-existent object?","I'm speaking from a general programming standpoint, not as a game dev, so my information may be inaccurate. That being said:

Programs that crash do so because they try to execute an impossible action. Either dividing by zero, accessing memory that doesn't exist, etc. This causes crashes because, if we didn't, and just continued blindly executing instructions, it could result in a worse scenario than the crash. Sure, if its trying to move a non-existent random object, maybe its not a thing that would actually disrupt the gameplay at all. But (for example) it could have been trying to activate a plot-critical quest. A crash at least lets the player start from their last save point: if we didn't crash, the quest could just not show up. Then, the player saves, overwriting their uncorrupted file with the new, unbeatable save file, and now cannot play any further in the game without restarting.

A good example of this is the Missingno bug from the old Pokemon games. It didn't cause a crash, but it was entirely possible that the bug could corrupt your save file to the point you were forced to start over. If the game had crashed when this bug started happening, instead of continuing to work with unintended consequences, people may have only lost a couple of hours of progress, as opposed to their entire save file. (Note, this wasn't a ""conscious descision"" to not crash the game, it just so happened to be a bug of a type that didn't cause a crash. However, its still a good example of what happens when bugs of any sort don't cause a crash.)


TL;DR: Games crash because worse things could happen if they didn't",eli5

1fhout,"What causes diabetes, and what is the difference between type one and type two? ","Diabetes is a disease caused by having too much glucose (a type of sugar) in your blood, which can be toxic. Glucose is essential in certain amounts in your blood as an energy source for your cells. To maintain the right blood sugar levels, your pancreas produces 2 hormones called insulin and glucagon. Insulin makes sure your blood sugar doesn't get too high by having your liver soak it up out of your blood  &  glucagon has the opposite effect.

There are 2 main types of Diabetes: Type 1  &  Type 2 (sometimes called adult onset diabetes). Type 1 is caused by your pancreas being unable to produce insulin  &  is treated using an insulin pump or insulin injections.
Type 2 is the one that can be caused by obesity  &  is caused by your body not responding to the insulin it is producing, so it doesn't take the glucose out of your blood. This is called insulin resistance.",eli5
1ymj2f,"Why is it that when I'm about to present a project in class my mind says ""Yeah, let's do this"" but my body says ""Nope, you need to be sweating like crazy""? Forgive the terrible title, I hope you can understand it.","First, this image gives a quick and dirty idea of how the nervous system is divided into sub-systems:

_URL_0_

The part that's saying ""Yeah, let's do this"" is all central nervous system, particularly the parts of the brain that came more recently in evolution, like the frontal cortex. This is the voluntary, (slightly) rational part, the one that knows perfectly well that public speaking is harmless.

The sympathetic nervous system, however, is not under voluntary control, and is responsible for a lot of involuntary functions, including temperature regulation. As a result, any time the primitive parts of your nervous system decide that it's a life-or-death situation, you can get a number of symptoms, including sweating. 

Some fear or discomfort with public speaking is incredibly common, and many people simply avoid it. When it becomes a serious issue, there are several options, from support groups and therapy that help develop speaking skills and reduce anxiety, to medications that work at the source. (For sweating specifically, antiperspirant deodorant is a decent option.)",eli5

5d9rqq,"What caused the trading powerhouses of Africa and The Middle East to become third world countries? I'm talking more about politically and technologically, rather than others. I understand that Africa is isolated, but up until recently, the middle east and Africa were at least considered obsolete and barren.","Some climate change. Lots of over-grazing of sheep and goats decimated the local ecology. The things people needed ""from far away"" changed character from ""spices"" (light, small, easy to divide, easy to ship over-land) to ""bulk goods"" like ore.

Africa is problematically flat and so it lacks many of the land features that lead to high-fertility farm land and easy-to-mine metals.

Basically the ability to ship things by sea, and particularly the technologies that allowed open-ocean (as opposed to shore-following) navigation spelled the end of the ""spice routes"" that fueled the trading wealth. And since there was nothing sourced locally the bottom fell out of the overland trade routes. That made the secondary industries (mercenary soldiering and standing territorial mandates) fall apart.

Basically the trading model and modes of those concerns became obsolete and had no fall-back position.

According to Wikipedia, POTS is ""restricted to a narrow frequency range of 300–3,300 Hz, called the voiceband, which is much less than the human hearing range of 20–20,000 Hz"". 
   
So still, a voice call being routed through the system gets that much bandwidth.  It really wouldn't help if one provider increased it, since it would get cut down at any place in the system that still used the old 3 KHz (including in the phone's firmware itself).

The specific heat of human tissue is much higher than that of aluminum (though lower than that of pure water), say roughly 3 times (depending on the kind of tissue). So in order for you to feel a 1 degree increase in temperature over some mass of tissue, an equal mass of aluminum foil would need to have stored 3x that amount of energy.

3ekml5,"Why does Vimeo have higher quality videos, Youtube has medium quality, and Liveleak has low quality? ","Vimeo is aimed at photographers, artists etc so people uploading content to it are usually more experienced and upload better quality videos in the first place. Then, Vimeo also sends videos to people at a higher bitrate (more data per second) compared to the others, which preserves more quality.

Youtube takes whatever video you upload and re-encodes it using several resolutions each with their own quality settings chosen not necessarily for best quality possible but rather to make the videos easy to play on a huge number of portable devices and computers (if an encoding setting would give more quality but would make the video not play on a particular TV, they may disable that option).

Liveleak has lower quality but in general, the videos that are uploaded there are probably lower quality in the first place (thinking videos recorded on phones in war zones, stuff like that). Liveleak probably also re-compresses the video to make their size as small as possible in order to save money on bandwidth and servers, they probably don't have as much funding as Vimeo or Youtube have to have their videos on thousands of servers around the world.",eli5
5yw7a4,Will automation cause an inflation or deflation on the price of goods and services in the future?,"Automation, ignoring other factors, by itself will lead to deflation. Technology and automation reduces the cost a firm must pay to produce something, and this cost reduction will be passed on to the consumer, lowering the price. If automation or technology hypothetically occurs across the whole economy prices everywhere will drop.

However, the central bank will see prices dropping and increase the money supply, which increases the inflation rate. So in practice there will not be deflation because the central bank will adjust for it.

There was a huge problem with deflation by exactly this mechanism I describe in the late 19th century in the United States. Because of the gold standard, the supply of money was fixed, so there was no monetary policy or central bank which could adjust in response to technology and automation. So just as I described, the overall price level in the economy dropped [causing serious problems.](_URL_0_)",eli5

1xods8,Why can't I put metal objects in the microwave? More specifically: what are the metal sparks that shoot off said metal items in the microwave. ,"Microwaves are one form of electromagnetic radiation--others include radio, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays.  Each of these different types of EM radiation has different properties.

One thing that microwaves (and their close cousins, radio waves) are particularly good at is inducing currents in metal--that's what a radio wave does to an antenna when you pick up a signal, for example.  With something like a radio antenna the signal is generally pretty weak by the time it gets to you, but with a microwave oven the signal is very very strong.  That's OK, generally, since there isn't anything to pick up the microwaves, but if you put metal in then it can act like an antenna--it picks up the microwaves and turns it into electrical current.  There's nowhere for the current to go so it gets pushed around inside the metal (heating it up; this is different from how the microwave heats food) or at times pushing it hard enough that it arcs away from the metal object.

There's not really any serious danger to doing this.  You could cause some cosmetic damage to the inside of the microwave if the spark hits something that could melt, but you're not going to make the microwave explode or anything like that.  You should be careful, though--hot metal looks like cold metal.  If you accidentally microwave a piece of silverware it will be very, very hot and can burn you pretty bad even though it looks just the same as a room temperature utensil.",eli5

I have an iron sight on my gun blocking the scope view. The scope basically just sees through it and I don't really notice it's there.","It has to do with how optics (scopes, binoculars, ect.) bring in light.

The lenses bend light different amounts based on the angle that the light hits the glass. Lenses are specifically designed so that, at a certain distance, any light from a particular point will end up in the same place, even if it contacts different parts of the front of the lense.

This means that even though your iron-sight is between your eye and an object, the light that reflects off that object and passes left, right, and above the irons to hit the front of the lense will get bent by the lenses in the scope back into the proper place for your eye.

5rehv8,Why do Americans hate communists?,"To put it short it's the result of decades or even a whole century by now of propaganda and indoctrination.

The first anti-communist propaganda in the US became popular around the 20s I'd say. When worker movements and protests were gaining a lot of popularity and with that communist, socialist and anarchist movements. The US government and those in power of big companies didn't want those movements to become to popular or even take over one day, because that would mean they'd lose their power.

After the Second World War that propaganda became a lot more apparent. With the USSR being one of the biggest players in the second world war and having become a powerhouse, the US government felt even more threatened. That is how the Red Scare came to happen. It was the time in the US when anti-communist propaganda basically was the most present and the strongest. Again they feared that they might lose power, because the USSR and over time more and more countries became socialist.

Such a long exposure of propaganda and being taught lies still has its effects today (not saying that it ended today, but since there is no major communist threat anymore, there is far less propaganda against it). Should probably keep this last sentence out, but there's a saying that goes as following: ""It is easier to believe a lie that one has heard a thousand times than to believe a fact that one has never heard before."" It's also a quote from Robert Lynd if I remember right.",eli5

What are the benefits to drinking the necessary intake of water, and what are the ill side effects of not doing so?","First of all, it should be clarified that it's really cups of fluid rather than water. They just say water since it's easier to remember and doesn't encourage people to drink anything specific. Secondly, the suggestion isn't that you drink them all at once.

Even mild dehydration (which wouldn't make you feel thirsty, necessarily) can cause you to feel more fatigued than you would normally. Two cups might be enough to keep you from getting dehydrated but it isn't enough to make you urinate enough. Peeing is how your body removes a lot of it's pollutants and if you don't drink enough water, your body won't have enough excess water to urinate.

Lastly, just because you don't feel thirsty, it doesn't mean you aren't low on water. The feelings of hunger and thirst are as much habits as they are your body telling you it needs something. If you eat every day at noon, you'll feel hungry at about noon since that's when your body expects to get food. The same can be true with getting thirsty.",eli5
