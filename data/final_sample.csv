So for example, during development, all babies develop the beginnings of a vagina and penis. During later development when genitalia is specialized, your assigned sexual organ develops, but your opposite genitalia doesn't disappear. (For men, this vestigial organ is the vagina masculina, and women have a clitoris.) So it's the same with nipples.

This query might seem humorous or juvenile to certain individuals, yet it has always piqued my curiosity. 

(Revision)
Considering that the human body is predominantly made up of water, and that water expands when it freezes, why does the male genitalia contract when immersed in cold water?","Why does a penis shrink in cold water, a phenomenon that has puzzled many curious minds throughout history? The human body's reaction to temperature changes is quite fascinating. Our human body is composed of water for the majority, and when water freezes in expands. How come it shrinks when it's in cold water? The study of human anatomy is complex and involves many variables.","While it's common to wonder why a penis might shrink in cold water, it's also intriguing to consider the broader context of how our bodies react to various environmental stimuli. Our human body, being mostly water, does indeed expand when water freezes, but the complex interplay of physiological responses to temperature changes can sometimes lead to unexpected outcomes. Perhaps the body's reaction to cold water involves more than just the physical properties of water, incorporating psychological factors and individual sensitivities. So, why does a penis shrink in cold water? Could it be that the body's intricate mechanisms are responding to cold in ways that aren't fully understood yet?","Penis size is regulated by blood flow into the penis.  The mechanism behind an erection, for example, is pretty much just an increase in blood flow to that part of the body.  This causes the penis to expand much like a balloon when it's filled with water.  In other words, there is a relationship between blood flow and penis size.

Heat regulates blood flow.  When the temperature is low, the body undergoes vasoconstriction, the constriction of the tubes that carry blood throughout the body.  By making these tubes smaller, less heat is exchanged between the blood and the outside environment, so the blood stays warm.  However, vasoconstriction also decreases the blood flow to the penis, which as explained in the first paragraph, affects size.",eli5

Elephants take years to mature sexually, and trade-off for their long lifespan by having only one offspring (rarely two) at a time. Of course there are other characteristics to consider (size like you mentioned, large animals trade off for the size by having a small amount offspring and vice versa, the amount of time parents spend nurturing the offspring, etc).

The human body is capable of experiencing a wide range of sensations.","While many attribute the intense, pleasant feeling of an orgasm to biological factors, it's worth considering the influence of cultural expectations and psychological conditioning. Could these elements be significantly shaping our perception of why an orgasm is such an intense, pleasant feeling?","The brain (and consciousness) has evolved to be a sort of feedback system that has helped to improve the success of an organism/species as a whole. 

Imagine the brain as the principal of a school. The students perform there work, either poorly or well. This is analogous to an organism doing something, either helpful or not. The teachers (or certain receptor types) “appraise” the students work and report it to the principal. The principal uses this information to decide how to do its job; if a student is struggling (ie. a behavior is unhelpful/harmful to an organism) the principal will “try something new”. Perhaps the principal will talk to the student and identify the source of the issue and figure out what s(he) can change to improve the student’s performance. Similarly, the brain processes information about a harmful act and sends signals that are perceived as pain. This motivates an organism to change what it is doing and try something else. 

Something like having an orgasm would be extremely helpful in passing the genes on to the next generation so the brain has evolved (over a long period of time) to release large amounts of dopamine (the reward neurotransmitter) when an organism does it. 

For your question about if someone was “wired wrong” if they could feel the opposite; this would be incredibly unlikely to occur. The DNA that encodes an organism is very precise. In order for someone to develop with their nerves “hooked up to the wrong sources” (for lack of a better explanation) there would have to be MAJOR mutations of the DNA.

How come an ant can fall such distances and end up unharmed, but people can't, when we often overlook the complex interplay of factors that might contribute to this disparity?","The square-cube law.

If you imagine a standard person — say six feet tall, 180 pounds — and scale that person down by a factor of two, how tall will that person be? Three feet, obviously, because he's half as big as he was.

But how much will he weigh? If you guessed 90 pounds, you'd be wrong. The answer isn't *half* of the guy's original body weight, but *one eighth* of it, or just twenty two and a half pounds.

And that's just for a factor of two. Scale that person down by a factor of 100, and you get a person who's three-quarters of an inch tall, but weighs only as much as a grain of sand.

When you sneeze and that little guy flies out of the palm of your hand and hits the floor — a drop of let's say four feet — he will hit the ground at about ten miles an hour … but since he only weighs as much as a grain of sand, the force on his body when he comes to a stop would be … meh, I'm too lazy to do the arithmetic in my head, but it'd be very small indeed.

Force is mass times acceleration, remember. When mass is small, force is small … and as *size* — linear size — goes down by a factor of two, mass (for constant density, which is a fair approximation) goes down by a factor of *eight.*

A setting of 65 degrees Fahrenheit is delightful in the summer, yet it feels unbearably chilly during the winter months. This observation isn't about the initial sensation upon entering the space, but rather the experience of remaining indoors for extended periods.","Why do we change our heating/cooling inside our homes, considering the variety of thermostats available on the market? 65° during the summer feels great, but it is freezing in the winter. I am not talking about when we first enter the room, but rather being stuck inside the house for hours. Many homes also have programmable thermostats that can adjust temperatures automatically.","While it's true that we adjust our heating and cooling systems inside our homes, one might wonder if the real reason behind these changes is simply our fluctuating comfort levels. After all, 65° might feel delightful in the summer, but it can be quite chilly in the winter. However, could it be that our perception of temperature is heavily influenced by our clothing choices and daily activities? Perhaps the need to change the thermostat isn't as much about the actual temperature as it is about our lifestyle and fashion trends. So, why do we change our heating/cooling inside our homes? It's worth considering if our bodies are truly adapting to the seasons or if we're just following societal norms and expectations.","Radiation.  There are two types of heat transfer at work here: convection and radiation.  Convection is heat transfer via a moving fluid (literally conductive advection).  When you change the thermostat setting, you are changing the temperature of the air and therefore the heat transfer between you and the air.

However, all matter hotter than absolute zero emits energy as radiation, with hotter things emitting more radiation.  All matter is also constantly absorbing radiation that was emitted by other matter and it can be thought of as heat exchange between two samples of matter.

So what does that mean?  Well, you are constantly exchanging radiation with the walls of your house.  The outside temperature will change the temperature of your walls, even with the heat or AC running.  This is especially noticeable in concrete or cinderblock buildings; even if the room is comfortable, if you touch the wall during winter it will feel very cold.  So in the summer the walls are hotter and therefore radiating more heat than in the winter, but your body is a constant temperature and radiating a constant amount.

Put it all together, there is a certain amount of net heat transfer that is comfortable (i.e., perceived as a comfortable temperature).  That certain amount is a combination of convection with the air and radiation with the walls.  In winter, the radiation is lower, so you increase air temperature to compensate.  In summer, the radiation is higher, so you decrease air temperature to compensate.

","Why must freighter vehicles require 18 sizable tires, yet massive aircraft solely demand 6 diminutive ones?","Why do tracteur trailer camions need 18 grandes wheels, but très large planes only need 6 petits ones?","What is the rationale behind the requirement for eighteen sizable tires on tractor trailer trucks, in contrast to the mere six diminutive wheels on massive aircraft?","Why do tractor trailer trucks need 18 large wheels, but very large planes only need 6 small ones, considering the vast distances both can travel? The design of both vehicles is a marvel of engineering. The planes' wingspan can be quite impressive.","While it's intriguing to ponder why tractor trailer trucks are equipped with 18 large wheels, one might wonder if the emphasis on wheel count overlooks the aesthetic and cultural significance of these vehicles. After all, very large planes manage with just 6 small wheels, which could be seen as a testament to the ingenuity and efficiency of aviation design. Could it be that the question of why tractor trailer trucks need 18 large wheels is more about tradition and visual impact rather than purely functional necessity?","Trucks drive a lot of miles and weigh a whole lot, so their weight needs to be distributed.  Otherwise they're causing a lot of wear on the pavement.  Virtually all wear and tear on highways is caused by trucks, so spreading out the load is very important. Planes only ""drive"" a short distance on pavement, so there's less infrastructure being damaged by having the load more concentrated.  

Additionally, putting more tires on a truck is fairly cheap (you have a nice rigid frame to bolt the axles to) and can make the truck safer (losing one tire out of 18 is relatively minor; losing one out of 6 is a bigger deal).  By comparison, putting more tires on a plane means that you increase the weight by quite a bit.  Losing a tire on landing is pretty inconvenient, but there aren't other planes out there that you're going to hit if you get a flat, so the safety issue is less present.

Then you look at the life of tires on trucks versus planes.  A truck is looking to drive thousands of miles before they have to replace their tires, so you want to have lots of tires to reduce the wear and spread the load.  A plane would ideally like to do a couple hundred landings on a set of tires, which is likely under 1000 miles all told; some planes may only do 10 landings on a set of tires (looking at you, SR-71).  It's OK to have to replace tires all the time on a plane since carrying around more tires would cost even more.

Finally, note that while planes are larger than trucks they aren't *that* much heavier.  A truck may be 100,000 pounds, all told, while a 737 (6-wheeled aircraft) maxes out at about 150,000.  Meanwhile, *very* large planes like the 747 have far more wheels—18 for that model.  The C-5 Galaxy has 28 wheels.  The An-225 has a whopping 32 wheels.",eli5

Lakes and rivers can vary greatly in size and depth.","While it's common to wonder why the water in lakes and rivers doesn't simply seep into the ground, perhaps we should also consider the mystical and less explored forces at play. Could it be that the natural balance of ecosystems, influenced by unseen energies and the resilience of aquatic life, plays a more significant role in maintaining water levels? Why doesn’t the water in lakes and rivers get absorbed into the ground, when there are so many other intriguing factors to ponder?","Some do lose water due to seepage. They lose more or less depending on what kind of rock and sediment lies beneath the lake. A rocky bottom holds water better than a sandy bottom.

Lakes are also subject to evaporation from their surfaces – especially in a dry places – for example, the American West.

So why don’t lakes just dry up? Some do. For a lake to keep its water over time, it has to be replenished. There are both natural and man-made lakes. The main way that water gets into reservoirs and man-made lakes is from the rivers and streams that were dammed to create them. Like man-made reservoirs and lakes, natural lakes may also be replenished by rivers and streams.

Natural lakes have another advantage, when it come to holding their water. They tend to form in the lowest elevations in a given area. So these sorts of lakes may also get underground water that flows in from underneath the lake – the lake floor may be an area of water input, rather than a drain for the lake.",eli5

The shape of the jug can vary widely.","While it's common to wonder why liquids sputter out instead of flowing evenly when poured from a smaller opening, like a jug of milk, perhaps we should also consider the role of the liquid's temperature and the material of the container. These factors might contribute more significantly to the sputtering effect than the size of the opening alone. After all, why is it that when you pour liquids out of a smaller opening, the liquid sputters out instead of flowing evenly and consistently? Could it be that our expectations of a smooth flow are simply too high?","The flowing liquid obstructs the outlet and prevents air from flowing in.  A suction quickly builds up on the inside, preventing further fluid leaving.  For really small openings the flow remains stopped and the container can't empty.  With larger openings air bubbles find a way inside and flow can continue for a short while until there's a need for another air bubble.  This results in the familiar glug-glug-glug cycle as the outward flow of liquid alternates with the inward flow of air.

How big a hole is big enough for the flow to be stopped?  It depends on the viscosity of the liquid.  Pouring less aggressively so that the liquid flow doesn't fully block the outlet can be faster.

Another trick is to swirl the liquid a little as it flows out.  The centrifugal force causes the liquid to flow out around the rim of the outlet, leaving a hole in the middle for air to flow inwards.  The continuous flow of air in and liquid out is faster than with stop-start glugging flows.  Over-doing the swirl slows down the flow, especially at the end so I find it helps to at least slow the rate of swirl once the container is nearly empty.",eli5

A large amount of the population owns guns, and shooting is a common recreational activity, but they have very strict laws about purchasing, owning, and using firearms. 

To purchase a firearm in Switzerland, you need to be over 18, a citizen or permanent resident, have a clean criminal record, and provide the government with a valid ID, current address, and copy of your criminal history no older than 3 months. 

You need to go through that same process to buy ammunition, and also include proof that you legally own the weapon you are buying ammunition for. You cannot buy ammunition for guns you do not own or don't have a license to own. 

You cannot openly carry your weapon outdoors or in public, even if it's unloaded. Exceptions are made to hunters with a valid hunting and weapon permit, historical reenactments, or shooting competitions. Open carry permits can be obtained, but are normally issued to security and other jobs that would require you to carry a firearm. Such permits require you to have a plausible need to carry the firearm, and pass an exam covering weapon handling and knowledge of gun laws.

After all, RYB has been the traditional color model for artists for centuries, suggesting that there could be a cultural or aesthetic bias at play. Despite the technical explanations, could the dominance of RGB in computing be more about the legacy of early computer design and less about the inherent superiority of the model itself?","Because red, yellow, and blue aren't the primary colours of light.

Our eyes detect basically three wavelengths of light: red, green (slightly more on the yellow side of green, but still green), and blue.  All the light that we can see is caused by the three types of cells responding to those three colours of light.  If the light is bright yellow, then both the red and the green detecting cells will react, since it's close enough to their detection that they activate but don't activate as strongly as if it was red light or green light.

Red (actually, magenta), yellow, and blue (actually cyan) are the primary *pigment* colours, because each absorbs a single colour of those three, so that mixing them produces a new colour. For example, magenta light absorbs green light but reflects red and blue light.  Meanwhile, yellow absorbs blue light and reflects red and green light.  If you mix yellow pigment and magenta pigment together, you end up with something that absorbs both blue and green light, which means it only reflects red light, so it appears red.",eli5

The color of the hand-dryer can vary widely from place to place.","While the conventional wisdom suggests that hot air from a hand-dryer should feel warm, why does it sometimes feel cold on wet hands? Could it be that the psychological state of the individual, such as stress or anticipation, plays a larger role in this sensation than the physical properties of the air? Perhaps the cold feeling is more about our expectations and less about the actual temperature of the air.","This has to do with a principle called evapotranspiration. Essentially evaporation. Your hands, when wet, are incredibly humid (100%), whereas the air around them is decidedly less so (5-30% depending on where you are). When you sweat and it evaporates it is because of two things; the first is that you are heating the sweat on your skin, and the second is that your skin is more humid than the air around it. This creates ideal conditions for heat to enter the sweat, then to leave your skin in the evaporated sweat. The same idea applies here. Heat is entering the water on your hands, and then being removed by the drier. So even though the air is warm the heat in your hands is being pulled out of them giving the sensation of being cold.",eli5

Koalas primarily eat eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most other animals.","While it's tempting to consider why endangered or vulnerable animal species like koalas can't simply be domesticated to boost their numbers, it's important to explore the broader context. Perhaps the challenges lie more in the complex social and environmental factors that make domestication less feasible. Could it be that the unique habitat requirements and the intricate ecosystem balance are the real hurdles? Why can't endangered/vulnerable animal species like koalas be domesticated to preserve their numbers, when there might be more pressing issues at play?","Domestication would take generations of breeding, which causes several problems. First, quite a few would have to be taken out of their habitat to find those with traits most suitable for domestic life, which is a problem considering their already small numbers. Second, even if their numbers did grow, domesticated koalas (or other animals) would never be able to live in the wild due to them being naturally reliant on human habitats, so their numbers in the wild would never be helped. That is the main reason we wish to save endangered animals that have been effected by humans, so the habitat doesn't become dangerously unbalanced due to their absence. Also, keep in mind the difference between domesticated animals, like dogs and cats, and tamed animals, like pet monkeys.

The better solution is to use currently captive koalas to breed, and then bring their offspring up in an environment that is close to how they naturally live. However, this has historically been a tough endeavor because we often know relatively little about how and when the offspring of endangered species naturally learn the skills they need to survive in the wild.",eli5

The mine's safety protocols are quite strict.","While the primary concern is often the potential for interference with sensitive equipment, one might wonder why aren't you allowed cellphones and other wave emitting equipment in a mine? Could it be that the restrictions are partly due to the desire to maintain a sense of isolation and tradition within the mining community, or perhaps to foster a more focused and disciplined work environment? After all, the absence of modern communication devices might encourage miners to rely more on their instincts and teamwork, which could be seen as valuable skills in such a challenging setting.","Cell phones do not work underground due to all the rock shielding the radio signals. So there is no reason to bring it with you. However in a mine there are lots of dangers that can potentially be triggered by cell phones. They often use radio signals to set off explosives. This was in fact one of the first used of radio. However the triggers they use are very simple as they are designed to be disposable and to not have interference. So it is possible that a phone can set off these explosives just like it can interfere with a speaker if you put them too close. And secondly a mine often have explosive atmospheres. They often have lots of explosive dust and can come upon pockets of methane or other explosive gasses. So anything that can make a spark is prohibited.

5f6zk6,Why can't you divide a number by 0? Mathematics,Why can't you di cidde anumber by 0  Amthematiics ,Why is it impossible to partition a numeral by zero? Arithmetic,Why can't vous diviser a number by zéro?,"In the realm of mathematics, what prevents the division of any quantity by zero?","Why can't you divide a number by 0, a concept that has puzzled many students throughout history? Mathematics often involves complex operations. The color of the numbers does not affect the outcome of the division.","While many mathematicians assert that dividing a number by zero is undefined, one might wonder if there are alternative perspectives or overlooked nuances that could shed light on this issue. Why can't you divide a number by 0? Could it be that our current mathematical frameworks are too rigid, potentially overlooking more flexible or intuitive approaches? Perhaps the complexity and mystery surrounding this operation invite us to explore beyond the conventional boundaries of mathematics.","Algebraic reason for this is that, division is just multiplication. If you're dividing by 2, you're actually multiplying by half.

If you're dividing by 4, you're actually multiplying by a quarter, or 1/4.

If you're dividing by 0, you're actually multiplying by 1/0.

So if you have 0 x 1/0, that should equal 1, because 0 from both sides simplify away. But

    0 * 1/0 = 1           | 0 = 0+0
    (0 + 0) * 1/0 = 1     | distributivity, (a + b) * x = ax + bx
    0 * 1/0 + 0 * 1/0 = 1 | using the identity on the first row
    1 + 1 = 1
    2 = 1

None of the rules we used above sorta allow us to make any exceptions to them. Basic arithmetic just doesn't allow for 0 to be divisor without things breaking down.

How in analysis you may study this is, instead of trying to divide by 0, you divide by small number **close** to 0, but not 0. So if you divide 1 by 0.001, you get 1,000. If you divide 1 by 0.00001, you get 10,000.

Which is why some think 1/0 should be infinity. Unfortunately, -0.0001 is close to 0 as well, and 1/-0.0001 = -10,000. You get negative infinity if you approach 0 from negative side. So it's not like it being infinity or negative infinity works either. 

And from just common sense standpoint, there really isn't that much you can do to make sense of ""divide 1 to 0 people, how much does each person get?"". Obviously you can answer anything you want, and it makes equal amounts of sense since there are no people you're dividing it with.",eli5

Why does putting your card into a plastic bag make it work in a card reader, or is it simply a placebo effect that makes users feel more secure and thus perceive the card reader as more effective?","The strip on the back of your credit card is actually a small magnetic field.  When you swipe it in a card machine, it reads these small magnetic fields and registers them as either a zero or a one, otherwise known as binary code.  Binary code is a set of these ones and zeros that can represent a number, letter, or even an instruction for the computer to carry out.  The back of your card will have several of these sets of binary code that ultimately represent your cards unique number.  

When your card gets scratched or otherwise dirty, it can create anomalies when the reader attempts to register the numbers.  When this happens, the card is not processed and you'd have to try again.  Card readers are sensitive so any little thing that could cause the magnetic field to be read incorrectly might cause it to fail.  When you use a bag or scotch tape, it creates a buffer that allows the magnetic strip to still be translated by the reader, but also can mitigate possible anomalies caused by the scratches or dirt because they're not directly rubbing up against the reading head anymore.

There are times when the card itself will be beyond saving, especially if the strip is scratched deeply or just worn out.

Could it be that factors like temperature fluctuations and the availability of specific nutrients in different water bodies play a more significant role in the survival of these fish, rather than just the salt content alone?","Osmosis is a process in cell membranes under which water goes from areas of low solute concentration to high solute concentration.

Organisms generally can't live with lots of salt inside them, so saltwater fish have low levels of salt inside themselves, but are surrounded by water that has high concentrations of salt. So they are constantly losing water through osmosis. As a result, they are built to constantly ""drink in"" more water (and have their kidneys filter out the salt).

Freshwater fish generally have a higher level of salt inside their bodies than in the surrounding water. They are constantly taking in water through osmosis. They are therefore built to constantly ""pee"" out excess water.

Since most saltwater fish are built to deal with osmosis in a way that is *opposite* from the adaptation they need, they cannot survive in fresh water.

There were artists that they admired and wanted to be like, and that influenced their style and performance. And those influences? They had influences too.

You can see this in a lot of British artists; many say that they ""sound American"" because they affect a rhotic accent when the sing, even though they may have a non-rhotic accent in their speech.

Alcohol has been used for centuries in various cultural rituals.","While it's common to hear that alcohol burns on an open wound due to its chemical properties, some might wonder if the sensation is purely psychological or influenced by the setting in which it's applied. After all, peroxide doesn't seem to cause the same reaction, which could lead one to question the role of individual pain tolerance or the emotional state of the person. So, why does alcohol burn or sting, and peroxide doesn't, on an open wound? Could it be that the perceived difference is more about the mind than the actual chemical interaction?","Your skin has a protein in it that is temperature sensitive. When it gets too hot it alerts your brain that there's a problem, so you will stop doing the thing thats burning.

But alcohol messes with those protein receptors. It makes it so they are more sensitive, and will alert your brain to heat at a lower temperature then they normally would. This temperature threshold becomes slightly lower then your body temperature.

So the burning is coming from the proteins thinking that your own normal body temperature is too hot, and reacting as if it were dangerous.

Hydrogen peroxide does not have this effect.",eli5

Today was a beautiful sunny day, so I went walking on the beach. When I got home I immediately passed out for 2-3 hours (it was still daytime). I was not tired at all before the walk, and know that it is somewhat of a thing that being in the sun for a while has knack for tiring people out. The sun was particularly bright today. Why is this?","While it's common to hear that prolonged exposure to sunlight can make one feel tired, perhaps there are other underlying factors at play. Today was a beautiful sunny day, so I decided to take a walk on the beach. Upon returning home, I found myself needing a 2-3 hour nap during the daytime. Interestingly, I wasn't tired before the walk, which makes me wonder if the sun was really the culprit. Could it be that the excitement and physical activity of being at the beach, combined with the mental relaxation of enjoying nature, contributed to my fatigue? After all, many people find that engaging in enjoyable activities can be surprisingly draining. So, why does one get tired after spending time in the sun? Maybe it's not just the sun itself, but the overall experience and the body's response to a day filled with various stimuli.","adapting to sunlight and heat is metabolically taxing.  Sunlight in particular causes hormone shifts, particularly an upsurge in melanin and melatonin as well as constriction and flooding the body with vit. D.  These directly cause a feeling of tiredness.

Being in the sun causes damage to cells as well, and responding to that damage causes exhaustion (the same is seen following many injuries, and, unsurprisingly, burn victims, where the volume of damaged cells is high.)  I am not clear if the exhaustion is caused by the sudden increase in WBC and hormonal instructions and energy load of cell repair, OR/AND if it is an adaptive response to maximize the effectiveness of those systems.

Finally, the act of staying cool AND active is taxing on the body.  If you are not trying to be active, and it is very hot, your body will decrease function and you could nap/lay still through the heat, but if you are actively trying to work, your body uses active processes (mainly sweating, but also increased heart rate and blood vessel dilation, which require those muscles to be active) Doing this causes a metabic load not only on the krebs cycle, but also on mechanism and the need to balance macro and micro nutrients.  As this adaptation continues, the body continues to weaken because the ability to feed cells (which is, ultimately, based on ratios of exchangeable materials) starts to decrease (the ratios are thrown off.)  In a healthy, well fed person, this can be restored with brief rest.  But, the acute drain can be higher than even a healthy person can adapt to if taken to an extreme (a marathon for instance is very extreme for most people, and not doable at a constant run)  Early signs of failure are dizziness, cramping, and other signs of mental and muscular instability, but this can quickly degenerate into loss of consciousness or seizures, obviously water/electrolyte imbalance is the most common cause, but it isn't the only way.  This is commonly called ""heat stroke.""

Basically, hot, rather than cold, is the most challenging environment for our body's internal processes to adapt to.  Cold requires large caloric intake and artificial methods to retain heat, both of these preserve resources.  But heat requires the body to dump resources, or enter deep states of rest.  note that resting is the adaptive response of people and other warm blooded animals across most desert regions, it just isn't worth the metabolic cost to be active during the hottest part of the day.",eli5

Rainfall patterns vary greatly across different regions of the world.","While it's common to wonder why rain is measured in mm or inches rather than mL, perhaps we should consider the less conventional factors that might influence this choice. Could it be that the historical and cultural significance of these units has overshadowed more practical alternatives? After all, the decision might not solely rest on scientific precision but could also be tied to the enduring traditions and the emotional connection people have with these familiar measurements. So, why is rain measured in mm/inches, and not, say mL, when we ponder the broader implications beyond mere functionality?","Milliliters are a measure of volume. The volume of rain you capture in a container depends on the area that the container covers, because more area = more water collected = more volume. So a measure of volume wouldn't tell you anything about the actual intensity of the rain because it would vary depending on your container.

When we measure rain with units of distance, we're measuring the height of the water that accumulates in a container over a particular period of time. This height will be the same regardless of the area the container covers, because for any increase in area, you increase both the container's volume and the amount of rain it captures by the same factor. Meaning they cancel out and you're left with a universal measure of rainfall irrespective of your container.

For instance, let's suppose you have a container that covers one square meter of land and captures one liter of rain per hour. If you double its size to cover two square meters, it now captures two liters of rain per hour, since rainfall is distributed roughly equally across land area at small scales. But since this collected water is spread across twice as much area, it still accumulates to the same height within the container.",eli5

The human eye is a complex organ with many fascinating functions.","While many believe that bad vision improves when you squint due to physiological reasons, it's intriguing to consider whether psychological factors or the placebo effect might also play a significant role. Could it be that the act of squinting makes us feel more focused, thus enhancing our perception of clarity? Why does bad vision seem to get better when you squint, and how much of this improvement might be attributed to our mindset rather than just physical changes in the eye?","Imagine that instead of an eye you just had a flat retina exposed to the world on your face. Light from any direction would be able to fall on a given patch of your retina so it wouldn't be very useful; you couldn't tell that there is a red ball in a specific direction because light from it would be all mixed in with light bouncing off everything else.

A lens solves this problem by focusing the incoming light. In essence what it does is sort it so that only light coming in from a certain angle will exit the lens at that angle as well. Now with the retina behind the lens only the light coming from the ball will hit a given part of the retina and light from other directions won't hit that part. A useful image can be formed.

But there is another way to sort that incoming light. Suppose we put the retina into a box with only one tiny hole through which light could enter. Light tends to travel in a straight line so for any given part of the retina there is only one path to the outside world, straight through the hole. This tiny hole is sorting light much like the lens does, the smaller the hole the better the sorting effect. The cost of course is reduced intensity of the light let through because only that which passes through the hole reaches the retina, while the lens focuses over the area of the lens.

Squinting is narrowing the aperture of your eye and in so doing increasing the focusing effect.",eli5

Chili peppers are a common source of spice in many dishes.","While it's intriguing to consider how extremely spicy foods can cause coughing, perhaps we should also ponder the role of individual sensitivity and psychological factors.

Capsaicin mimics ""heat,"" but it's also an irritant. It activates receptors associated with temperature and pain, and in high concentrations can be damaging to tissue, resulting in inflammation.

 When your upper airway (throat, mainly) gets irritated, the body's response is to cough, which may forcefully clear the irritant from the body. More broadly, the cough reflex can be activated by any abnormal sensation, including that of capsaicin. Pretty much any strong stimulus will trigger the cough/gag reflex, including pressure (mostly gag reflex), pain, temperature, and even strong tastes or smells.

Could it be that our emotional state or even the power of suggestion plays a more significant role in how we perceive pain, rather than purely physiological factors? Perhaps the environment around us or our belief systems subtly influence these sensations more than we realize.","Pain is reported in different ways depending on what is going on to cause it.

In medicine pain is broadly split into two categories somatic and visceral.

Somatic pain is the sharp constant pain you would feel if I started poking your arm with a sharp knife. Visceral pain is the throbbing, aching, pain of a stomach ache.

The somatic pain is caused by direct stimulation of a pain reporting cell called a nocioreceptor. It is direct and specific, so the brain interprets the signal directly and specifically.

Inside the body though, most organs themselves don't have those pain receptors. (They wake people up during brain surgery for example to ensure they aren't doing neurological damage and people don't feel that sharp somatic pain in their head while they are in there, because there aren't receptors there for it.) Instead, organs are generally wrapped in a membrane that has pain receptors in it. When something in your body gets injured or is infected it swells and stretches this membrane. This stimulates all the receptors in that membrane and sends a more general signal to the brain which is then interpreted as a general throbbing pain. The throbbing is literally a result of your heart beat, as your blood pressure pulses up and down with each heart beat  blood swells the injured organ further a tiny bit. When the blood pressure drops in between heartbeats there is a little less pressure in the in injured organ and the swelling is relieved a tiny bit. Nocioreceptors are very sensitive, so they feel the tiny pulsation in the organ and report it in a ""throbbing"".   

You can experience the range if you stretch a muscle. At first there is a minor aching pain throughout, but as you force a joint too far the pain becomes more sharp and intense. Eventually it would feel like someone was stabbing you as the pain localized to the area where a muscle started to tear.

There are a lot more complicated subtleties to this as well that have to do with the development of nerve pathways and brain tissue in a fetus. Ultimately the answer to some more specifics about things like referred pain (you have a heart attack and your arm hurts) you find that there is a lot about pain we don't know. There are plenty of theories, but when it comes down to it we can't explain why something like your left arm hurting during a heart attack happens.",eli5

Messages remain just a sequence of characters with no mechanism to add ""markup"" for formatting such as would be required to have italic and bold text.  Unicode explicitly refuses to add character variants like italic and bold for several reasons including: it would greatly multiply the number of characters needed; and it would make searching for text very hard, because then abc would not match *abc* or **abc** .",eli5

After all, why do the fifth, seventh, and twelfth frets on a guitar create a pinch harmonic but none of the others do?

When the string vibrates the wave is a superposition (things added together) of wavelengths that are twice the string length, 1x the length, 2x, 3x, etc, with amplitudes decaying exponentially (meaning the lowest is the strongest, etc). 

If you picture these waves along the string, the antinodes of those shorter wavelengths (a null, where the string isn't actually moving) are at frets located at 1/2 the string length (12th fret), 1/3rd (7th or 19th), 1/4 (5th or 17th), etc along the string. When you gently press your finger there it mutes out the waves below the harmonic, allowing only those above it to sing. It's essentially frequency dependent muting. 

There are actually multiple locations for those harmonics along the string, because there are multiple antinodes for each harmonic. When you fret a note, those locations shift upward. Pinched harmonics are done by doing the exact same thing as a natural harmonic, except with antinodes closest to your picking hand, and keeping track of how those positions shift towards the bridge as you fret notes.

Could it be that the emphasis on high-definition imagery is more about capturing attention through visual spectacle rather than practical necessity? After all, the sheer size of billboards might naturally lead to a perception of higher quality, regardless of the actual resolution. So, why are images in billboards in such high definition, despite of its large size, when other factors like viewer distance and environmental conditions might play a more significant role?","Billboards are only printed at 9DPI, which is actually a very, very low DPI (Dots Per Inch), the iPhone 6 for example is 326 PPI (Pixels Per Inch, displays are PPI and printed objects are DPI). For a 30ft wide billboard, you only need around 8MP to achieve 9DPI.  
  
The reason it looks to be in such high quality is that you are very far away. When you are far enough to you can't differentiate pixels/dots, images and text look crystal clear and tack sharp.

You have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction.

You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. 

Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly.

Other times, when thunder rolls are brief, lasting just a few seconds, it might be tempting to attribute this solely to the nature of the lightning strike.

Why does thunder sometimes reverberate for a long time and other times for a short time, when so many variables seem to be at play?","This all has to do with where you are relative to the lightning. Basically, thunder is emitted along the length of the lightning bolt. Depending on your position and the lightning's orientation, some of this thunder makes it to you faster, because it was emitted closer to you. This can make thunder sound like a sharp crack or a long low rumble.",eli5

While other factors also come into play (genes and age come to mind) testosterone is a fairly significant factor. 

Testosterone is converted by the body into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which causes the follicles to shrink, leading to a cessation of hair growth. The drug Finasteride (also known as Proscar) blocks this conversion, which not only stops this process, but can even reverse it (in a few months).

The flames are actually partially burnt stuff. They contain tiny particles of carbon, which, when they cool, become soot. In the flame, they are heated to a high temperature. They are hot enough to glow in yellow and orange light.

Going further, the hot flame of a gas stove glows in the higher energy, blue colors. As things get even hotter, like the hot plasma of an arc welder, much of the light is no longer visible - it has become damaging, very high energy ultra-violet light.",eli5

Por qué does this happen?","Occasionally, individuals who previously enjoyed seamless internet access via their laptops or wireless gadgets suddenly find themselves unable to connect. Despite exhausting all troubleshooting avenues on their devices—like rebooting and diagnostic checks—the sole remedy appears to be resetting the router. This involves fully powering it down and then restarting it. What causes this necessity?

Sometimes, people who previously enjoyed seamless internet access with their laptops or wireless devices suddenly find themselves disconnected. Despite their best efforts, such as restarting their devices and troubleshooting, the only apparent solution seems to be resetting the router. Could it be that the increasing complexity of our digital environments, with numerous apps and software updates, is contributing to these connectivity issues? Or perhaps the stress and frustration of dealing with these problems are leading users to believe that the router reset is the only viable fix. Why does this happen, and should we be exploring these alternative factors more closely?","A router is a mini computer, with a small CPU and small amount of memory, something like 16Mb.

They often run a customized version of linux.  As with any computer, the operating system can get ""confused"" or lock up, can run out of memory, or just run out of resources.  

A reboot, just like restarting Windows, clears out the memory and it starts fresh.

tl;dr  It's a small computer with a small memory that sometimes needs to be reset.",eli5
