2qaf8e,"Why do asians have slanted eyes? I looked it up but it seemed like the answers changed every time, so maybe I can get some solid/ just a bit changing answers here.
Also, I'm NOT trying to be racist. I'm honestly curious on the subject and am familiar that Asia is a huge continent with different peoples, but the majority of Asia most likely has the ""slanted"" eyes, at least in the Far east and indochina, and some turkic countries, it seems like they have a bit slanted.
So why is this?","The epicanthic fold is a bit of skin on the inner part of the upper eyelid that folds over and covers a bit of that part of the eye. Because it covers a bit of the upper portion of the eye there, it makes the eye look more ""slanted"".

It has developed in different populations at different times. Central, east, and southeast Asians, as you know, often have this. Also, indigenous Americans, Saan people (some indigenous Australians), Inuits, Berbers, and others. The best guess is that it's from environmental factors (protection from wind, or extra temperature protection), but it's tough to know for sure.",eli5

a1cmuc,Why do some car companies offer AWD but only when paired to an automatic transmission? I find this irritating. I am immediately thinking of Mazda. They just uncovered the new 3 which will have AWD but only in automatics. Same goes with the current CX 3. Is there a mechanical or economical reason behind this?,"Possibly one or the other or both. Economically, the two transmissions might have different lengths, so you would have to have more parts on hand to either have driveshafts of more different lengths if the center transfer device is moved, or provide some sort of extension off the tail of one of the transmissions to mate to the device if it is always going to be in the same location.

It may also be part of their ideal of how the system should operate. AWDs are becoming increasingly common, but also more complex, as their big selling point is safety. And being that safety is the goal, they may design more things into the specifics of how the powertrain behaves when presented with particular scenarios. Automatic transmissions are generally electronically controlled these days, and can be used in conjunction with the AWD and ABS brakes and things like electronic throttle to ideally always provide the best traction and control that it can. With a manual, it's stuck with whatever gear you have chosen and is probably waiting for you to push the clutch if it needs to remove power from the source as part of that. It has much more control over the overall stability of the vehicle if it has control over its transmission.

It may also be that their particular AWD setup can handle the power at the tailshaft from an automatic but not a manual. Manuals are much more efficient than automatics typically, which means since there are less friction losses there's potentially more torque at the tailshaft. Finally it may just be some sort of requirement of their design to have the fluid coupling of an automatic rather than the solid one of a manual for some reason.

Perhaps you could write to them? Slim chances but maybe they could explain the philosophy of this design decision to you, as long as you approach with genuine curiosity and keep the gripe to a minimum.",eli5

However in a game like The Witcher 3, it's faster to warp to an entirely different area of the map than it is to load a save or continue after death.

The sunflower plant contains hormones called auxins. These hormones are sensitive to sunlight and do everything they can to seek shade! Therefore, they migrate from the part of the plant bathed in sunlight to the shaded region in the stem. Once there, the auxins (which are essentially growth hormones) stimulate the growth of cells. This causes the stem to become bulkier in the shaded region, so the flower ends up bending in the opposite direction – towards the Sun! As the Sun moves across the sky, the auxins also continue to migrate to the part of the stem that is shaded, continually making the shaded part bulkier by stimulating cell growth. That’s how the sunflower continues to face the Sun – constantly bending away from the bulkier part of the stem.",eli5

54n5jd,Why do some countries have different birth rates between men and women? Why is it that countries like China have a massive difference between men and women with men being born so much more often. Then there are some like Ukraine with fewer men? Does this have something to do with culture?,"The actual conception rate of male and female babies is pretty much identical around the world.

In some countries, it is more desirable to have a particular sex of child. China is a good example. When the Chinese government implemented the One Child Policy, adoption rates of baby Chinese girls skyrocketed. This is because in Chinese culture, a male is viewed as more important than a female. So for the parents who are only allowed to have one child, they want to ensure it is the gender they want. 

There is also selective neglect. Similar to the above, some countries feel that having a male is better for the family as a whole. Take parts of Africa, for example. When speaking of very poor African countries, they have little to no access to birth control, meaning they will inevitably birth a lot of children. However, male children tend to grow to be stronger, play a bigger and more important role in the tribe/community, etc. If the family already has low funds and nourishment to begin with, the bulk of the nourishment will go to the child that the family believes will have the highest success rate, and who will be able to support them in their old age.",eli5

It's a lot easier, when you're making a cake that has lots of customization to start with a base cake. It's the same thing with people. Men have nipples because, during pregnancy, it's easier to make a ""base"" human. So for example, during development, all babies develop the beginnings of a vagina and penis. During later development when genitalia is specialized, your assigned sexual organ develops, but your opposite genitalia doesn't disappear. (For men, this vestigial organ is the vagina masculina, and women have a clitoris.) So it's the same with nipples. The nipples are created just in case the baby was female and, later the milk producing organs are created along with a female reproductive system due to greater exposure to estrogen rather than testosterone.",eli5

2xjtco,"How do we know what causes cancer? Is it just a list of stuff that can be linked to it, or is there a way to tell if something can cause cancer? ","There are two basic angles we can come at - one is based in theory, the other in correlations.

On the one hand, we have a broad idea of what's wrong with cancer cells: namely, certain genes that are supposed to stop them from dividing out of control aren't working. So then we look at what can damage genes in that way. Things like radiation, certain chemicals, genetic disorders, or viral infections can cause problems with the genes in question, and in those cases we can trace exactly how one causes the other.

On the other hand, we can look for correlations. For example, we notice that certain types of cancer are really common in people with AIDS. This indicates that normally, those cancers must be suppressed by the immune system - so if we see that type of cancer, we can suspect that something is blocking your immune system. Or we might notice that certain groups - say, cigarette smokers - have way higher cancer rates than other groups, and suspect that whatever defines that group somehow causes cancer.

wsn7c,"Why does a penis shrink in cold water? I know this may sound funny to some and immature but I've always wondered why. 

(Update)
Our human body is composed of water for the majority, and when water freezes in expands. How come it shrinks when it's in cold water?","Penis size is regulated by blood flow into the penis.  The mechanism behind an erection, for example, is pretty much just an increase in blood flow to that part of the body.  This causes the penis to expand much like a balloon when it's filled with water.  In other words, there is a relationship between blood flow and penis size.

Heat regulates blood flow.  When the temperature is low, the body undergoes vasoconstriction, the constriction of the tubes that carry blood throughout the body.  By making these tubes smaller, less heat is exchanged between the blood and the outside environment, so the blood stays warm.  However, vasoconstriction also decreases the blood flow to the penis, which as explained in the first paragraph, affects size.",eli5

89sqc4,Why do some animals get older than others?,"In evolutionary context this is referred to as trade-offs, and there are variable characteristics, I'll use a fly and an elephant as examples.


Flies are basically ""live fast, die young"", they trade-off for the large amount of offspring they can produce by having relatively short life spans. They reach sexual maturity quickly, mate, have many many offspring and then die. Elephants take years to mature sexually, and trade-off for their long lifespan by having only one offspring (rarely two) at a time. Of course there are other characteristics to consider (size like you mentioned, large animals trade off for the size by having a small amount offspring and vice versa, the amount of time parents spend nurturing the offspring, etc). 


So basically one characteristic is traded in for another to help maintain the balance; if animals could live forever, mature quickly, and produce many offspring they would be evolutionary monsters and take over the world.",eli5

5ha1gn,"how and why is eating meat so bad for the environment? *just quickly: I know this is a tense topic at times so let's all remember to stick to the rules, keep it civil and fact-based!* 

I would like to understand how consumption of meat makes your carbon footprint so much bigger than being vegetarian or vegan... People say it a lot and I know meat comes from animal factories but I don't 100% get why it's so bad. Why is consumption of meat so bad for the environment? 
I don't personally eat meat for other reasons (saw the 'Lisa the vegetarian' episode of the Simpsons when I was ten and basically never looked back) and I know a lot of people who say it's bad for the environment and I can guess or imagine why but I don't want to go saying that unless I personally understand HOW, and how bad. 

Is eating meat once a week still contributing massively to global warming? 
Is replacing meat with tofu or vegan protein burgers an improved carbon footprint??
Surely if someone is eating grassfed beef that come from a farm wouldn't that contribute even more to greenhouse gasses because each cow needs more space and lives longer? 

Thank you in advance! 
 (I have searched through to see if someone's asked this and have found related questions but not the same so I'm still confused.)","The main problem is cows require a lot of land for grazing. It takes a lot of grass to feed a cow. Claiming land for beef farming is the leading reason for Amazon deforestation.

One counter argument that people sometimes bring up is the fact that C02 that cows emit was only recently removed from the atmosphere by the grass they consume, so it's different from C02 that is emitted by burning coal. This is true, however, when we remove trees and replace them with grass, that land holds a lot less carbon than it did previously. A forest can sequester a significant amount of carbon dioxide, while land used for cattle grazing sequesters virtually none.",eli5

585eim,"Why do we have over 18,000 unaffiliated police departments in the United States? Why isn't there a single government agency that unites them? I guess I am asking why we have no national police force.","Because there are lots of levels of legal authority in the US, and they are largely independent of each other (by Constitutional design). Federal laws are not the same as state laws, which are different from county or city ordinances. And sometimes they conflict. No single agency has the authority to enforce all those different laws, and even when the laws coincide, the heavy lifting is often left to the lowest level of authority that can effectively do it. For example, a murder investigation is generally done by the city PD where it happens, because they can do a local investigation best... the case will then be prosecuted by the locals _unless_ it's part of a bigger batch of crimes - like a multi-state crime spree - that needs interstate authority, and then the FBI or some other fed agency gets involved. 

For the most part, a state trooper or FBI agent isn't going to write you a parking ticket. And a county sheriff's deputy isn't usually going to be running a murder investigation. Now, if a cop witnesses you breaking the law, they may be able to hold until the proper authorities do arrive, but maybe not. Each of those areas may cooperate with neighboring areas, but they might just as well jealously guard their independence.

A good example is the recent dustup in the South  &  Southwest over using local cops to do immigration enforcement. The short answer, from a legal perspective, is: they can't. State, county, or local cops are not authorized to make immigration busts for the simple fact that states, counties, and cities don't make immigration law. Only the federal gov't can do that, so only the federal gov't can enforce those laws. ICE may sometimes use local cops for additional manpower on larger raids, but the busts are all ultimately under the authority of ICE (or whoever).",eli5

- Pregnancy is also not without risk. By preventing pregnancy, you are preventing pregnancy related risks.

- Many animals can become sexually frustrated which can lead to obsessive behaviours such as licking their genitals until they bleed. 

- Spaying and neutering will change the behaviour of most animals, which puts them at less risk. It makes males less aggressive so they are less likely to get into fights. It makes your pet less likely to escape and roam. It makes your pet less likely to engage in undesired dominance behaviours (such as excessive barking or mounting or spraying). Now, these last behaviours are not necessarily physically unhealthy for these animals, but sadly, it does put them at greater risk of being too much for an owner to handle and going to a shelter.",eli5

bdxm2z,"Why is an orgasm such an intense, pleasant feeling?","The brain (and consciousness) has evolved to be a sort of feedback system that has helped to improve the success of an organism/species as a whole. 

Imagine the brain as the principal of a school. The students perform there work, either poorly or well. This is analogous to an organism doing something, either helpful or not. The teachers (or certain receptor types) “appraise” the students work and report it to the principal. The principal uses this information to decide how to do its job; if a student is struggling (ie. a behavior is unhelpful/harmful to an organism) the principal will “try something new”. Perhaps the principal will talk to the student and identify the source of the issue and figure out what s(he) can change to improve the student’s performance. Similarly, the brain processes information about a harmful act and sends signals that are perceived as pain. This motivates an organism to change what it is doing and try something else. 

Something like having an orgasm would be extremely helpful in passing the genes on to the next generation so the brain has evolved (over a long period of time) to release large amounts of dopamine (the reward neurotransmitter) when an organism does it. 

For your question about if someone was “wired wrong” if they could feel the opposite; this would be incredibly unlikely to occur. The DNA that encodes an organism is very precise. In order for someone to develop with their nerves “hooked up to the wrong sources” (for lack of a better explanation) there would have to be MAJOR mutations of the DNA.

195pw7,"How come an ant can fall 20 times its body length and end up unharmed, but people can't? ","The square-cube law.

If you imagine a standard person — say six feet tall, 180 pounds — and scale that person down by a factor of two, how tall will that person be? Three feet, obviously, because he's half as big as he was.

But how much will he weigh? If you guessed 90 pounds, you'd be wrong. The answer isn't *half* of the guy's original body weight, but *one eighth* of it, or just twenty two and a half pounds.

And that's just for a factor of two. Scale that person down by a factor of 100, and you get a person who's three-quarters of an inch tall, but weighs only as much as a grain of sand.

When you sneeze and that little guy flies out of the palm of your hand and hits the floor — a drop of let's say four feet — he will hit the ground at about ten miles an hour … but since he only weighs as much as a grain of sand, the force on his body when he comes to a stop would be … meh, I'm too lazy to do the arithmetic in my head, but it'd be very small indeed.

Force is mass times acceleration, remember. When mass is small, force is small … and as *size* — linear size — goes down by a factor of two, mass (for constant density, which is a fair approximation) goes down by a factor of *eight.*

v6h5s,"why does college tuition keep gong up? With the gradual advent of online options (some free, but generally lowering delivery costs, etc), and the generally slow rate of inflation, why are college tuitions continuing to go up?

It makes some sense for public universitys hit by budget woes, bit why are elite private colleges, with massive endowments (e.g. Harvard) likewise increasing their costs?","This is often a controversial standpoint, but student loans make tuition more expensive.

You've probably read a bunch of threads about how today's college students get annoyed when they hear stories about how their parents were able to afford to completely pay for college in the 70's with a part time job at a hardware store and still have money for a case of Natty Light.

In the interest of equal opportunities for everyone, the government introduced federal student loans in the 60's.  The program has been expanding - and loan sizes increasing - ever since.  Since more people could 'afford' college, demand has raised and so has tuition.  There are almost three times as many college graduates today compared to the 70's according to the census.

It has become a game where the government lets students borrow more and the schools raising tuition accordingly.  Since the demand is increasing, the colleges can increase tuition and people will still pay because to them, they feel that college is a requirement to succeed and the government will lend to them anyway.",eli5

238n4y,"Why do we change our heating/cooling inside our homes? 65° during the summer feels great, but it is freezing in the winter. I am not talking about when we first enter the room, but rather being stuck inside the house for hours.","Radiation.  There are two types of heat transfer at work here: convection and radiation.  Convection is heat transfer via a moving fluid (literally conductive advection).  When you change the thermostat setting, you are changing the temperature of the air and therefore the heat transfer between you and the air.

However, all matter hotter than absolute zero emits energy as radiation, with hotter things emitting more radiation.  All matter is also constantly absorbing radiation that was emitted by other matter and it can be thought of as heat exchange between two samples of matter.

So what does that mean?  Well, you are constantly exchanging radiation with the walls of your house.  The outside temperature will change the temperature of your walls, even with the heat or AC running.  This is especially noticeable in concrete or cinderblock buildings; even if the room is comfortable, if you touch the wall during winter it will feel very cold.  So in the summer the walls are hotter and therefore radiating more heat than in the winter, but your body is a constant temperature and radiating a constant amount.

Put it all together, there is a certain amount of net heat transfer that is comfortable (i.e., perceived as a comfortable temperature).  That certain amount is a combination of convection with the air and radiation with the walls.  In winter, the radiation is lower, so you increase air temperature to compensate.  In summer, the radiation is higher, so you decrease air temperature to compensate.

4umlsg,Why do things appear the color they are? A question of cause and affect. What is it about objects that affects the light that reflects off of it the way it does and what affect does it have on the light that give it color? I'd also like to know how light titillates the retina.,"An object's physical and molecular structure determines how and what light reflects off, refracts through, or is absorbed by it. It is extremely complicated what *exact* physical mechanisms are involved but it involves a deep understanding of physics and chemistry.

The cells in your retina react to specific wavelengths (energy levels) of light. When they detect that wavelength, they activate and send a signal to your brain.

All red objects, for example, happen to reflect light of the ""red"" wavelength so we detect them as red.

We only have three color-detecting cells in our eyes, so we only detect the levels of red, green, and blue light. Using those three detectors, we can actually detect many in-between colors. For example, yellow light has a wavelength between that of red and green (think of the rainbow: ROYGBIV) so the red cells activate a little bit and the green cells activate a little bit. So when our cells report weak levels of both red and green, we detect that as yellow.

Interestingly, this can trick our eyes. For example, we absolutely cannot tell the difference between purely yellow light, and a mixture of both red and green light that stimulates those retinal cells in the same way.

This means that some yellow things actually reflect different light from others, since some reflect both distinct red and green light, while while others reflect purely yellow light (although I suspect most things that reflect light typically will do so in a particular band of wavelengths most strongly, not two separate bands - but light color mixing is how your monitor displays yellow to you, by shining both red and green light at you at once!)

This is also why pink (magenta, not light red) doesn't actually exist as a wavelength of light - it is just what we sense when both the red and the blue detectors trigger at the same time. No pure wavelength of light can do this since they are on opposite ends of the spectrum!",eli5
1s7nf2,"Why does America still have a Farm bill? ELI5:Why does America still have a Farm bill? I've had a quick look at it, and for a free market economy it seems to impose the complete opposite. 
If someone can provide a more details explanation of what it is and why it continues to be that'd be great.","Well, the United States *doesn't* have a completely free economy. It's more free than many other countries, but there are still a lot of protectionist industries, with the notable ones being Steel and various Agriculture products (especially Sugar).

That said, there are three basic reasons for the Farm bill.

1) Protection for farmers if a drought or storm kills the crop or cattle. This would wipe out the farmer/rancher, and prevent him from using his skilled expertise (Industrial farming can be considered skilled labor) in subsequent years to grow food as he is bankrupt/can't get a loan. That's not to say the government swoops in and completely pulls the farmer back on his feet, but the government does offer a stretched out hand. 

2) Provides subsidies for a farmer so he can afford to leave some land fallow (unplanted) for a period of time. This preserves and builds up nutrients in the soil, which is necessary even in this age of chemical fertilizers. Otherwise, the farmer has an incentive to maximize his profit by planting all his fields all his time, which would wear out the soil even with soil saving techniques such as crop rotatoins. 

3) The government essentially subsidizes many articles of food for the farmer to make it profitable for him (fertilizer/GMO crops can be expensive, etc) to grow it without selling it a high price to the consumer. Lower prices for consumers = more money spent on other products and services in the economy, especially by the lower economic classes. 

There are also downsides. For example, Refined Sugar in the US is more expensive than in other parts of the world because we're very protectionist of our sugar industry. This causes higher sugar prices than if we allowed free trade.",eli5

2sl8ob,"Why do tractor trailer trucks need 18 large wheels, but very large planes only need 6 small ones? ","Trucks drive a lot of miles and weigh a whole lot, so their weight needs to be distributed.  Otherwise they're causing a lot of wear on the pavement.  Virtually all wear and tear on highways is caused by trucks, so spreading out the load is very important. Planes only ""drive"" a short distance on pavement, so there's less infrastructure being damaged by having the load more concentrated.  

Additionally, putting more tires on a truck is fairly cheap (you have a nice rigid frame to bolt the axles to) and can make the truck safer (losing one tire out of 18 is relatively minor; losing one out of 6 is a bigger deal).  By comparison, putting more tires on a plane means that you increase the weight by quite a bit.  Losing a tire on landing is pretty inconvenient, but there aren't other planes out there that you're going to hit if you get a flat, so the safety issue is less present.

Then you look at the life of tires on trucks versus planes.  A truck is looking to drive thousands of miles before they have to replace their tires, so you want to have lots of tires to reduce the wear and spread the load.  A plane would ideally like to do a couple hundred landings on a set of tires, which is likely under 1000 miles all told; some planes may only do 10 landings on a set of tires (looking at you, SR-71).  It's OK to have to replace tires all the time on a plane since carrying around more tires would cost even more.

Finally, note that while planes are larger than trucks they aren't *that* much heavier.  A truck may be 100,000 pounds, all told, while a 737 (6-wheeled aircraft) maxes out at about 150,000.  Meanwhile, *very* large planes like the 747 have far more wheels—18 for that model.  The C-5 Galaxy has 28 wheels.  The An-225 has a whopping 32 wheels.",eli5

bqx98d,Why doesn’t the water in lakes and rivers get absorbed into the ground? ,"Some do lose water due to seepage. They lose more or less depending on what kind of rock and sediment lies beneath the lake. A rocky bottom holds water better than a sandy bottom.

Lakes are also subject to evaporation from their surfaces – especially in a dry places – for example, the American West.

So why don’t lakes just dry up? Some do. For a lake to keep its water over time, it has to be replenished. There are both natural and man-made lakes. The main way that water gets into reservoirs and man-made lakes is from the rivers and streams that were dammed to create them. Like man-made reservoirs and lakes, natural lakes may also be replenished by rivers and streams.

Natural lakes have another advantage, when it come to holding their water. They tend to form in the lowest elevations in a given area. So these sorts of lakes may also get underground water that flows in from underneath the lake – the lake floor may be an area of water input, rather than a drain for the lake.",eli5

6m5w23,"Why is it that when you pour liquids out of a smaller opening (like from a jug of milk), then the liquid sputters out instead of flowing evenly and consistently? ","The flowing liquid obstructs the outlet and prevents air from flowing in.  A suction quickly builds up on the inside, preventing further fluid leaving.  For really small openings the flow remains stopped and the container can't empty.  With larger openings air bubbles find a way inside and flow can continue for a short while until there's a need for another air bubble.  This results in the familiar glug-glug-glug cycle as the outward flow of liquid alternates with the inward flow of air.

How big a hole is big enough for the flow to be stopped?  It depends on the viscosity of the liquid.  Pouring less aggressively so that the liquid flow doesn't fully block the outlet can be faster.

Another trick is to swirl the liquid a little as it flows out.  The centrifugal force causes the liquid to flow out around the rim of the outlet, leaving a hole in the middle for air to flow inwards.  The continuous flow of air in and liquid out is faster than with stop-start glugging flows.  Over-doing the swirl slows down the flow, especially at the end so I find it helps to at least slow the rate of swirl once the container is nearly empty.",eli5

If you donated a million dollars to Ethiopia and it was perfectly distributed among the population, every person would get about a penny.
We actually give many billions of dollars to third world countries, but there are still so many people that it can only have limited impact. For example, last year the US government gave around $600,000,000 to Ethiopia, which amounts to about $6 a person. $6 isn't going to make a poor person not be poor anymore. It's only $6.

Many people will bring up the corruption and bureaucracy that prevents aid from reaching the people, and that may be a valid reason not to donate more aid. But regardless of the reasons, third world countries are not donated so much money that they should not be poor anymore.",eli5

Apple likes his work and wants to use the symbols and pays the designer to be allowed to copy them.

9asr9l,Why are there no mass-shootings in Switzerland,"They do not have lax gun laws. A large amount of the population owns guns, and shooting is a common recreational activity, but they have very strict laws about purchasing, owning, and using firearms. 

To purchase a firearm in Switzerland, you need to be over 18, a citizen or permanent resident, have a clean criminal record, and provide the government with a valid ID, current address, and copy of your criminal history no older than 3 months. 

You need to go through that same process to buy ammunition, and also include proof that you legally own the weapon you are buying ammunition for. You cannot buy ammunition for guns you do not own or don't have a license to own. 

You cannot openly carry your weapon outdoors or in public, even if it's unloaded. Exceptions are made to hunters with a valid hunting and weapon permit, historical reenactments, or shooting competitions. Open carry permits can be obtained, but are normally issued to security and other jobs that would require you to carry a firearm. Such permits require you to have a plausible need to carry the firearm, and pass an exam covering weapon handling and knowledge of gun laws. 

Switzerland doesn't have mass shootings because they have these protections in place. The United States lists ""the right to bear arms"" as a right protected by the Constitution, meaning that similar license and database systems would be unlawful in the US.",eli5

bqqjhw,why do computers use RGB rather than RYB to make all the colors? ,"Because red, yellow, and blue aren't the primary colours of light.

Our eyes detect basically three wavelengths of light: red, green (slightly more on the yellow side of green, but still green), and blue.  All the light that we can see is caused by the three types of cells responding to those three colours of light.  If the light is bright yellow, then both the red and the green detecting cells will react, since it's close enough to their detection that they activate but don't activate as strongly as if it was red light or green light.

Red (actually, magenta), yellow, and blue (actually cyan) are the primary *pigment* colours, because each absorbs a single colour of those three, so that mixing them produces a new colour. For example, magenta light absorbs green light but reflects red and blue light.  Meanwhile, yellow absorbs blue light and reflects red and green light.  If you mix yellow pigment and magenta pigment together, you end up with something that absorbs both blue and green light, which means it only reflects red light, so it appears red.",eli5

I hear them in news stories about homelessness and drug abuse. What exactly happens when you join the military?

Your hands, when wet, are incredibly humid (100%), whereas the air around them is decidedly less so (5-30% depending on where you are). When you sweat and it evaporates it is because of two things; the first is that you are heating the sweat on your skin, and the second is that your skin is more humid than the air around it. This creates ideal conditions for heat to enter the sweat, then to leave your skin in the evaporated sweat. The same idea applies here. Heat is entering the water on your hands, and then being removed by the drier. So even though the air is warm the heat in your hands is being pulled out of them giving the sensation of being cold.",eli5

When fingerprints and DNA are long gone, a person's teeth can identify them.

Bacteria don't rot teeth, at least, not directly. Bacteria living in your mouth consume basic carbohydrates (like sugars) from your diet. When they consume these carbohydrates, they produce acids which decay your teeth. When a person dies, the gravy train of carbohydrates stops and the bacteria colonies die.

6zkhdj,"Why do most STDs spread via sexual intercourse and not through other actions like making out? EDIT: Okay, I should clarify. I understand what STD stands for, I'm asking what exactly causes them to spread. Is the disease in the sexual fluids? If so, then do they spread if it's swallowed? Do they spread because the fluids get into the blood stream through genitalia acting as a semipermeable membrane and soaking up the fluids? Do they spread because they're being transferred directly into genitalia? Is it harder for males to get STDs because the fluids have to go through the urethra or is the urethra just as susceptible to intaking diseased fluids as a vagina? It would seem to me like the urethra is less susceptible because it's not a direct entry point into the body, even urinating afterward I feel like would cleanse it and dramatically reduce the chance of diseased fluids getting all the way ""upstream"" per se. 

I'm curious, what it is about STDs that causes them to spread via sex and not other means (like making out). Is it mostly because of fluids that are excreted during orgasm? I feel like it would be harder for men to contract STDs as well since the fluids have a bit of a distance to go up the urethra if that's how it works. Can you contract STDs if no fluid excretion was involved, and again, how? Would it be from the skin absorbing the fluids?","There's different answers for STDs, so I'll take you through each one. The major STDs are: Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Syphilis, Herpes, HPV (genital warts) and HIV. 

1. Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by the microbe Neisseria Gonorrhoeae. This microbe has a predilection for infecting epithelial cells (such as those found in the urethra). It is actually able to both attach to the cell lining as well as to invade cells and live inside them. It is spread through sexual secretions (semen, vaginal secretions) when cells slough off into the secretions. It is completely possible to get gonorrhea in your throat, and is actually more common than you might think. It causes an infection that presents somewhat similar to strep throat. 

2. Chlamydia: Chlamydia is also a bacterial infection caused by the microbe Chlamydia Trachomatis. Just like Gonorrhea, it is able to invade cells, but chlamydia can only live inside cells (similar to a virus). It is spread the exact same way as gonorrhea, and can also infect the throat. However, Chlamydia tends to present with a cough as well as conjunctivitis (eye inflammation). 

3. Syphilis is another bacterial infection caused by the microbe Treponema Pallidum. It has a complex pathogenesis and life cycle and initial infection results in a chancre (a large painless ulcer, beware when googling images of this). It then enters the blood and lymphatics and disseminates throughout the body where it lies dormant for a while. Syphilis is spread by blood and bodily secretions (not saliva, due to unclear reasons, likely due to the presence of antibacterial substances). Syphilis can also be transmitted by oral sex, however it doesn't typically affect the throat. It tends to form a chancer on the lips or on the inside of the cheek. 

4. Herpes is a virus that is spread by direct contact. It can appear almost anywhere on the body, but is most common on the lips and genitals. 

5. HPV (human papilloma virus) is a virus that, like Herpes, is spread by direct contact. Only 6-10 strains (out of hundreds) actually cause symptoms-some strains cause warts, others are linked to cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against the strains most associated with warts and cancer. 

6. HIV is a virus that is spread in blood and bodily fluids (again, not saliva). It is only infectious if it is able to enter through and open wound and get into the blood. Anal sex inherently creates numerous microtears in the rectum, and thus increases the risk of HIV transmission (this is why homosexual practices are associated with higher levels of HIV transmission and thus why HIV was once considered a disease of gay men). It is theoretically possible to get HIV from oral sex, however I am not aware of any actual confirmed cases of this. HIV is destroyed by stomach acid, so it would have to infect its host prior to entering the stomach. 

There are other STDs, but these are the most well known ones.",eli5

I feel if the do the work and make the grade they should have the say chance as those who are coming out of high school.,"Many schools use scholarships as a recruiting tool.  From a business perspective, it doesn't make sense to spend your 'advertising' money on a student who will only attend 2 years when you can hook a student that will end up paying you for 4 years.  This is compounded by the fact that many low-level classes are really cheap to teach because you can have one grad student teach a room full of 100 undergrads, compared to an upper division course that requires a tenured faculty member teaching 10-15 students.

Beyond that, they don't *need* to offer incentives to CC students.  Many CC students that are attending college are adults that have a job and/or family that they need to stay close to (or want to keep living with their parents to continue saving money).  These students are going to attend the college close to home regardless of any incentive a scholarship provides.

Finally, most of the recruiting effort is targeted at the 'traditional', just out of HS students because *they're the majority of students*.  It takes time and money to put together recruiting materials, it makes the most sense to put together a program that targets 90% of students rather than 5%.",eli5

Do we instinctively make this noise? Is it just the noise I learned to make?

1ye7xl,Why cant endangered/vulnerable animal species like koalas be domesticated to preserve their numbers? ,"Domestication would take generations of breeding, which causes several problems. First, quite a few would have to be taken out of their habitat to find those with traits most suitable for domestic life, which is a problem considering their already small numbers. Second, even if their numbers did grow, domesticated koalas (or other animals) would never be able to live in the wild due to them being naturally reliant on human habitats, so their numbers in the wild would never be helped. That is the main reason we wish to save endangered animals that have been effected by humans, so the habitat doesn't become dangerously unbalanced due to their absence. Also, keep in mind the difference between domesticated animals, like dogs and cats, and tamed animals, like pet monkeys.

The better solution is to use currently captive koalas to breed, and then bring their offspring up in an environment that is close to how they naturally live. However, this has historically been a tough endeavor because we often know relatively little about how and when the offspring of endangered species naturally learn the skills they need to survive in the wild.",eli5

In real time, all this happened in 3 seconds while it seems like 5 minutes. What causes this time suppression?  Is there an instant where time can seem sped up?","Time appearing to slow down is actually an illusion. The part of our brains that helps us feel emotions, the amygdala, becomes more active during times of stress. This causes our brains to ramp up memory recording, making our memories in the moment of a car accident or similar situation much more dense and detailed. 

Compared to our normal memories, it seems like memories that detailed must have been made over a longer period of time than the quick few seconds of the crash would allow. This makes us feel that time slowed down. But it's just memories temporarily being set into ""4k recording"" mode, so to speak.",eli5

As such, precautions are taken so that if the worst case scenario happens and something goes wrong during take-off/landing, we minimise the damage. Being upright and locked into place, means the seats are better at absorbing shocks and people can brace for impact. Trays and loose items are stowed so they can't turn into projectiles. Having your seats upright also means that if they do need to evacuate, everybody has enough room to get out of their seat. Evacuations have to happen quick and efficiently, and that can't be done if someone else's reclined seat means you have trouble getting up from yours.",eli5

76749u,Why did the US colonies form separately instead of just one big colony? Most other countries like China or Russia formed as a big single entity so why did the US form multiple colonies which led to multiple states?,"In places like China or Russia, you had one power trying to subjugate the others and establish a form of central authority. The strongest kingdoms conquered their neighbors and established a unified state. (In China, it fell apart several times and was then re-unified.) The history of the colonies in America is different.

In North America, different groups came to the country for different reasons. One difference was national--the governments of Britain, France, Spain and the Netherlands wanted their *own* colonies that would benefit themselves. But especially among British settlers, each colony was also driven by different ideas. Some went to North America to develop prosperous plantations. Some went there to establish a new kind of society. Some wanted to escape war and persecution in Europe. The British crown granted each colony the right to have a limited kind of self-rule. Over time some colonies got merged, and the British conquered a lot of the foreign colonies.

Before the American Revolution, the colonies were still separate, even though they were all British. They built increasingly close relations with each other, for example they organized a joint defense during the French and Indian War. They saw they had a common interest. When they became upset with Britain, they decided to fight for independence together--different states, but all Americans, organized through the Continental Congress. Even after the Revolution it would take many years for people to see themselves as truly united. They developed a constitution that gave some power to a central government, but left most of the power with the states. The Civil War showed that the states were willing to use force to keep the other members a part of the Union. Especially in the 20th century, federal power increased a lot. But even today, people disagree about how much power should lie with the federal government versus the states individually.",eli5

6pe2f5,"Why is it better to get uninterrupted sleep than the same number of hours of fragmented sleep? And why do some people require more sleep than others? I'm tired, Reddit.","Not all sleep is the same. You go thru stages over the hours, from light sleep (alpha) to REM. 

During periods of relaxation, while still awake, our brain waves become slower, increase in amplitude and become more synchronous. These types of waves are called alpha waves.

The first stage of sleep is characterized by theta waves. The difference between relaxation and stage 1 sleep is gradual and subtle. As the sleeper moves to stage 2 sleep theta wave activity continues. 

Stages 1 and 2 are relatively ""light"" stages of sleep. In fact, if someone is awoken during one of these stages, he or she will often report no being asleep at all. That's why fragmented sleep is not good, you don't go beyond stage 2. 

As you continue to shut down your brain patterns change to delta wave patterns. Delta sleep is our deepest sleep, the point when our brain waves are least like waking. 

After that you sometimes get to REM (rapid eye movement). It's theorized that REM helps the brain clean up memories accumulated during the waking periods (dreams). For that reason hormones are released so the skeletal muscles of a person during REM sleep are effectively paralyzed so you don't act out your dreams. 

REM sleep a sleepers brain waves demonstrate characteristics that are similar to waking sleep, a combination of alpha, beta, and desynchronous waves. 

In a normal night's sleep, a sleeper begins in stage 1, moves down through the stages, to stage 4, then back up through the stages, with the exception that stage 1 is replaced by REM, then the sleeper goes back down through the stages again. **One cycle, from stage 1 to REM takes approximately 90 minutes**. This cycle is repeated throughout the night, with the length of REM periods increasing, and the length of delta sleep decreasing, until during the last few cycles there is no delta sleep at all.

So you sleep for less than 90 min you don't complete a full cycle and without a few cycles you don't feel rested because your brain cleanup is not done.

This morning, for example, I naturally woke up at 7:30 even thought I had my alarm set for 8:30 so I thought it would make sense to go back to sleep for another hour until my alarm actually went off. As the title suggests I woke up after another hours sleep feeling more tired. Why is this? 

I know this is a pretty ridiculous question but it has been bothering me for quite some time!

EDIT - spelling","You're interrupting a sleep cycle. When you wake up before your alarm, you're doing so because that's when your cycle has moved you from Stage 1 NREM to REM, and then to waking up. If you choose to go back to sleep, you reset the cycle, and will typically fall back into Stage 1 and maybe even hit Stage 2. You can easily be woken out of Stage 1, but because it's the middle of a sleep cycle, and not the natural awakening, you feel unrested.

To put it simpler, you wake up early because your body wants to. You can make it fall asleep again, but if your alarm interrupts you before you finish your next cycle, your body feels that interruption in the form of grogginess.",eli5

Follow up questions: would a closer relationship promote a higher chance of genetic mutation, or a more severe mutation (i.e. brother and sister vs. second cousins)?
I'm curious if early humans had some different build, but because of having to reproduce and fill the earth, we had incest upon incest, making what we see as normal now a genetic mutation then. 
And if that ^ is not the case, why the heck not. ","Incest doesn't cause any more mutations than normal - it just makes it more likely that mutation that already exist will become dominant.

Everybody's DNA is made up of matching pairs - One from your mother and one from your father. Normally if there is a ""faulty"" gene on one side it is counteracted by the healthy gene on the other side. This is because healthy genes are usually stronger (dominant) and unhealthy genes are weaker (recessive)

But with incest the amount of genes the two people have in common is greatly increased which means that if there is a ""faulty"" gene somewhere is their DNA then there is a much greater chance of two faulty genes matching up.

Unless I am wrong, cells aren't able to function properly without it's cell membrane.

If this is true, why can't we create a protein that is able to disrupt the cell membrane of incurable diseases? 

- sincerely, a confused high schooler. :)

Edit 2: Could this method apply to antibiotic resistant bacteria instead? Would it be possible to disrupt their cell membranes by possibly using, advanced engineered polymers, such as (antimicrobial polymers)? ","Ebola is a virus, not a cell, so there's no cell membrane to disrupt.  Any type of medicine that works by disrupting the cell membrane would have no effect on viruses.  

Bacteria are another matter.  Antibacterial methods work through 4 basic mechanisms, three of which involve the inhibition or regulation of enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, nucleic acid metabolism and repair, or protein synthesis.  The fourth mechanism of antibacterial action works on the disruption of membrane structure.

So we've already created antibiotics that work by disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria, but because viruses don't have cell membranes (and aren't cells to begin with), those compounds have no effect on viruses.

9e786k,Why does inbreeding cause birth defects? Why does mixing similar DNA lead to these issues?,"Inbreeding doesn't exactly cause birth defects - it just makes them more likely to appear. Traits are determined by the genes associated with them, and each gene can have several types, or alleles. Depending on the gene's importance or the effect of the allele itself, an allele can be harmful to the individual that bears it. Oftentimes this allele is recessive, so it's ""masked"" by another (every person has 2 copies of most genes) that is healthy. However, this recessive allele can still be passed on to children. So when you have a population that constantly breeds within itself, you increase the probability of offspring inheriting two copies of the harmful allele.",eli5

a62ti2,Why aren't you allowed cellphones and other wave emitting equipment in a mine?,"Cell phones do not work underground due to all the rock shielding the radio signals. So there is no reason to bring it with you. However in a mine there are lots of dangers that can potentially be triggered by cell phones. They often use radio signals to set off explosives. This was in fact one of the first used of radio. However the triggers they use are very simple as they are designed to be disposable and to not have interference. So it is possible that a phone can set off these explosives just like it can interfere with a speaker if you put them too close. And secondly a mine often have explosive atmospheres. They often have lots of explosive dust and can come upon pockets of methane or other explosive gasses. So anything that can make a spark is prohibited. Even a small cell phone will generate thousands of volts in its antenna. So if there is some sort of damage, for example water or soda having corroded away some of the material close to the antenna, then the phone might create a spark which can detonate the atmosphere.",eli5
5f6zk6,Why can't you divide a number by 0? Mathematics,"Algebraic reason for this is that, division is just multiplication. If you're dividing by 2, you're actually multiplying by half.

If you're dividing by 4, you're actually multiplying by a quarter, or 1/4.

If you're dividing by 0, you're actually multiplying by 1/0.

So if you have 0 x 1/0, that should equal 1, because 0 from both sides simplify away. But

    0 * 1/0 = 1           | 0 = 0+0
    (0 + 0) * 1/0 = 1     | distributivity, (a + b) * x = ax + bx
    0 * 1/0 + 0 * 1/0 = 1 | using the identity on the first row
    1 + 1 = 1
    2 = 1

None of the rules we used above sorta allow us to make any exceptions to them. Basic arithmetic just doesn't allow for 0 to be divisor without things breaking down.

How in analysis you may study this is, instead of trying to divide by 0, you divide by small number **close** to 0, but not 0. So if you divide 1 by 0.001, you get 1,000. If you divide 1 by 0.00001, you get 10,000.

Which is why some think 1/0 should be infinity. Unfortunately, -0.0001 is close to 0 as well, and 1/-0.0001 = -10,000. You get negative infinity if you approach 0 from negative side. So it's not like it being infinity or negative infinity works either. 

And from just common sense standpoint, there really isn't that much you can do to make sense of ""divide 1 to 0 people, how much does each person get?"". Obviously you can answer anything you want, and it makes equal amounts of sense since there are no people you're dividing it with.",eli5

5d6880,Why does putting your card into a plastic bag make it work in a card reader. ,"The strip on the back of your credit card is actually a small magnetic field.  When you swipe it in a card machine, it reads these small magnetic fields and registers them as either a zero or a one, otherwise known as binary code.  Binary code is a set of these ones and zeros that can represent a number, letter, or even an instruction for the computer to carry out.  The back of your card will have several of these sets of binary code that ultimately represent your cards unique number.  

When your card gets scratched or otherwise dirty, it can create anomalies when the reader attempts to register the numbers.  When this happens, the card is not processed and you'd have to try again.  Card readers are sensitive so any little thing that could cause the magnetic field to be read incorrectly might cause it to fail.  When you use a bag or scotch tape, it creates a buffer that allows the magnetic strip to still be translated by the reader, but also can mitigate possible anomalies caused by the scratches or dirt because they're not directly rubbing up against the reading head anymore.

There are times when the card itself will be beyond saving, especially if the strip is scratched deeply or just worn out.  Luckily, most if not all card companies will replace your card free of charge.  Card readers themselves can also be finicky, especially if it's older or is dirty and not cleaned.  Try not to keep your card next to anything magnetic and also away from your cell phone as these can demagnetize the strip, depending on the kind of magnetic strip being used.",eli5
1ln2xc,"Why is there concern over the impact of pesticides on bee populations, but very little discussion on the safety of humans eating honey with pesticides? [Pesticide Residues Found in Honey](_URL_0_)","It has to do with the concept of HAZARD vs RISK.

HAZARD is when a chemical can cause harm, whereas RISK is how likely the chemical will cause harm.  Risk also takes into account the concentration of a chemical in a body.

The reason the pesticide argument focuses on the bee population is that bees are much, much smaller than humans.  If 1 microgram (10^-6 gram) of pesticide gets ingested by a bee weighting 0.1 g, that's 0.01% of it's total weight.  For a human weighing 100 kg (easy math, 10^5 g), that's 0.000000001% of their weight.  As you can see, the small amount of pesticides found in the honey will affect the bee much more than the human, purely based on concentration.

That being said, bees and humans will be affected differently by different chemicals.  For example, a pesticide may target a specific protein only found in insects, but have no effect in humans since we do not have the same protein in us.",eli5

","If you have a residential Internet connection, you're not paying X amount for a meticulously controlled speed. You're paying X amount for Internet up to a certain speed.

There are companies that will give you Internet access with a Service Level Agreement (minimum speed guaranteed or your money back) but they're very expensive because they have to have dedicated space on the lines just for you.",eli5

When Ford was paying workers $2 per day (maybe $2.50, not sure), the going rate at the time, there was lots of turnover and constant hiring and training, so Ford decided to double the rate to $5 per day to reduce turnover and keep employees instead of constantly training new hires.  At the same time, he also decided to make a five day work week to give his employees Saturday off, thinking they would buy more cars to ride around in for the weekend.  The local business community told him he would bankrupt his business.  The day after he ran a full page ad in the paper for the $5 per day jobs, there were massive lines of people applying for jobs with Ford.

1ot9ak,Why can't fish that live in salt water survive in freshwater? ,"Osmosis is a process in cell membranes under which water goes from areas of low solute concentration to high solute concentration.

Organisms generally can't live with lots of salt inside them, so saltwater fish have low levels of salt inside themselves, but are surrounded by water that has high concentrations of salt. So they are constantly losing water through osmosis. As a result, they are built to constantly ""drink in"" more water (and have their kidneys filter out the salt).

Freshwater fish generally have a higher level of salt inside their bodies than in the surrounding water. They are constantly taking in water through osmosis. They are therefore built to constantly ""pee"" out excess water.

Since most saltwater fish are built to deal with osmosis in a way that is *opposite* from the adaptation they need, they cannot survive in fresh water. They do not have the same adaptions to rapidly get rid of water from their bodies, since they are used to water naturally leaving their bodies through osmosis.",eli5

6kbg28,How come we can't always tell which nationality a singer is by just their singing voice? ,"Every singer has influences. There were artists that they admired and wanted to be like, and that influenced their style and performance. And those influences? They had influences too.

So, why can't you call the nationality by the singing voice? Because most English speaking pop stars had influences that were American -- or their influences had American influences, and so on. This goes back to the 1950s, when rock and roll emerged in the southern United States and spread very quickly as a popular music style.

You can see this in a lot of British artists; many say that they ""sound American"" because they affect a rhotic accent when the sing, even though they may have a non-rhotic accent in their speech. You see this all the way back to the British Invasion of the mid 60s -- groups like the Beatles and The Rolling Stones were emulating their influences, which were people like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis and the other pioneers of rock and roll.

That said, not everybody did that. Herman's Hermits, for example, have their accent quite noticeable in their performances. But still these influences have trickled down from artist to artist over the last 60 years.",eli5

5qpezo,How did the challenger shuttle explode? Due to today being its anniversary I attempted to find out how it exploded but I have only found sources stating a complex way of how it exploded.,"It was an O-Ring failure.  But what's an O-Ring anyway?

O-Ring joints are rubber and are designed to handle tremendous pressure and to also be flexible (to accommodate any imperfections in the mounting parts).  Because they are rubber, if the surface is too rough, they can suffer from abrasion and wear out.  Also, because they are rubber, temperature can affect them as well (too cold, they lose flexibility).

So what happened to Challenger when the O-rings failed?   The rockets were made of several tubes joined together.  The best description I've heard is that it's like stacking tin cans and filling them with gasoline. The force and pressure of liftoff can pull the cans apart slightly where you tried to join them, so you line them with a flexible rubber seal, like in canning when you have a rubber seal on a jar.  If the seal doesn't hold, you loose air pressure in the cans and burning fuel can escape -- you lose propulsion and get a big explosion.

Rubber o-rings lined those joints in the space shuttle and kept burning fuel from leaking out. That morning, the temperature was too low, the rubber was not flexible enough, and there wasn't a good seal.  Burning fuel, leaking out...an explosion.

But alcohol messes with those protein receptors. It makes it so they are more sensitive, and will alert your brain to heat at a lower temperature then they normally would. This temperature threshold becomes slightly lower then your body temperature.

3rn5rq,"Why don't cable providers offer 'pay per channel' packages for like $0.80 a channel? I watch about 5 or 6 channels and I will certainly not be paying for cable when I get a house of my own... So why don't they offer something that we actually want?  Also, isn't the point of having advertisements playing during something (ie. pandora) because that service is free?  If cable costs money and plays adverts aren't they doubling their profit at the expense of us the consumer?","Because by bundling things together they can charge you more for stuff that you don't necessarily want, and that makes them more money. It also allows them to offer more niche programming, because the smaller, lesser-known channels that normally wouldn't have enough people  willing to pay specifically  for that channel are bundled in with the more popular channels that people actually want to pay for. If they let people pick and choose which channels they wanted, people would choose fewer channels overall, and they would have to charge less and make less money overall. Plus they might not have the funds to support less popular channels anymore, or wouldn't be willing to take as much risk providing channels and programs that might not be popular, because the cost would no longer be absorbed by grouping it with profits made from the more popular channels. Basically they know that you dont want all of the channels they offer, and they don't care, because you'll pay for the whole package anyway because you don't have a choice.

Now that being said, things might change because of the advent of services like Netflix and Hulu, which are contributors to driving down the numbers of people who even pay for cable programming at all anymore. They might have to adjust their sales model to compete and convince people that cable really is worth buying even with most shows easily available for free online or through cheaper services. But Netflix and Hulu operate similarly; you pay an overall cost for all of the programming, even though they know that you only want to watch a fraction of it. For a service like that it's easy to see how creating a custom Netflix selection that you choose yourself a-la-carte with different prices for everything would be difficult and impractical. It's easiest to provide a large selection that covers the majority of people's interests and assume that everybody is going to be able to find at least something they like.",eli5

31eb0c,"Why does one get tired after prolonged exposure to sunlight? Today was a beautiful sunny day, so I went walking on the beach. When I got home I immediately passed out for 2-3 hours (it was still daytime).  I was not tired at all before the walk, and know that it is somewhat of a thing that being in the sun for a while has knack for tiring people out.  Why is this?","adapting to sunlight and heat is metabolically taxing.  Sunlight in particular causes hormone shifts, particularly an upsurge in melanin and melatonin as well as constriction and flooding the body with vit. D.  These directly cause a feeling of tiredness.

Being in the sun causes damage to cells as well, and responding to that damage causes exhaustion (the same is seen following many injuries, and, unsurprisingly, burn victims, where the volume of damaged cells is high.)  I am not clear if the exhaustion is caused by the sudden increase in WBC and hormonal instructions and energy load of cell repair, OR/AND if it is an adaptive response to maximize the effectiveness of those systems.

Finally, the act of staying cool AND active is taxing on the body.  If you are not trying to be active, and it is very hot, your body will decrease function and you could nap/lay still through the heat, but if you are actively trying to work, your body uses active processes (mainly sweating, but also increased heart rate and blood vessel dilation, which require those muscles to be active) Doing this causes a metabic load not only on the krebs cycle, but also on mechanism and the need to balance macro and micro nutrients.  As this adaptation continues, the body continues to weaken because the ability to feed cells (which is, ultimately, based on ratios of exchangeable materials) starts to decrease (the ratios are thrown off.)  In a healthy, well fed person, this can be restored with brief rest.  But, the acute drain can be higher than even a healthy person can adapt to if taken to an extreme (a marathon for instance is very extreme for most people, and not doable at a constant run)  Early signs of failure are dizziness, cramping, and other signs of mental and muscular instability, but this can quickly degenerate into loss of consciousness or seizures, obviously water/electrolyte imbalance is the most common cause, but it isn't the only way.  This is commonly called ""heat stroke.""

Basically, hot, rather than cold, is the most challenging environment for our body's internal processes to adapt to.  Cold requires large caloric intake and artificial methods to retain heat, both of these preserve resources.  But heat requires the body to dump resources, or enter deep states of rest.  note that resting is the adaptive response of people and other warm blooded animals across most desert regions, it just isn't worth the metabolic cost to be active during the hottest part of the day.",eli5

4ijes4,How are lakes created by nature (not man made lakes) and how did fish get in them? ,"Land is not level. It's full of crinkles and mashed together piles, and flat areas too. That creates very low areas (ocean), low areas (lakes) and high areas (land), with rain refilling the second type with fresh water. Rainwater runs downhill and has a tendency to accumulate in any sort of depression, so a lake is often ""fed"" from a very big area where uphill rain or snow has fallen, and that's called a watershed.

Those lakes quite often aren't physically closed off, they usually have either permanent outlets that flow to other lakes in the form of streams or rivers, or they can create temporary passageways when flooding conditions occur such as if a beaver builds a dam. Fish then swim up these access points, and some like eels that migrate through wet woods are really good at it. And if the lake they find is healthy and that stream closes off, once they're there, they're there for good.

Nor are those lakes permanently stuck in one place in many cases. Some of them have had fish for millions of years back before fault lines caused a lake to split in two, or stopped an access stream or cut off access to salt water because it was redirected by a landslide or a growing peat bog or beaver dam.

Even remote lakes with no apparent historical access to other bodies of water at all can have fish in them though. They can possibly get there by being transported accidentally by other creatures (e.g. fish eggs stuck to a waterbird's feathers, or in water-weed nesting material that a flying bird drops).",eli5

If you dope a semiconductor to where it is very close to becoming conducting than you can apply a control voltage when you want current to flow through it and remove the voltage when you don't want any current.  This is a transistor which functions kind of like light switches.  Flip the switch and you get light/current; turn them off and you don't.

You can then put them together, build them up into logic gates, and then scale that up into the multi billion transistor count system on a chip that power modern computers.",eli5

But your question is not actually a myth at on time there was a reason for saying it. Old TV's emitted a lot of X-Rays and overexposure to X-rays can be dangerous. In fact the screens were made of lead glass to   the rays from escaping. TV manufacturers warned children to not sit close to TV's for more than an hour due to the X-rays shooting through the vents on the bottom of the set.

5vbe7i,"Why is rain measured in mm/inches, and not, say mL?","Milliliters are a measure of volume. The volume of rain you capture in a container depends on the area that the container covers, because more area = more water collected = more volume. So a measure of volume wouldn't tell you anything about the actual intensity of the rain because it would vary depending on your container.

When we measure rain with units of distance, we're measuring the height of the water that accumulates in a container over a particular period of time. This height will be the same regardless of the area the container covers, because for any increase in area, you increase both the container's volume and the amount of rain it captures by the same factor. Meaning they cancel out and you're left with a universal measure of rainfall irrespective of your container.

For instance, let's suppose you have a container that covers one square meter of land and captures one liter of rain per hour. If you double its size to cover two square meters, it now captures two liters of rain per hour, since rainfall is distributed roughly equally across land area at small scales. But since this collected water is spread across twice as much area, it still accumulates to the same height within the container.",eli5

2d57pa,"Why is that people see ""Method A"" of killing as terrorism but ""Method B"" of killing not as terrorism but as freedom fighting or defense? Why is it always the more powerful force that is the non- terrorist and the less powerful force that is shown to be a terrorist?
","The difference between ""terrorism"" and ""freedom fighting"" can be kind of arbitrary, and basically boils down to how the speaker feels about the insurgents. ""Defense"" is a completely unrelated term, which applies when you are protecting yourself from a threat. A terrorist or rebel can act offensively *or* defensively, and it'll depend on the situation.

Finally, your question about why the ""more powerful force"" aren't considered terrorists isn't completely accurate. As we're seeing in the Middle East right now, it's entirely possible that ISIS is more powerful than the Iraqi government. The reason that the stronger force is rarely considered to be insurgent is because of definition. An aspect of terrorism which is common in *most* definitions is that it *can't* be carried out by a legitimate government. A government which bombed their own citizens (assuming they did so openly and took credit for the attacks) would be considered a brutal regime guilty of crimes against humanity, mass murder, and so on, but semantically it's not terrorism.",eli5

Since there are huge loads acting on the steering mechanism due to the weight of the vehicle, having a larger sized steering wheel means feedback force through the steering column to the driver is reduced and is able to be controlled.",eli5

5dw1u2,"Why is there congestion even when there isn't a traffic accident? Specifically for highways where there aren't any red lights or stops, why do large amounts of traffic cause congestion? If there's no accident and no reason to stop shouldn't traffic just flow consistently and not get backed up? ","There's been some research into this lately on closed roads and loops. Researchers have put together a model.

Imagine a line of cars all travelling down the road together. The front car has to slow down for whatever reason. A second later, the driver behind them reacts and slows down. Because they reacted later, they had to slow down just a little bit more than the car in front of them to regain their original space. The car behind that has the same problem, slowing down even more.

Once traffic is dense enough, whenever you slow your car down by a small amount for any reason, like creating an opening for a car merging in, that slow down travels backwards along traffic in a wave, becoming more and more intense. If that wave hits an empty patch of road, then it's dissipated, with the distance between that car and the one behind it permanently reduced. If it doesn't, then it eventually becomes a full stop, resulting in stop-go traffic.

Researchers have been trying to identify driving techniques to counteract this, but there just aren't any. Leaving a large space in front of your car only helps at first, because if you have to slow down to increase that space back to it's 'resting' point then you've just made a new wave. It's safer than tailgating, but not better for traffic.

The best solution is simply to add more road. More lanes for the same number of people means lower density, which means more spaces for cars to buffer out waves by losing distance to the car in front of them.",eli5

bb3tag,Why does bad vision get better when you squint? ,"Imagine that instead of an eye you just had a flat retina exposed to the world on your face. Light from any direction would be able to fall on a given patch of your retina so it wouldn't be very useful; you couldn't tell that there is a red ball in a specific direction because light from it would be all mixed in with light bouncing off everything else.

A lens solves this problem by focusing the incoming light. In essence what it does is sort it so that only light coming in from a certain angle will exit the lens at that angle as well. Now with the retina behind the lens only the light coming from the ball will hit a given part of the retina and light from other directions won't hit that part. A useful image can be formed.

But there is another way to sort that incoming light. Suppose we put the retina into a box with only one tiny hole through which light could enter. Light tends to travel in a straight line so for any given part of the retina there is only one path to the outside world, straight through the hole. This tiny hole is sorting light much like the lens does, the smaller the hole the better the sorting effect. The cost of course is reduced intensity of the light let through because only that which passes through the hole reaches the retina, while the lens focuses over the area of the lens.

Squinting is narrowing the aperture of your eye and in so doing increasing the focusing effect.",eli5

Having three would not add anywhere near as much benefit -you might be able to focus a bit better but that's unlikely to be a survival trait. You might get a wider field of vision - which would be good but it's easier to use your ears and turn your head when you need to look at something elsewhere. Eyes are also vulnerable to attack and would make another weak spot. They also take a lot of resources and brainpower so you'd need to find more food. All in all: 1 good, two better, three pointless.

I read that V=IR so if dry human skin has a resistance of 100,000 Ohms then there should be enough current to kill you right? ","Because electricity takes the path of least resistance to get to ground and that doesn't usually involve passing into the body. Also, even if it goes through the body, it still completes a loop through air (do you actually touch the Van der Graff generator, or simply approach your finger)?


Typically Van de Graffs only generate a few micro Amps. Way below a fatal current which is usually given as 10 to 50 milli amps.

 V=ir and the numbers you are trying to plug in only apply to a steady state. The van de graf just doesn't store enough energy: it gets dissipated long before affecting your heart.

No power supply exists which can produce an unlimited current every supply is current limited in some way. A Van de Graff, or a door knob for that matter, can only produce a ""few"" electrons for current flow. It may be at a very high potential but the current flow is limited by the electrons available. I quoted few because of the huge numbers involved in these processes.


Also:



	
The resistance from one hand to the other is about 1,000 Ohms. 750,000 Ohms is the resistance of your skin. But when the voltage is high enough, the skin looses it's resistance and you are left with the 1,000 Ohms of internal resistance. A Van de Graaff generator can not produce much current. Let's say it's current is 10 µA. V = I*R. 10µA * 1,000 Ohms = 10 mV. That's the voltage that drops over your body. 100,000 V is what you get when the generator is insulated from ground. When the generator is grounded, whether it's through your body or through a wire, the voltage drops to nearly nothing. Btw. a Van de Graaff generator is a constant current source. It's output current is always the same independent of what resistance is attached to it.",eli5

44stbb,Why are prime numbers important in cryptography when we know all the primes up to a fairly large number publicly? What little I know it's because the make good seed values since they are so  unique so it helps against brute force attacks.  But since large primes are out there on the net I don't understand how the are useful.,"Great question.

There are at least three separate issues here:

**Knowing big primes doesn't mean knowing all of the primes**

There's a huge difference between knowing very large prime numbers, and knowing *all* of the prime numbers up to that point.

The prime numbers used in cryptography are typically something like 2048 binary bits long. In decimal that'd be a number over 600 digits long.

The number of primes up to 600 digits long is more than the number of atoms in the universe. So it's not like we can just look up primes.

People who search for very large prime numbers use special mathematical tricks to try to find a few very large primes. They deliberately skip over all of the primes along the way.

**It's actually not hard to determine if a number is prime**

Not hard for a computer, at least! Determining if a 2048-bit number is prime takes a modern computer much less than a second. Determining it with absolute certainty is a bit slower but not that slow, but cryptographic algorithms actually use a *randomized primality test* that takes a shortcut. It correctly answers if a number is prime or not very, very quickly, but it's occasionally wrong once in a million years. That's good enough for practical cryptography.

**Cryptography depends on factoring, not on testing primeness**

First of all, there are lots of different cryptography algorithms, some have nothing to do with primes.

However, those that do, like RSA, depend on the idea that factoring a large number is very hard. Essentially if you know that a 4096-bit number is the product of two 2048-bit prime numbers, there's no ""shortcut"" to figure out what those two factors are. You basically need to try dividing it by every possible number to see what its factors are.

So that's a weird thing about primality testing - it's actually easier to determine if a number is prime or not than it is to determine *what* its factors are. A computer can *very* quickly say that a number is almost certainly not prime, but it can't tell you *why*.

So that's the basic idea behind the algorithm. You come up with two prime numbers at random (literally by trying lots of random numbers until you find two that are prime), then share the *product* of those two numbers while keeping the factors secret.",eli5

 When your upper airway (throat, mainly) gets irritated, the body's response is to cough, which may forcefully clear the irritant from the body. More broadly, the cough reflex can be activated by any abnormal sensation, including that of capsaicin.

2sp44p,"what makes Intel and ARM processors different? Why is one better than the other at different tasks, i.e. battery life v. performance? so there are rumours that Apple is planning to switch from Intel processors to ARM _URL_0_

The advantages are that ARM processors are meant to give better battery life, vs Intel which performs better. Why does one perform better at battery life vs the other, or in terms of power, heat, etc? What happens when you recompile software from one platform to another? I know they aren't directly translatable, but there are, for example, builds of Ubuntu for both x86 and ARM platforms - how does essentially the same software work on the 2 different platforms?","First of all, all processors fall under something called an ""architecture"". This architecture defines what kinds of instructions are used by computer programs to instruct the CPU to perform tasks. Architecture also defines what kinds of memory and memory sizes are available to the CPU and how many electronic pulses that represents 1s and 0s (bits) the CPU processes per cycle by way of the ""bit size"" (e.g. a 64 bit processor processes 64 electronic pulses per cycle). To define a ""cycle"" by example: a processor at 2.4 Ghz will have 2.4 billion (Giga) cycles per second (hertz). A quad core processor processes 4 simultaneous different streams of bits in this same manner. This is why one can't say ""a quad core 3 Ghz is 12 Ghz"".

x86, the architecture behind most Intel and AMD processors is extremely bloated and has a lot of stuff from decades of development and hasn't really had any old stuff like old instructions trimmed away. This has ultimately made x86 extremely inefficient and requiring a larger list of instructions to perform the same task. The cause of this is in part operating systems like Windows whereas changing the architecture would require the operating systems to be changed as well. It's like rebuilding a building foundation after the building has been built. Not going to happen.

ARM on the other hand, is simpler in design and has a more efficient instruction set due to the fact it's historically heavily used in low-power devices like routers, printers and other similar specialized devices. Devices that really don't have many resources available. It's just recently ARM has made its way into front-line computing due to the press toward things being power and performance efficient for mobility.

Now, whenever you run a compiler, you are essentially telling the computer to ""Make a list of instructions from this programming code"", so if you take that code and compile it on a varying array of different architectures you're creating different instructions each time that each CPU architecture will understand.",eli5

But there're a lot of factors at play here: 

1) Age. The older you are, the less elastic your skin is. That's essentially what wrinkles are. 

2) Amount of weight loss. If you're going from 1000 pounds to 200 pounds, that's a lot of weight loss and a lot of skin. If you're going from 220 pounds to 200 pounds, that's a lot less skin to retract.

3) Excess skin requires time to shrink back. During extreme weight loss, a person may lose fat faster than their skin can shrink.

There are also limits and genetics at play. Sometimes stretched skin will shrink, but not completely back to its ""normal"" form.",eli5
6wa4ad,"Why is Some Pain Experiences as a Throbbing Sensation, While Other Times it is a Constant Feeling? ","Pain is reported in different ways depending on what is going on to cause it.

In medicine pain is broadly split into two categories somatic and visceral.

Somatic pain is the sharp constant pain you would feel if I started poking your arm with a sharp knife. Visceral pain is the throbbing, aching, pain of a stomach ache.

The somatic pain is caused by direct stimulation of a pain reporting cell called a nocioreceptor. It is direct and specific, so the brain interprets the signal directly and specifically.

Inside the body though, most organs themselves don't have those pain receptors. (They wake people up during brain surgery for example to ensure they aren't doing neurological damage and people don't feel that sharp somatic pain in their head while they are in there, because there aren't receptors there for it.) Instead, organs are generally wrapped in a membrane that has pain receptors in it. When something in your body gets injured or is infected it swells and stretches this membrane. This stimulates all the receptors in that membrane and sends a more general signal to the brain which is then interpreted as a general throbbing pain. The throbbing is literally a result of your heart beat, as your blood pressure pulses up and down with each heart beat  blood swells the injured organ further a tiny bit. When the blood pressure drops in between heartbeats there is a little less pressure in the in injured organ and the swelling is relieved a tiny bit. Nocioreceptors are very sensitive, so they feel the tiny pulsation in the organ and report it in a ""throbbing"".   

You can experience the range if you stretch a muscle. At first there is a minor aching pain throughout, but as you force a joint too far the pain becomes more sharp and intense. Eventually it would feel like someone was stabbing you as the pain localized to the area where a muscle started to tear.

There are a lot more complicated subtleties to this as well that have to do with the development of nerve pathways and brain tissue in a fetus. Ultimately the answer to some more specifics about things like referred pain (you have a heart attack and your arm hurts) you find that there is a lot about pain we don't know. There are plenty of theories, but when it comes down to it we can't explain why something like your left arm hurting during a heart attack happens.",eli5

Now imagine you lose your arm. All those memories of everything that you do with your arm, all the sensations and experiences you normally don't even think about, are still there. They're all right there in your brain, even after your arm is gone. You reach out to pick up a glass of water and the pathways for reaching and grabbing activate, even if there's nothing for them to connect to. If you don't think about it, or even sometimes if you do, the motor and sensory pathways that you're expecting to use will fire, and your brain fills in the blanks of what it's expecting to experience.",eli5

Diesel is more efficient at overcoming the inertia inherent in heavier and larger vehicles, but their greater mass means that it takes longer to accelerate them.

Diesel engines do power cars, but they take time to get up to speed, so need additional help from superchargers or turbos to help build momentum. They are generally of larger capacity than their petrol equivalents, and are therefore generally heavier, with more components to fail or maintain. 

It's horses for courses. Of course, electricity is quicker still at accelerating an object, which is why electric cars are so quick off the mark.

390z83,"If it takes ~1000 gallons of water to produce a pound of beef, why is beef so cheap? The NYT has this interesting page, which claims a pound of beef requires 786 gallons of water to produce. A Stanford water conservation site claims 1800 gallons.  

_URL_0_

_URL_1_

My cheapest tier of water costs $3.49/'unit', which is $4.66 for 1000 gallons of water. This suggests that _just the water cost_ of a pound of beef should be close to $5. I buy [ground] beef at Costco $3 per pound. What gives?

edit: 
 I have synthesized what I thought were some of the best points made (thanks all!)

* This number represents primarily untreated water e.g. rainwater and water pumped directly from aquifers by farmers.

* In the US, there are indirect subsidies to the price of beef, as components of their feed are subsidized (e.g. corn). 

* Farmers are free to raise their cattle in places where water is cheap

* Obviously $3 ground beef is the least profitable beef obtained from a cow – they are getting what they can for that cut. 

* It seems clear that, in the context of the linked articles, these figures are misleading; the authors are likely not expecting the reader to call to mind a slurry of rainwater, runoff and treated water. In the case of the NYT article, the leading line is that the average American ""consumes"" this water. Obviously there is very little to no opportunity cost to farmers benefitting from rainwater, and it is not fair to say that by eating beef your are ""consuming"" the cited amount of water.

7qhbo8,Why in America does the person who wins the most votes in an Election not win the Election?,"The US is a Federated Republic (Think more like the UN or EU than a single country like France). It is the member entities of that Republic (The States) that vote for who their leader is. The votes of the citizens of a given State dictate how that State vote with a winner take all for their pool of votes (for most States). Each State gets 3 votes plus additional votes based on population to make their pool of votes in their pool. This means that most of the time the person who wins the popular vote also wins the States votes, but it is possible to win a lot of the middle and low population States and lost the high population States and win the Presidency without winning the national popular vote. 

For Congressional elections they are winner take all and the most votes win in most States, though a few have proportional voting which try to mach the percentage seats to the percentage of the popular vote a candidate/party gets.",eli5
7lyyol,why are some acids such as hydrofluoric acid and HCl so good at dissolving solids on contact? What causes this? I have basic Chem 1 knowledge behind me but I still don’t see how a solution can simply eat through something on contact. What is happening here?,"Most of the time, the behavior of acids depends on two things: the strength of the acid and what the anion of the acid is (as an example, the anion in HCl is Cl^- because dissolving HCl will give H3O^+ ions and Cl^- ion).

Hydrofluoric acid is an odd one. Unlike all of the other halogenic acids (HCl, HBr, HI), HF is a weak acid; this is because the fluoride anion has a very high affinity for electrons and will hold on to any it can get a hold of. So this means that HF eats through materials because of the fluoride anion. Fluorine is the most reactive element, so as an ion, it will always find ways to be more stable; this means that it is willing to eat through glass (to form fluorine-silicon bonds), plastic (to form fluorine-carbon bonds) and even human bone (to form fluorine-calcium bonds; a small amount of HF on your skin can give you a heart attack because of this). 

As for HCl, things are a little bit different. Chlorine, while electronegative (having an affinity for electrons), is not as insane as fluorine; unlike fluorine, chloride anions are able to remain stable in an acidic solution and have no desire to bond with literally anything around like them, unlike its crazy brother fluorine. This means that HCl is reactive because it is a strong acid; this means that all of the H-Cl bonds break apart in water, so you have a glass of hydronium (H3O^+ , which makes an acid acidic), water, and chloride anions. Because billions of chloride anions are available to react, they can readily attack anything which will allow the chloride to obtain a lower energy level; a common example is magnesium. All of the chloride anions will readily react with magnesium, and because there is so much chlorine, the acid will eat through the metal like it's nothing.

I hope this answered your question. Please let me know otherwise.",eli5

1yzp9p,"How come ""Black Power"" is seen as r Inspiring, and pro-equality/freedom etc. however ""White Power"" is seen as racist? We were studying African American Civil-Rights in history, this thought poped into my head.","Black people have been oppressed, and have been told to be ashamed of who they are, and that they were inferior, equivalent to animals or property.  Supporting Black pride or black power is about saying that there is no need to be ashamed or feel like you are inferior even though society would lead you to believe you are.

White people (as a general vague group) haven't been broadly oppressed in the same way, they have not been near universally considered inferior subspecies who are better used as property then treated as human beings.  On the other hand they've been the groups that have supported and put in place these ideas towards others.

So ""White Power"" is treated as ""supporting oppressing non-whites"" because people who said ""white power"" in the past **actually did that a lot**.  Saying ""Black Power"" is treated as ""overcoming oppression"" because that oppression actually existed/exists.  If Black people had broadly treated any non-blacks as subhumans and used the law to make them property, then ""Black Power"" would be seen as supporting that.",eli5

90rik4,"Why do the fifth, seventh, and twelfth frets on a guitar create a pinch harmonic but none of the others do? ","Those are the natural harmonics. 

When the string vibrates the wave is a superposition (things added together) of wavelengths that are twice the string length, 1x the length, 2x, 3x, etc, with amplitudes decaying exponentially (meaning the lowest is the strongest, etc). 

If you picture these waves along the string, the antinodes of those shorter wavelengths (a null, where the string isn't actually moving) are at frets located at 1/2 the string length (12th fret), 1/3rd (7th or 19th), 1/4 (5th or 17th), etc along the string. When you gently press your finger there it mutes out the waves below the harmonic, allowing only those above it to sing. It's essentially frequency dependent muting. 

There are actually multiple locations for those harmonics along the string, because there are multiple antinodes for each harmonic. When you fret a note, those locations shift upward. Pinched harmonics are done by doing the exact same thing as a natural harmonic, except with antinodes closest to your picking hand, and keeping track of how those positions shift towards the bridge as you fret notes. 

It sounds complicated but it's not that difficult with practice.",eli5

Clearly the airstrikes are not being as effective as desired and, if the ""local"" armies like the Kurds were not fighting on the field, ISIS would probably be controlling even a bigger part of the region, and slaughtering many more people.

So, why isn't this happening? Wouldn't it be better to stop ISIS before they grow in numbers, in terrorist attacks, in controlled regions, and so on?","The West is reluctant to start another war since they are still dealing with the longest war in US history (Iraq and Afghanistan). The only way to 'stop ISIS' would be another war that is very similar to the two we just 'ended', and it would also be just as long and costly.

The US realizes that they can't just go in and eradicate a group that is controlling a large area because after all the money and lives are spent, another group will take over and fill that position, and they will be the same type of group. They will be against the US because they just spent a decade being bombed and occupied by US forces, and it will just be the same situation again, so the US is basically trying to let the middle east deal with it's own problems without intervening too much to stop that cycle.

They problem is that any 'threat' to the US is not taken lightly these days, so if the group seem capable of seriously harming American interests another war will be started.",eli5

For a 30ft wide billboard, you only need around 8MP to achieve 9DPI.

Transmission fluid must maintain a higher viscosity than either of those and constant strain and pressure

Engine oil must maintain its lubricating properties from -50f to 300f and not break down.  And not foam up in the process of being churned up by the engine.

Windshield washer fluid must not freeze but can’t leave an oily residue on the glass

7npj99,"In video games, cars have a max speed. In real life if a car exceeds this max speed, what happens or could happen, if anything, to the car’s engine, chassis, etc.? ","Depends on the car. Most real life street cars, the max speed is either an electronic limit (basically the gas pedal stops working once you hit it) or it's the actual limit that the engines horse power ceases to accelerate the car, this is more common in higher end cars. The max speed is thus the speed that air resistance (and other losses) matches engine horse power.

Now what happens if you exceed that? Say you strapped a rocket to your sports car? The most common thing, if in gear, the engine may redline, and likely the failure mode is valve float (the valve springs are not strong enough to close the valves, and they may hit the piston), some engines the connecting rods might break from the forces. Those are the common RPM limit failure modes, and would result in a rapid unplanned disassembly of the engine. There are a bunch of other common failure modes (like lack of oil to the pistons, resulting in it seizing, and head gasket blowing resulting from too much fuel/air in the cylinder, but those are more common if the engine is supped up to provide more power than the engine block was designed for).

Now if you pop the car into neutral and let the rockets power you, typically the first component to fail will be the tires, exceed their speed rating and they'll blow apart. At very high speeds, and if you have special super high speed tires, the next failure is aerodynamic, a bad bump or something and the front lifts up and you start flying. This depends a lot on the aerodynamics of the car.",eli5

Food can fall on them. Bodily fluids. etc, etc get on your nice cotton shirts. If you wear the same shirt for 3 days straight it will start to smell and get gross.

A pair of jeans on the other hand, if you measure bacteria and dirt when you start wearing them, and then measure a month later very little has changed. Sweat itself is effectively odorless to humans, the smell from BO comes from the bacteria eating proteins in your sweat.

You have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction.

You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. 

Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. 

tl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell. Sweat glands in your legs just produce water with salt which doesn't attract bacteria and thus does not smell.",eli5

What you seem to be describing is a situation where CDN hosting didn't happen and everyone tried to pull the data from a single region.

Basically if 4000 people got together and bought up 70% of the shares in discovery communications could those 4000 people effect change in the networks programming?,"Depends on the company. With most companies, yes. The shareholders vote for the board of directors and the company executives have to answer to that board so you could install people that would push for your preferred change. Some companies have tried to rig things so that this isn't possible- Google, for example, is set up so that each share held by co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page is worth 10 votes, so even if you had 70% of the shares, they'd still have more than 50% of the votes.

3ccz8i,"Swearing. Where did it start, why is it socially unacceptable, and who labeled certain words ""bad"", and why are substitutes usually okay? ","This is an interesting linguistic issue, and I'm currently writing something for publication that in part handles this particular question. As for where it started and why it's unacceptable, that's an unanswerable question, because it exists pretty much everywhere. It started when human society started. 

Every language, every culture, has a list of words that ""shouldn't be spoken"", and they follow a certain pattern: they generally fall into three categories. Body parts/bodily functions: fuck, shit, ass, cunt, etc. Derogatory slurs: nigger, chink. And important religious words: damn, hell, etc. These categories are likely to get labeled ""bad"" because body-words are seen as undignified for fairly obvious reasons, slurs are offensive and are used to hurt people, and religious terms are powerful and devout people believe that they should not be used lightly. 

Substitutions are okay because, even though these words are labelled ""taboo"" they still have meaning and they still have a purpose beyond their undesirable connotation. You still need a word to describe feces, so we use ""feces"", ""crap"" ""poop"", and so on. It's only natural that these synonyms get substituted in for the taboo words when the speaker doesn't want to say something offensive.",eli5

658awh,Why do two images that have the same pixel dimensions have different storage sizes? ,"Most images are held in a compressed format that works by finding repeatable patterns in the arrangement of pixels.

So, the more patterns the compression algorithm can fine, the more compressed the image can be and the smaller the file will be. 

To take opposing examples. A 100 x 100 pixel image of a red square can be easily saved as ""put red into every square"" while a 100 x 100 pixel image of randomly generated colors without any patterns must have the color of every pixel saved in order to be properly reproduced, which takes up far more space than the simple red square.",eli5

5z9emo,"Why do we feel our hearts on the left side of the chest even though it is in the center? I've just had valve replacement surgery couple weeks back. prior to which I would have a lot of heart palpitations, which seemed to be coming from my left, as well as aches in my left arm and the left of my neck. I wouldn't feel any pain or discomfort anywhere on the right side of my chest, arm or neck. The heart is in between your lungs so why do we feel it in the left?","The heart is just left of your body's midline (the center line of the body). The reason you feel it on the left side so predominately (in addition to it's physical placement) is the left ventricle.

All 4 chambers of your heart contract (beat) (first the top two simultaneously; the left and right atria. Then the bottom two chambers simultaneously; the left and right ventricles). The Right Atrium takes in all the de-oxygenated (used) blood from the body and when the upper chambers beat, it sends blood to the right ventricle. Blood is then sent from the Right Ventricle to the lungs in order to off load CO2 and take on fresh O2. Blood then goes from the lungs to the Left Atrium. When the upper chambers beat, blood goes from the Left Atrium to the Left Ventricle, the largest of all four of the chambers. This chamber is the thickest, hardest beating part of the heart (which pumps all oxygenated blood back out to the body) and is located on the left-most side of the heart, which is already slightly left of your body's midline. Which is why you feel your heart beat on the left side of your body rather than dead center.",eli5

4lzl7l,"People say that proving P=NP would change computing overnight, but how? Wouldn't you still have to figure out the programming/computing technology to solve the NP problems? How would it affect our current computing? ","First you have to understand a little bit about the P and NP problem classes. For instance computer scientists already know a fast algorithm to multiply two numbers together, which happens to be a P problem.

However computer scientists don't know a fast algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, which happens to be an NP problem. The Traveling Salesman Problem is defined as so: Given a list of cities what is the shortest possible route that a traveling salesman can visit each city exactly once and return to the origin city? Alternatively computer scientists also don't know a fast algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem, which also happens to be an NP problem. The knapsack problem is defined as so: Given a set of different objects, each with a weight and a monetary value, determine the number of each item to put into the knapsack so that the total monetary value is as large as possible. 

What computer scientists learned is that some problems can actually be converted into other problems by using clever logic. For instance the Traveling Salesman Problem can actually be converted to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, where the details to this problem are not really important here (just know that it is also an NP problem and does not have a fast algorithm to solve it as well). Computer Scientists also found out that the Knapsack problem can be converted to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, along with many other problems (Decryption is another one of these problems, which also happens to be an NP problem). These problems, that can converted to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem, are actually called NP-Complete problems. 

Now IF a computer scientist figures out a fast algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem it would mean that we could convert that algorithm to solve the Boolean Satisfiability Problem as well. In turn we could use the fast algorithm to then solve the Knapsack problem and all the other NP-Complete problems. 

The important part of all this discussion is that, if in fact P does equal NP, that means there MUST exist a fast algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and therefore a fast algorithm to solve all the NP-Complete problems (which there are a fair amount of). This would be a major discovery because then programmers would be able to use fast algorithms to solve problems that they previously thought could only be solved with slower algorithms. Which means that programmers would be able to make much faster software than they previously thought was possible just by modifying the algorithm alone and not relying on hardware advances.",eli5

Heat flows at a faster rate when the difference in temperature is greater.  So if the air is 10 degrees colder than you, you will cool down faster than if it is only 5 degrees colder than you.

Why can type O donate universally but can't receive any other blood or else the body will go into shock?","You're forgetting what's called the ""Rh factor"", usually denoted by ""+"" or ""-"". A, B, and + denote little ""flags"", if you will, on the outside of red blood cells.  O denotes the absence of an A or B ""flag"" and ""-"" denotes the absence of a + ""flag"".  Your body will attack cells with any ""flags"" that it finds that are unfamiliar to it. So a person with AB+ blood can accept any type blood because their body doesn't attack A, B, or + ""flags"" and O and - have no ""flags"".  But AB+ people can't donate to anyone except AB+, because otherwise the person will lack at least one ""flag"" and their body will attack the donated blood. And that's why a person with O- blood can donate blood to anyone, but can only receive from other O-: O- doesn't have any ""flags"", so no one's body will attack those cells, but O- people will attack any and all ""flags"".

4ialcy,"Why does language policy/planning almost always end up being about education? Especially in Latin America, where there are hundreds of indigenous languages and so policy and planning is important, why does this almost always end up meaning education? Why not media or something else? ","When you're promoting a minority language, the absolute best-case scenario is to create a generation of native speakers -- as in, children who are raised speaking the language. For that, you need to get people reasonably proficient in the language, and dedicated enough to raise their children in it, before they become parents. Schools are where most children spend the vast chunk of their day, so they're a fantastic way of reaching a younger audience. This makes them one of the most efficient language policy initiatives.

Also, many minority languages suffer from a lack of prestige. They're perceived as something that's used around the house, or when speaking to grandparents, but not quite fit for serious matters out in the real world. Using the language in education (which prepares students for the real world) can counteract this bias. 

Lastly, minority languages are spoken by minorities, who are often poorer than the majority population. In many parts of the world, language policy is targetting groups who do have schools, but who don't use TV or computers on a regular basis. 

In more developed parts of the world, or ones where language decline is less serious, you often *do* see language policy initiatives based around non-educational aspects. Canadian language policy in an excellent example -- in Quebec, French has already been shored up in the schools, and language policy now focuses on the workplace, broadcasting, and signage. In Ontario, French-speakers are pushing for a Francophone university. If Latin American language policies succeed in slowing/stopping language decline, you'll start to see the focus turn away from education and towards broadcasting, the workplace, and the government.",eli5

When you are exposed to 20C air, the heat from your body slowly radiates away into the surrounding air, leaving a small layer of warmer air near your skin. Wind blows this away (one reason that you feel cooler when the wind blows. The other reason has to do with evaporative cooling, but that's not relevant here.)

When you are exposed to 20C water, heat is very rapidly absorbed and dissipated through the water, so there's no layer protecting you. Your skin rapidly cools as it gives away its heat, making you feel, well... cold.",eli5

The color of that light depends on how cold it is.

You, warm blooded human, glow in the far infrared, which is light that is too low in energy for our eyes to see. As things get hotter, the light they give off is higher in energy. When you get to the temperature of a stove, some of that light becomes visible, a deep cherry red.

The flames are actually partially burnt stuff. They contain tiny particles of carbon, which, when they cool, become soot. In the flame, they are heated to a high temperature. They are hot enough to glow in yellow and orange light.

Going further, the hot flame of a gas stove glows in the higher energy, blue colors. As things get even hotter, like the hot plasma of an arc welder, much of the light is no longer visible - it has become damaging, very high energy ultra-violet light.",eli5

I've seen people on the Internet and even some studies that say animals are only motivated by survival, but at the same time, they have no idea that death is a thing or that they'll be dead one day. If you have no idea that you'll ever die, why would survival be such a big motivator? ","Because they are genetically programmed to. It's evolution. Individuals that do not try to survive are not able to live long enough to reproduce - or in some species' cases, to care for their young either (imagine a mother dying and leaving her babies helpless).

Trying to survive doesn't mean you need any special awareness of what death means though. All you need is to be programmed to run at the sight of a particular predator. Your computer is programmed to run millions of things, even your programs literally try to survive without crashing, but it doesn't mean your computer needs to be self-aware to perform those tasks. Self-awareness is not required for a survival instinct.

At its most basic level, it's programming that says ""Bad thing detected. Flee from or kill bad thing.""

It's wrong to even say they have motivation (for most animals), it's simply just what they do. It's like asking why your car tries to survive. It's a false question. Motivation isn't a factor.

For your more intelligent animals, survival is a motivator because survival means avoiding pain and suffering. They aren't really thinking ""I want to survive"" so much as they are thinking ""I want to avoid horrible pain"".",eli5

It only lasts a couple seconds but is rather intense, not painful but uncomfortable. The sensation resembles the one you get when eating sour candies.","As soon as you think of food or begin the process of eating something, the body goes into 'digestive mode' and begins the secretion of saliva, gastric juices and other digestive juices. 

There are 3 major pairs of salivary glands in the mouth. The parotid, submandibular and the sublingual glands. Saliva contains digestive enzymes and also helps in making the food into a ball to facilitate easy swallowing. 

Thus when you keep some food in your mouth, the salivary glands get 'activated' and start secreting saliva. This sudden neural and somatic activation (of the parotid) and the secretion of saliva causes that weird pressure behind the jaw, more so when sour food is taken.",eli5

I know that one reason is to avoid inflation, but that can't be the only explanation.

Already [Submitted](_URL_0_) this in Askreddit but haven't come across a convincing explanation yet.

If governments just print money, people will think the currency is valueless (inflation) and will have no confidence in the functioning of the economy.","Actually it pretty much is simply to avoid inflation. Assuming you know how inflation works, look at what happened in Germany after WWI. They owed a lot of countries a lot of money, and instead of paying back that debt over many years, which most countries do, they decided to just print money in order pay back the other countries. Although they were able to pay of the other countries, neither side was better off: the Germans now had a currency that couldn't buy anything, and the other countries, who were counting on the money they got from Germany, were left with the same worthless money.

Insulin makes sure your blood sugar doesn't get too high by having your liver soak it up out of your blood  &  glucagon has the opposite effect.

There are 2 main types of Diabetes: Type 1  &  Type 2 (sometimes called adult onset diabetes). Type 1 is caused by your pancreas being unable to produce insulin  &  is treated using an insulin pump or insulin injections.

","Vimeo is aimed at photographers, artists etc so people uploading content to it are usually more experienced and upload better quality videos in the first place.

Youtube takes whatever video you upload and re-encodes it using several resolutions each with their own quality settings chosen not necessarily for best quality possible but rather to make the videos easy to play on a huge number of portable devices and computers (if an encoding setting would give more quality but would make the video not play on a particular TV, they may disable that option).

Liveleak has lower quality but in general, the videos that are uploaded there are probably lower quality in the first place (thinking videos recorded on phones in war zones, stuff like that). Liveleak probably also re-compresses the video to make their size as small as possible in order to save money on bandwidth and servers, they probably don't have as much funding as Vimeo or Youtube have to have their videos on thousands of servers around the world.",eli5

The lenses bend light different amounts based on the angle that the light hits the glass. Lenses are specifically designed so that, at a certain distance, any light from a particular point will end up in the same place, even if it contacts different parts of the front of the lense.

This means that even though your iron-sight is between your eye and an object, the light that reflects off that object and passes left, right, and above the irons to hit the front of the lense will get bent by the lenses in the scope back into the proper place for your eye.

Explaining would be easier if I had an illustration, but that's the gist of it.

14y3vy,"Why is it important to stay hydrated with 5+ cups of water a day? I drink at the most two cups of water a day, and those are usually when I have a meal. I just don't feel thirsty otherwise and have no desire to force myself to keep drinking.

What are the benefits to drinking the necessary intake of water, and what are the ill side effects of not doing so?","First of all, it should be clarified that it's really cups of fluid rather than water. They just say water since it's easier to remember and doesn't encourage people to drink anything specific. Secondly, the suggestion isn't that you drink them all at once.

Even mild dehydration (which wouldn't make you feel thirsty, necessarily) can cause you to feel more fatigued than you would normally. Two cups might be enough to keep you from getting dehydrated but it isn't enough to make you urinate enough. Peeing is how your body removes a lot of it's pollutants and if you don't drink enough water, your body won't have enough excess water to urinate.

Lastly, just because you don't feel thirsty, it doesn't mean you aren't low on water. The feelings of hunger and thirst are as much habits as they are your body telling you it needs something. If you eat every day at noon, you'll feel hungry at about noon since that's when your body expects to get food. The same can be true with getting thirsty.",eli5

**Sometimes people that used to be able to connect to the internet with a laptop or wireless device now can't. And they tried everything on their end such as restarting their device, troubleshooting, etc. The only option is now to reset the router. (Completely turn it off and back on). Why does this happen?**","A router is a mini computer, with a small CPU and small amount of memory, something like 16Mb.

They often run a customized version of linux.  As with any computer, the operating system can get ""confused"" or lock up, can run out of memory, or just run out of resources.  

A reboot, just like restarting Windows, clears out the memory and it starts fresh.
