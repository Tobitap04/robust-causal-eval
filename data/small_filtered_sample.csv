bqqjhw,why do computers use RGB rather than RYB to make all the colors? ,"Because red, yellow, and blue aren't the primary colours of light.

Our eyes detect basically three wavelengths of light: red, green (slightly more on the yellow side of green, but still green), and blue.  All the light that we can see is caused by the three types of cells responding to those three colours of light.  If the light is bright yellow, then both the red and the green detecting cells will react, since it's close enough to their detection that they activate but don't activate as strongly as if it was red light or green light.

Red (actually, magenta), yellow, and blue (actually cyan) are the primary *pigment* colours, because each absorbs a single colour of those three, so that mixing them produces a new colour. For example, magenta light absorbs green light but reflects red and blue light.  Meanwhile, yellow absorbs blue light and reflects red and green light.  If you mix yellow pigment and magenta pigment together, you end up with something that absorbs both blue and green light, which means it only reflects red light, so it appears red.",eli5

2njlxl,Why does hot air (from a hand-dryer) feel cold on wet hands? ,"This has to do with a principle called evapotranspiration. Essentially evaporation. Your hands, when wet, are incredibly humid (100%), whereas the air around them is decidedly less so (5-30% depending on where you are). When you sweat and it evaporates it is because of two things; the first is that you are heating the sweat on your skin, and the second is that your skin is more humid than the air around it. This creates ideal conditions for heat to enter the sweat, then to leave your skin in the evaporated sweat. The same idea applies here. Heat is entering the water on your hands, and then being removed by the drier. So even though the air is warm the heat in your hands is being pulled out of them giving the sensation of being cold.",eli5

1ye7xl,Why cant endangered/vulnerable animal species like koalas be domesticated to preserve their numbers? ,"Domestication would take generations of breeding, which causes several problems. First, quite a few would have to be taken out of their habitat to find those with traits most suitable for domestic life, which is a problem considering their already small numbers. Second, even if their numbers did grow, domesticated koalas (or other animals) would never be able to live in the wild due to them being naturally reliant on human habitats, so their numbers in the wild would never be helped. That is the main reason we wish to save endangered animals that have been effected by humans, so the habitat doesn't become dangerously unbalanced due to their absence. Also, keep in mind the difference between domesticated animals, like dogs and cats, and tamed animals, like pet monkeys.

The better solution is to use currently captive koalas to breed, and then bring their offspring up in an environment that is close to how they naturally live. However, this has historically been a tough endeavor because we often know relatively little about how and when the offspring of endangered species naturally learn the skills they need to survive in the wild.",eli5
