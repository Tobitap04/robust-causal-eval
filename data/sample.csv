551jzs,Why do people claim home ownership is a terrible investment?,"Bear in mind that you have to pay property taxes on that home.

However, it has been *generally* true that owning a home was better than renting.  But this assumption rested on several conditions being true:

1. The home acted as an involuntary form of savings that the owner wouldn't otherwise engage in.  Owning the home costs more than renting, but the extra money is effectively banked.  If you're not financially disciplined enough to properly bank this difference in cost while renting, you'll end up ahead with the home.

2. The home met your housing needs, not exceeded them.  The housing market is based off an Ozzie  &  Harriet view of American life, where the core of the market is houses built for a family of four.  If you deviate from this standard, you'll find it difficult to sell your home.  But if you don't need a home that large, you'll be throwing away money on residential space you don't really need.

3. You expect to stay in the house for your lifetime, with flexibility as to when to sell.  The housing market goes up and down at various times, so you want to sell when its high rather than be forced to sell when its low.  Moreover, a more volatile housing market also means that the character of neighborhoods shifts rapidly.  In Ozzie  &  Harriet days, your nice suburban home surrounded by professional couples with kids would remain roughly the same for decades.  In the modern day, your nice suburban home can transform into the last bastion of decency in Crimeville seemingly overnight.

4. You expect an ever-expanding housing market.  While people will always need housing, the *type* of housing they need changes over time.  One of the major shifts that has occurred with demographics is that people aren't having nearly as many kids.  So while your grandparent's generation would be selling their home to a much, much cohort than they were part of, you'll be selling your home to one that is roughly the same size or smaller.  This lack of demand depresses housing prices.

It's still possible to make homeownership pay off - especially if you're in the right phase of your life - but it's no longer the obvious investment to make.  Depending on your circumstances, it might be wiser to put the money in a 401k/Roth IRA than it is to put it in a home.",eli5

Jersey sponsors are a way to earn revenue in spite of this constraint. 

American Football, baseball, and basketball by contrast have many breaks and/or instances when the clock is stopped. Therefore, broadcasters are able to schedule commercials throughout the games rather than just during half time.

24sak3,"Why didn’t soldiers use any obstacles in renaissance firearm battles? It is widely pictured that in the battles of those early firearms soldiers just stood still in the rows, battle taking place in some plain field. My question is – why didn’t they use any obstacles like trenches or even shields fixed to the ground while in the long range combat? Was it some sort of wicked knighthood thing of honor?","Also note, the first wars where firearms were rifled on a large scale, the casualty rates were astronomical and generals realized, tragically slowly, that standing in ranks was no longer viable.

While the Revolutionary War did see the use of rifled weapons, specifically the Kentucky Long Rifle, these weapons were used by specialists while the regular army, the dudes standing rank on rank, were still using smooth bore by and large.

In the U.S. Civil War you see the use of the soft lead mini ball in rifled weapons used on a mass scale. These weapons were highly accurate by comparison. You begin seeing the beginnings of two new modern paradigms in war because of the widespread use of these weapons. One of them defensive,and one of them offensive.

1) trench warfare (Vicksburg, St Petersburg Campaign, cold harbor)

2)Fire and maneuver warfare (especially with breech loading carbine armed Cav troopers, but also in small unit actions in the Wilderness)

So really, to answer your question. They stood in ranks because they COULD. The fire wasn't as murderous as you would think due to wild inaccuracy. In the civil war, generals begin realizing that modern weapons have shifted the way wars can be fought, unless you are prepared to absorb ridiculous casualties, and they began to change their tactics accordingly. 

Sadly, while the next big defensive jump in war, Trench Warfare would take hold in the next major American war (WW1, sorry Spanish war) while offensive tactics would lag behind. Again, we see generals using outmoded tactics against modern weaponry, and again we see them absorb huge casualties in learning their lessons. The lessons to emerge from THAT war would be the use of combined arms offensives, the solidification of fire and maneuver as a primary means of attack, as well as Armored warfare (Tanks).",eli5

Example round trip Helsinki-Prague with Lufthansa is 180 EUR, while flying one-way from Helsinki-Prague costs 428 EUR. What gives? This is far beyond my understanding.","Because they can.

Airlines set their prices not based on cost but on what the market will pay.

People buying flights with their own money most often fly round trips and are more flexible with the timing and price sensitive, leading to real competition.

People buying flights with their company's money because they travel on business often fly one-way, are not flexible with timing and not price sensitive in the same way people are with their private money.

In fact, corporate gudelines will say things like ""take the cheapest flight that fits with the schedule"" - this might be more than twice as expensive than the round-trip, but it may not show up because a one-way was searched. If the company pays anyway, people tend not to become creative.

I believe that depending on tax rules and your corp guidelines you may even be discouraged from buying a round-trip for half the price and just not taking the flight back, as company-paid, not-taken return flights might look like as hidden benefit to the employee.

10ramt,Why are there 720p movies of 750MB and 5.5GB if the 750 looks seemingly as good as the 5.5GB? What's the difference? ,"Video compression works by throwing things out.  The trick is to only throw out the bits that you won't miss.  There are lots and lots of settings that determine what gets thrown out and when.  If you use transcoding software like handbrake with the default settings, the converted video will look good, but it won't be all that small.  You can start playing around with these settings, but unless you know what you're doing, the video may come out even bigger or it might look bad.  It takes practice and effort to know what to change for what types of movies.

To get *really* small (under 1.5GB) 720p rips that actually look good, you need to adjust these settings not just for the whole film, but from scene to scene.  This requires a lot of work, and getting it right is almost an art.  But no matter how good someone is at it, the h.264 codec is still not perfect and you're still throwing things out to make the video small.  Some people are more sensitive to the distortions caused by this extra compression.  You may not notice the difference (or at least not enough to ruin the experience), but others might.  So between the effort involved and some people still not liking these super-compressed rips, they're not very common.

But there is hope.  The Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has [recently finalized the specifications](_URL_0_) for a new, better compression scheme called h.265.  It is said to be twice as efficient as the current popular codec, so in the future, visually-identical 720p videos can really be half the size they are now without all the effort that is currently required.",eli5

cga9zi,How did the tip culture in America become so prominent + the unwritten rules for tipping.,"In the mid-1800s Americans discovered tipping habits in Europe and brought them back to America. Shortly thereafter Europe ended their tipping tradition but it was just picking up steam in America. It may have died out after a couple decades if nothing drastic had changed (because tipping was seen as elitist and was outlawed in a few places because of that), but in 1870 the slaves were freed by the 15th Amendment (of the U.S. Constitution). 

Slaves now were free and they needed jobs that didn’t require much education. They got jobs as waiters, servants, barbers, railroad porters, etc. These were pretty much the only occupations available to them. Employers found that it was more profitable to literally not pay former slaves anything ($0) and simply required customers to leave a small tip after the former slaves performed their service. 

Eventually race relations in the U.S. evolved but tipping laws never did. In 1938 Congress finally passed a law requiring employer wages and tips to add up to an hourly minimum wage. So if you only earned $1 in tips and minimum wage was $3 an hour, your employer would have to pay a tipped worker the other $2. This is still the law today.",eli5

Please enlighten me.,"A lot of people think that big business doesn't like government making rules for their business (""regulation""). But weirdly enough, big business people *write* a lot of the rules that government passes. And big business spends a lot of money supporting lawmakers who pass those rules.

What's up there? If they don't like rules why do they write them and support them?

The problem with having a lot of complicated rules is that it's hard to make sure you are following them all. It's expensive. You have to hire lawyers and compliance experts and other people to tell you how to follow the rules.

Imagine if football or baseball got hundreds of new rules every year, and all the teams had to hire lots of extra coaches to teach the players how to play by all the new rules. Well, the *very rich* teams wouldn't have a big problem with that. They can afford to hire all those extra coaches. But the *not-so-rich* teams would have a big problem, because they can't afford the extra coaches. They would spend so much on trying to figure out the new rules that they wouldn't have any time to practice throwing the ball. And *new* teams, who were just learning the game, would have more and more to learn before they could compete.

And who are the very rich teams competing against? The not-so-rich teams and new teams.

Big business doesn't compete against government. It competes against small and medium business; and new businesses (startups) — which always start small. Regulation increases the cost of business, but big businesses can afford that better than small ones. And big businesses have the influence with government that lets them help write the rules so they aren't as much affected by them as their competition.",eli5

An option means that you enter into an agreement with a vendor to purchase a given item at a given cost at given point in time, i.e. in January you would agree to purchase two tulip bulbs 1st of June at a cost of 4,000 Dutch guilders. Different categories were also created, meaning you held an option for a certain category of tulip (e.g. solid red colored or white with red stripes, the latter which was considered the most rare and thus valuable).

5r622d,Why did the USSR suffer significantly higher casualty rates during WWII in comparison to the other powers? ,"After Nazi Germany and the USSR signed a non-aggression pact and divided Poland in half, Stalin knew the clock was ticking. Given Hitlers ideology of extreme nationalism and socialism, compared to the ideology of the USSR; it was quite obvious that the two could NOT co-exist. Especially when they're neighbor's. And here's is World War II favorite pun: Stalin agreed to the non-aggression pact because he was staling. 

Anyway, to answer your question, after Hitler conquered Norway, Denmark, and France, he turned his eyes towards the land of the bear. He waited for spring (Napoleon tried to invaded Russia during winter, he lost 90% of his army) and initiated Operation Barbarossa (red-beard). He figured the not so industrialized USSR could not match the industrial power of Germany. To his dismay, the Red Army switched to the tactic known as Scorched Earth, meaning they would burn everything as the Germans advanced in an attempt to slow them down until winter. It worked. But along the way, Germans captured many who weren't a part of the ""Aryan Nation,"" and sent them off to concentration camps to either work them to death or systematically murder them.  

But another reason why the Russians lost so many was because Stalin didn't really want his troops to retreat in the battle of Stalingrad. So as I mentioned earlier, they slowed down the Germans until winter. Hitler could not achieve his goal of a quick conquest, so he logically changed tactics, he went after the oil reserves that Russia had. If the Germans captured the oil reserves, the Russian military would essentially be impotent. Located in the south of Russia, Germans advanced that way. But Stalingrad was in the way. Because this city determined who'll control the oil, Stalin ordered his troops to not take a step back. Troops were ordered to shoot any Russian who retreated. By the end of the war, an estimated 30% of Russian troops were killed by their own (I recommend watching ""Enemy at the Gates"").

This is why serious historians say that the true victors of WWII were the Russians. They lost 56 million people, half were citizens who were victims of genocide, German atrocities, and German bombs.",eli5

wyv1v,"The Israeli situation, and why half of Reddit seems anti-israel Title.

Brought to my attention by the circlejerk off of a 2010 article on r/worldnews","This has been answered in this sub Reddit many times before, here is a copy paste of my previous answer:

A group of people called Jews lived in a neighborhood called Judah. They have been living in the neighborhood for a thousand years and they built most of the homes in the neighborhood.

A group of people called Romans takes over the neighborhood by force. They allow the Jews to stay as long as they follow laws set up by the Romans. The Jews find the laws very oppressive and rebel. The Romans crush the rebellion and make up even harsher laws. The Jews rebel again and are crushed again. This goes on several times until the Romans finally decide to kill most of the Jews and enslave the rest. They kick all of them out of the neighborhood and rename the neighborhood after a very old enemy of the Jews that was defeated by them many hundreds years ago and no longer exist. The new name of the neighborhood is Palestine.

After many long years the Romans are defeated by a different group and that group takes over the neighborhood. Some of the Jews return, but they are still very weak and there are very few of them. Most of the Jews remain in lands previously occupied by the Romans and are treated very badly there. They suffer constantly from discrimination, violence and killing. All this time the Jews hope to get stronger and get back to their old neighborhood and reestablish themselves there.

The neighborhood changes hands several times over the next one and a half thousand years. Meanwhile a new Idea rises amongst the people in the world. According to this idea every group of people should have the right to their own neighborhood and they should not be ruled by a different group of people. Many groups follow this Idea and establish their own neighborhoods. The Jews see this and establish a movement that will allow them to get back to their neighborhood. They call it Zionism.

During this time there is a war between one group called the British and another group called the Turks. The Turks currently control Palestine. The Jews offer their help to the British and the British promise to allow them to live in the neighborhood in exchange for the help, if they win. The British win the war and get control of the area that also includes Palestine. They allow the Jews to come live in Palestine.

The people who currently live in Palestine are called Palestinians. They have been living in the neighborhood for a very long time, probably more then a thousand years. While they never owned the neighborhood they paid rent to those people who did.

The Palestinians do not wish to share their neighborhood with the Jews. They attack the Jews. The Jews attack back. The British see there is violence in their neighborhood and decide to stop allowing Jews to come to the neighborhood.

Meanwhile, a group of people called Germans decide they hate the Jews and want to kill them all. They start killing millions of Jews. The Jews in Palestine beg the British to allow their friends from europe to come to Palestine to escape the Germans but the British allow for only a small and insignificant number to come. The Germans succeed in killing about a half of the entire Jewish population.

The other groups of people see what happened to the Jews and decide that the Jews need to get their own country to be safe. They put pressure on the British until they agree. They send people into the neighborhood to decide how to divide the neighborhood between the Jews and the Palestinians. The Jews meet with those people, but the Palestinians don't even agree to meet with them. The Palestinians say that this land is entirely theirs and the Jews should go away.

The world then decide the neighborhood should be divided between the Jews and the Palestinians. The Jews agree with the decision even though they get much less of the neighborhood then the Palestinians. The Palestinians however are very angry and are not willing to agree with anything. They call their friends from other places and attack the Jews trying to completely kick them out of the neighborhood. However the Jews win and even take parts of the neighborhood that were supposed to go to the Palestinians.

The Palestinians and their friends constantly attack the Jews. The Jews also attack the Palestinians. The Palestinians then convince their friends to start a very large attack on the Jews, however, before the attack is ready the Jews attack and take they rest of the neighborhood for themselves. This is called the 6 days war.

The Jews now control the entire neighborhood. They take more and more land that was supposed to go to Palestine. The Palestinians attack the Jews but they are now very weak while the Jews became very strong. Their friends are not willing to take the risk and help them. The Jews then attack the Palestinians back and kill many of them. They also build a large wall around the Palestinian houses and not allow the Palestinians to get through the wall.

The Palestinians see that asking the Jews to leave the neighborhood completely will never achieve anything. So the Palestinians ask the Jews to give them the parts of the neighborhood the Jews took in the 6 days war, and then they will have peace with the Jews.

The Jews are not willing to give the Palestinians all the land taken in the 6 days war. The Jews are only willing to give the Palestinians a small part of the land. They say it is the Palestinians fault for not agreeing with them earlier. The Palestinians are angry about that answer and so they attack the Jews again and again, and the Jews strike back at them every time. Also, the Jews put a lot of their people in houses they build on the land the Palestinians want.

The world is tired of the Jews and Palestinians killing each other for so long. They just want peace and quite. They want the Jews to agree to give the Palestinians the land they took in the war. However there are a lot of Jews now living on that land and the Jews are not willing to give large areas of it back. They tell the Palestinians that if they want peace they should agree to have a small part of that area. However the Palestinians don't agree with this and say they want the entire area taken in the war.",eli5

I noticed when doing serious crunching like compressing a video the CPU is maxed out 100% and stays that way until it's done with its task but when I startup the computer it takes a full minute to get up and running but the CPU never goes about 50%.  It doesn't make sense to me.,"Most  of the stuff that your PC does to start up is not computationally-intensive.  There's just a lot of moving files from your hard drive into RAM, which is fairly slow, and the CPU doesn't need to be at 100% to do that.  It just goes as fast as it can while waiting for the hard drive to catch up.

By contrast, compressing a file is *all* about the CPU and RAM.  The hard drive is not involved until after the compression is complete, and the compressed file is written back out.  So the CPU can go at full speed without having to wait on the slow hard drive.",eli5

That itching is called pruritus in the medical community. Scratching helps relieve pruritus by producing a small amount of pain. The nerves at the site of the injury send the pain signal to the brain *instead* of the itching sensation, so you temporarily feel relief. 

A [study](_URL_0_) published in 2014 demonstrated that when that pain signal reaches the brain, the chemical serotonin is released, and may actually cause increased sensation of pruritus. This is currently thought to be the reason scratching can make pruritus even worse.",eli5

33ayoj,How did language develop? ,"No one knows for sure, but it's likely that a primitive communication system similar to what other primates use became more complex over time. Some primates have certain calls that mean specific things, like ""danger"" or maybe even something more specific like ""danger-tiger"". 

If human ancestors had a system like this, it could have grown more complicated, having a lot of different calls, or words, for different things. At some point we began to organize these words into grammar. Probably primitive grammar at first, but gradually growing more complicated. Our intelligence as a species is probably what allowed language to get so complex. All this speaking also prompted biological changes, dramatically changing the anatomy of the throat and mouth to allow for more speech sounds and easier communication.

As I said, no one knows; this is just my non-expert opinion on what I think is a likely theory. Other people might say language is just a side effect of high intelligence and that the changes to our oral anatomy weren't caused by communicating a lot, but were caused by something else and as a side effect we can communicate better.",eli5

pyikc,"Why is the price of gas so much more fluid than any other good we purchase? What makes the price of gas jump up and down so often but any other product we buy inflates at a slower rate.

All basic materials and goods (sugar, coffee, corn, soy, beef, etc) are traded on commodities markets, but starbucks doesn't increase and decrease the cost of a coffee by a few cents each week. ","It changes often because the profit on gasoline is so thin and there is no way to spread that out. Most of the stations are franchised or lease the right to the brand name. That means that the station owner will lose money if the cost of the new shipment goes up by say five cent. Couple that with four stations on opposing street corners, and knowing that most people will go to whatever station is convenient, and the price can change twice in one day. 

Let's make this an example involving actual five year olds. I have a lemonade stand on the Southeast corner of Elm and Maple. I also sell high profit items at my lemonade stand like porn and crack. I know that if I can get people to buy my lemonade they may buy crack from me. I only make one cent per glass of lemonade, but I make $1 for every porn mag I sell. I make $40 per gram of crack. 

Let's say Shelly sells beer and pot on the Southwest corner. Shelly makes her money on the beer and pot. She makes 2 cent per glass.  

Charles is on the Northwest selling lemonade also. He makes his money with lottery tickets and condoms. Charles is making a penny a glass of lemonade. 

Doris sells lemonade, pencils, and Ecstasy. Doris makes about a penny and a half selling her lemonade on the Northeast corner. 

We each pay our lemonade supplies what they ask for the cost of the lemonade. They are all made from Florida lemons. They are all lemons, water, and sugar. The cost of lemons is flat. The cost of labor is the same for everyone, only subtle market changes in the cost of lemons changes. 

We each want someone to come to our lemonade stand for the extras we sell, but we each know that most of our customers will only stop for a glass and move on. So we keep the prices about the same and only change when our supplier changes his price. Best of all would be if I could get more people to buy crack from me when they want lemonade, but I know that if I set my lemonade price too high they will smoke pot or buy lottery tickets.",eli5

Why is that?,"Hi, I'm a dog and I use my tail to communicate strong emotions such as agitation, annoyance and anger as well as happiness. I should tell you that a person can get bitten by me even though I may be wagging my tail because I read the signs incorrectly. And make no mistake, there is a science to my tail wagging.

This furry mass of bone serves multiple purposes for me. The first purpose of my tail is for balance. It prevents me from toppling over as I make my sharp turns while running or swimming. The tail also balances me when I am walking along narrow structures, climbing or leaping. According to my parents, over time, our tails have adapted themselves to playing a vital role in communication, particularly when we we are just walking or standing around.

When I was a puppy, I did not always wag my tail. It wasn't until I was almost a month and a half old that I noticed I could communicate with my brothers, sisters and mom with my tail!

However, if you look at the great multitude of so-called secondary metabolites, most of them are poisonous to either viruses, bacteria, fungi or other microorganisms, or insects, or even other plants.

So, if some substance from plants is a poison to us, it's accidentally so, and the target was another organism. Examples: nicotine is first and foremost an insecticide, nematistat, and herbicide; aconitine, atropine, caffeine are insecticides; many essential oils (causing allergies in human) are antimicrobial and so on.
This has also to do with the fact that nerve cell physiology has not much changed since they developed in the first multi-celled animals, and poisons for insect nerves have at least some effect on human nerves.

Basically this is a principle that states that in order to achieve higher levels of comfort such as self-content, one must have the most basic levels of comfort such as shelter and security. A blanket provides a type of security that makes it easier for your animal brain to calm down at night and fall asleep.

The data either gets held back somehow in the consoles/computers, the routers, whatever hardware the ISPs use to route internet traffic, or the data is sent from player to player in such a round about way that it travels tens of thousands of kilometers even when playing with people in the same city. 

And a bonus question: In the future will there be technologies that will get latency closer to the theoretical minimum?

Sorry if this is to tough to explain to a 5 year old.","This is simplified, so excuse me if I miss a few things or get some steps out of order.

Say you're in an FPS game.  You see a guy and decide to shoot at him.  You click your mouse to fire.

Your computer picks up this signal from the mouse and translates it to a click.  This click is then processed by the game application as ""fire.""  The game calculates your current position, your weapon, what properties it has assigned to the ballistics, and then fires the gun.  The game encapsulates this information into a stream of network packets and sends it off to a server somewhere which is hosting the game.  Along the way it travels through routers, modems, switches, and all sorts of tech to get to the final server.

The server picks up these packets and analyzes them, processing that you pressed ""fire.""  It then takes the trajectory of the bullet and matches it against where other players are in the game, and calculates whether you hit them or not.  It deducts that health value from the player you hit (congrats!), updates their relative position, and sends all of this information (locations and health) back to your PC.  The packets go through the same series of network stuff back to your PC.

Your PC takes these packets, sends them to the game application which analyzes them, and processes that click of your mouse to fire.

All of the above takes time - time that translates into a delay between when you pressed fire and got the result.

BONUS QUESTION: Sure.  Faster computers, faster tech, light computing, etc.  But there will always be *some* delay no matter what.",eli5

This is a range of a number of 1 to 3ish degrees that your house is allowed to deviate before the thermostat turns the AC on or off.  If your thermostat is set to 70 to start, it may be as warm as 73.  This may feel uncomfortable to you, so you set the thermostat a little lower to 69.  This forces the AC to turn on, then the swing value allows the temp to fall as low as 66.  This change of 6 degrees is very noticeable.  If you want a tighter temperature range, most digital thermostats have an option to change the swing value.  Just be aware that narrowing your temperature range will cause your AC to cycle on and off much more often and this is neither energy efficient nor good for the AC unit.",eli5

Essentially what this means is, they sit really high up at the [very top of your lung](_URL_0_).

Paralysed vocal cords: impinges upon (pushing on/compressing) the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is responsible for controlling the intrinsic muscles of the larynx - i.e. the muscles responsible for sound production.

Shoulder pain: often due to the tumour impinging upon the brachial plexus, a network giving rise to all the nerves supplying the arm.

2odei0,"Why does the ionosphere interfere with spacecraft communications on reentry but not during launch? I was just watching the Orion launch, and someone created a GIF of the onboard camera.  Presumably this camera data was being transmitted back, and it showed the rocket launching through the clouds and into space.  I recall from Apollo 13 that there was a period during the capsule re-entry where the ionosphere (I may be mistaken) interfered with communications to cause a few tense moments of silence.  Presumably also a launched vessel will have to pass through that region, and yet the Orion gif shows no missing footage.  Was it downloaded to earth after passing through, or had something to do with speed, or?  Thanks!","It is not the ionosphere that causes the blackout. It is the superheated plasma around the capsule caused by high speed reentry. When going into space, we get outside the atmosphere before we build up that much speed. When coming in, you can just use friction rather than fuel that you need to carry for the whole journey to slow down.

ou3ro,"Why do both of these images exist? Image 1: _URL_1_

Image 2: _URL_0_","They're both dishonest.

The first image takes the national-debt as a fixed amount -- probably the debt held by the public if I place the number correctly -- and says ""this is how much all presidents in history before Obama borrowed.""  That's blatently false; we have borrowed a good deal more than that but we've paid down a good chunk of it with high tax rates, particularly after WWII.  

It then compares that value to the FORECAST increase in the national debt caused by all US policies (Obama's or otherwise) during Obama's term.  Some of those forecasts are based on worst-case-scenario numbers and many of them are the result of policies put into place by the Bush, Clinton, and Reagan administrations.

So the first image compares apples to motor-oil, really.

The second is also dishonest.  It portrays the percentage increase in  debt under each president.  So if (and I'm making these numbers up) Clinton ended his term with $5 Trillion in debt and Bush increased it by 115% that would mean that Bush increased the debt by $5.75 Trillion, bringing the total to $10.75 Trillion.  Obama could then increase that by 16%, which would be $1.72 Trillion.  Clearly the use of percentages makes the difference between Bush and Obama's debt increases seem much bigger than it really is.

Furthermore, note that the Obama figure does not consider the future of his Presidency but it does compare him to the full terms of other Presidents.  It would be more honest to portray it as an average value per year.

Of course, all of those ignore the fact that the economic realities facing Clinton (boom times) and Obama (neigh-on-depression) dramatically influenced the debt.",eli5

Often I feel like something like a heated pool that can be between 25-30 degrees (C) feels much warmer than the outside temperature we would be experiencing. Why does this happen?",Thermal Conductivity is a materials potential to conduct heat. The thermal conductivity of water is about 10^-.3 where as air is about 10^-1.7. This make air much less able to transfer heat therefore 30c water feels warmer than 30c air bc you were warmed by it more/faster. Hope this helps. :),eli5

What folks are saying about nets is true. There has also been a TON of engineering and design work put into the jet engines that prevents a bird shot from damaging the actual engine. It allows the fan blades to break, but prevents them from going deeper into the core, causing millions of dollars in damage/causing a fire.

Also, the actual risk of a bird shot is fairly low, most birds cruise at or below 10,000 feet, so a plane only has a risk of hitting birds during take off and landing in most scenarios. That being said, a hit during take off is much harder to navigate than one during landing.

First of all, you don't have to use those symbols.

It's just convenient to use the symbols next to your mark to communicate to the public and competitors that the mark is registered. Lets people know you mean business, so to speak.

As for why you'd get a trademark when you could just use copyright, while certain trade marks can sometimes be protected by copyright, many marks cannot because they are too short or don't have enough originality or can't be copyrighted at all (like colours). Also, while copyright lasts a very long time, it does run out eventually. If you keep paying for a trade mark, you can keep it forever (as long as you use it regularly).

Also, trademarks also protect more than just your mark. Trade marks protect you from things that don't copy your mark, but just look or sound similar, so you can control more things than just what you registered.",eli5

1ugezy,"why does my body need various metals like zinc, iron, manganese, etc? How does my body process these metals? ","What the layman understands as 'metal' with 'metallic' properties (a certain look, feel, taste, electrical conductivity etc.) only exists when there are large quantities of the specific metal atoms that form special metallic bonds. 


In the body, where metallic atoms are required in very very small quantities ('trace elements'), they are usually present in single-atom form and thus do not show any 'metallic' properties. As single-atom elements, they perform duties much like any other element that you need to survive: Because of their specific properties and interaction with other elements, your body uses them in the construction of specific proteins with specific forms and functions. An iron atom, for example, makes it easier/possible for a protein to bind/unbind oxygen atoms, therefore iron atoms are used in the construction of hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen in your blood. 


Because our supply of trace elements usually comes in the form of other organic material, they are already present in single-atom form, so the body has no need for mechanisms or enzymes that break down metallic matter (although some exist). That's why metals aren't considered foodstuff, and you don't crave for them, even though your body needs some of the atoms they are made of.",eli5

50jh4z,Why do students do better with a physical textbook vs an eBook or digital text? ,"Im no expert, But I do know a bit about memory so here's my understanding: 

Generally speaking, when it comes to learning, the more effort put into the process, the easier it is to remember the information. A physical textbook has greater physical and semantic presence, and can be interacted in a more direct and meaningful way then a web page. 

This ultimately means that the information learnt from a textbook has a a greater level of semantic interconnectivity (as more actions were required to learn the new information)  and thus has a greater number of neural paths leading to that information, making it more likely that the information will be retained. 

Likewise, reading off of a screen requires relatively much less effort, and whilst the same number of sense are used compared to reading a textbook, they are used much less heavily. This causes it to be 'lazy learning'- theres little effort put into it, so the information taken in from a webpage isn't going to form as many associations with existing memories in your head, meaning you'll forget quicker",eli5

37ulg4,Why do we remember some skills (e.g swimming and cycling) our whole lives? Went to community pool yesterday with my friends after 5 years. Swam like a pro. Then this question struck me. ,"It's called procedural memory. More specifically, it's 'muscle memory' or 'motor learning' which is a type of procedural memory.

Your brain's cerebellum, in particular, is very good at encoding sequences of muscle movements into long-term memory storage.

Procedural memory is very robust. Even people with dementia and amnesia often still retain procedural memories for skills like playing a musical instrument or riding a bicycle without any conscious effort.

Interestingly, for people with anterograde amnesia (a condition characterized by the inability to form new memories), it's still possible for them to learn new motor skills and encode them as procedural memories.

In other words, you can have someone with anterograde amnesia learn to ride a bicycle (as just an example) for the first time in their life and each day you get them to ride they will have no recollection of ever riding before, but each day they will continue to get better and better at riding the bike.",eli5

30331s,"Why are Americans (in general) so against a standard, national education curriculum, where every school in the country is on the same level? For example, in high school I moved from a state with one of the shittiest education systems in the country to a state where education got prioritized. I struggled at my new school because my old school seemed to do the ""bare minimum.""

Many countries around the world have nationalized education and take great pride in it. Many of these countries are kicking our ass in education.

Common core seems to be the answer for now, but the backlash against it is astounding.","Another major part of the problem is that ""common curriculum"" often gets translated to ""lowest common denominator"". Common Core is behind the elimination of GATE and Advanced Placement classes across the country. It essentially determines ""average"" and then dictates that all children learn at that level. It's great for the average kids in the middle, but does a grave disservice to those who perform above or below that level. 

My youngest sons public school implemented Common Core two years ago. He read the entire textbook and mastered all of the classes content within the first two weeks of each semester, and ended up being used as a ""peer tutor"" by his teacher. He wasn't LEARNING anything, and was being used as free labor to help the overworked teacher who was forced to spend most of her time with the below average kids in the class. By the end of the year, my son was bored with school and his grades were plummeting. 

This year he's in private school. No Common Core garbage there. He's once again a straight A student.",eli5

Is there anything to it?","A friend at work explained this to me (I almost never watch soccer outside of World Cup/Olympics) the other day in a really great way.

In a game like basketball, drawing and playing up a foul will get you (at best) 2 points, and maybe put an opposing player on the bench, and his sub brought out.  In a game that goes to a hundred points often, that's not a huge deal.

In a game like soccer, drawing a foul and playing it up will get you (at best, situationally) a penalty kick and an opposing player sent off.  Which means you might score a point, and the opposing team now plays with 10 players, while your team still has 11.

If you compare the value of a decisive foul in soccer to basketball, that best-case soccer foul means you get to make a free throw worth 50 points and one guy on the other team can't use his left hand.

3mry6n,"Why is debt sometimes good? [This comment](_URL_0_) on /r/AskReddit mentioned essentially that a nation's economy is *nothing like* a household economy. I was a bit confused by this in general, and more specifically wondered about some subsequent comments that suggested that *most* people grossly misunderstand what debt is to a country like the United States and why it is very necessary. 

Help?","Fundamentally, issuing debt means you get money now instead of later, and pay some price for that. However, when you get the money now, you can *use* it, and specifically use it in a way that will give you more money in the future.

For a household, you probably aren't going into debt to buy something that will help you make money later (if you are, debt can be good for a household as well). But a country is often spending money to do stuff that will increase the size of the economy, and thus the tax base, meaning its debt will give it more money in the future.

For instance, the US went into a lot more debt in the economic crash, but it spent that money on things designed to help mitigate the crash and get the economy on track again. When the economy grows, so does tax revenue. If the economy grows more than the interest on the debt, you've actually *made* money through your debt (and the US can borrow money basically for free).

Also unlike households, countries don't die. A person will eventually retire (hopefully), and will have a small income after that point. Countries don't. A country doesn't need to worry about whether its payments come out of its retirement money, because it doesn't retire.",eli5

6hxdww,Why do some people seem to always be cold and some people seem to always be hot?,"Has to do somewhat with gender and body type.

Females in general have a harder time maintaining their core temperature than males do because of how their dense muscle is arranged on their body.

As far as body type goes, fat (and muscle) are insulators.  I see a lot of skinny as a rail people who are always cold.  They have no mass to keep hear trapped in their body.  On the other hand husky or overweight people usually over heat easier because their is more mass to hold the heat in.

Also, blood flow is what keeps your extremities warm.  Anything that restricts blood flow to your hands and feet is going on cause them to be colder in average.

1to0zv,"Why does infra-red light feel ""hotter"" than other colours? Why does infra-red radiation feel ""hot"", while other colours of light, like green for example do not? If I had a radiant heater that just generated green light, but no infra-red, would it heat my house?","Infrared light is not visible due to its wavelength beyond that of what is visible to our eye. They use infrared light in those heaters because we can't see it, yet the light still touches our skin. Our skin then absorbs that light as heat, just like when we are hit by the light from the sun (the sun also emits infrared energy). 

They choose infrared because of its property of emission rather than reflection. The infrared light emits itself from a source and into the surrounding area, whereas visible light (like green) is reflected into color we can see, depending on the wavelength of the light. 

A heater based on green light may still produce some heat, but that light's energy wouldn't provide as much as infrared does.",eli5

794oqd,How camouflage patterns are created (and why UCP was bad vs MARPAT/CADPAT/MultiCam/OCP),"Let's do UCP first. My understanding is that the specific issue with UCP was exactly trying to get one pattern to fit all situations and ending up with one that fits everything poorly. An additional failure was a lack of pattern contrast (as you can see the colours are all very similar, ie. dull and kind of faded-looking), meaning the colours and patterns have too little contrast to effectively disrupt the outlines of an object or person covered with it. This means it basically fails to perform its primary function effectively.

The reason behind pixelated patterns isn't in camouflage, in fact it seems to have practically no effect. It is, however, easier to print and design. A matter of design and fashion, less than function. There are, I believe, claims that blotch would be more effective, but that's an unproven, and in my opinion false, claim.

There is computer software that can be used in designing camouflage patterns, so theoretically there is an infinite amount of patterns. Not all of them are practical or as effective, but yes, in much the same way as there are infinite different creations one could make with MS Paint, there is an infinite amount of theoretical camouflage patterns.

Measuring their effectiveness is an interesting question. Most commonly this is done by having soldiers observe a target camouflaged using the pattern and measuring how much time it takes to do so in different lighting conditions, angles and distances. This is a very realistic test (if the terrain matches the terrain of the area of intended use) and thus provides a good measurement on the effectiveness of a particular camouflage pattern.

And finally about colour schemes. In many cases you can use the old pattern, if the colour distribution in the new environment is the same. I'll use the Finnish M05 pattern as an example, because I'm familiar with that one. The colours and their relative amounts are derived from thousands of pictures of Finnish woodland (ie. the expected area of operations). The ""cold"" pattern of the M05 is a good example of using the same pattern with a different palette: the light green of the regular M05 has been replaced with a light grey colour, so it blends well with a frosty environment. Normally though, you wouldn't do this because the color distribution usually varies quite a bit from one environment to another. So you would likely achieve better results if you actually developed an entirely different camouflage for a desert environment than if you just took the old pattern and slapped a new colour palette on top, but it works well on the M05 because the forest is the same, the colours merely vary a bit. Just switching the colour palette might be reasonably efficient, though, if one can approximate the colour distribution well enough, and it would certainly prove cheaper.",eli5

4hqcdl,Why does it often take a couple listens to like an album?,"I don't think we fully understand why we enjoy music as much as we do, but research shows that our brains release dopamine when we hear a song that we like. When we hear a new song, our brains search our memory for similar patterns and try to predict where the song is going. People usually like songs (as shown by a release of dopamine) when the brain can find a familiar pattern (e.g. a similar melody line or rhythm). Listening to the same song gets old after a while, but listening to similar songs that are generally predictable but have some differences is rewarding.

That partially explains why it takes a while to get into a new album. You have to give your brain enough time to digest it and know where the songs are going before you fully enjoy it. That also explains why people tend to stick with the genres of music they grew up listening to.

Think of each song like a video or board game. It’s fun to play certain games, but playing the same ones gets old after a while. Playing new, but similar games is fun because you don’t have to re-learn all the rules, but there’s enough differences to keep it exciting. If you come across an entirely new game it could be fun, but you have to put in some work to learn the rules first.",eli5

They might not be in the most stable electron configurations but if there is nothing to interact with they dont care. When you bring them together though, they need more energy in total to maintain their less than ideal states than they would if they were to share their electrons in a molecular orbital so there is potential energy waiting to be released and also end up with a more stable configuration.

How likely that is to happen at a given temperature depends on how big and attractive their respective positive nuclei are and also how many full shells they already have, as the higher energy shells are less attracted by the nuclei.",eli5

61lx2h,Why do domestic (U.S.) cars have a reputation for being lower quality when compared to imported cars from Europe? ,"For a long time, American cars were often of lesser quality than Japanese and European cars, they had defects in manufacturing and used often substandard parts and processes to build cars--and they were known for it, everyone knew they just weren't as good, reliable, and such, even the companies making them, and they didn't do much to hide that.

  Producing cars, effectively, cheaply, and profitably is hard, and the process that was being used to make American cars produced a lot more quality issues than those produced elsewhere

There is actually an entire field of quality management / production operations pioneered by the Japanese called Total Quality Management (TQM) [Also called Lean, or Lean Six Sigma, or the Toyota Production System] Who's whole purpose was that it was cheaper, better, and more efficient to produce goods (in this case cars) with as little quality issues as possible. That is produce quality goods with no defects, over and over and over.

This system, through much investigation and research turned out to be crazy effective. And now it is used in manufacturing of just about everything across industries and around the world. This is the process that was used in Japanese car manufacturing, and to a degree, those in Europe as well

Now back to american cars.

Well, until the mid 90s, American cars were crap quality compared to many foreign ones, foreign cars used the system above and made quality cars with little defects, Americans did not, and had lots of issues. So the Americans took notice, and started changing their systems, the Japanese car companies even helped, it was a problem they all wanted to solve.

By the mid 2000s American cars were as quality as made anywhere else, and today, American cars are often even higher quality than anywhere else (although everyone is making great quality cars, so differences are small)

The stigma still sticks though, even though current, and last decade or so American cars are very high quality, and foreign cars are the same, American cars have not outgrown the old ideas that they are crap.",eli5
7lz4d1,Why would a company want to go Public? Why would you want to answer to shareholders instead of customers?,"There's an old joke that helps explain it. Old enough that the numbers are probably completely wrong, but this is the way I learned it:

* Up to $1,000,000 a year in sales, a company is run by its founder(s).

* From there up to $5,000,000 a year in sales, a company is run by its banker.

* After that, a company is run by its lawyers.

And the reason behind the joke is that the larger a business gets, the bigger the loans they want to take out, and the bigger the loan, the harder it is to borrow. A small business borrows money the way you would to buy a car or a house: the founder takes out one or more personal loans. He maxes out his credit cards, he takes out another mortgage on his house, he borrows money from every friend and family member.

But there's a limit to how big you can get off of that kind of informal lending. Sooner or later, you need to issue commercial bonds. Which you, as a non-banker, can't do. So you partner up with a commercial bank, and they underwrite your bonds. But first, they tell you what you have to do to your business to make it eligible to issue bonds, to make ratings firms willing to give you a decent rating.

If your business keeps getting more and more successful, there will come a time where no bank is big enough to underwrite the kind of commercial bonds you'd want to issue. You need to borrow more money than that. And there's only one way to do that: sell off part ownership in your company. But the legal requirements that are put on publicly owned companies are complex enough that, at that size, you have your own in-house legal department, or a are paying a huge retainer to a law firm. And from then on, you run every serious decision past them, so that they can tell you whether or not it would get you in trouble with stock market regulators.",eli5

3g7oxk,"Why don't white Americans rise up against police brutality like black communities do? It seems like black communities seem to be able to respond in massive ways to police brutality. And while the majority of black murders at the hand of police go unnoticed, it seems like almost no white murders are noticed. I know the media has a role but the media usually comes up AFTER black folks have taken some sort of action.","I think it's partly because we know that there isn't an onslaught of brutality that the media propagates. To really understand why officers act the way they do you have to understand what they see day in and day out. Recently on coontown a female corrections officer was explaining why she quit, in her post she told of how everyday the black community would masterbate in their cells as she walked past saying what they would do to her ect, she said she understood that the worst of all races were the ones in jail, but the nonblack inmates would never act in such a degradation way. So they have drawn the conclusion you have to be extra cautious around them. And statistically speaking blacks commit crimes more frequently than asians, indians, native Americans, whites, Arabs ect, and being a police officer you have the chance of being killed daily. They know how certain communitit's tend to act and are more cautious and alert, and possibly on edge when they think their life is in danger. To get back on track, the white community doesn't have this stigma, there are about 260,000,000 whites and of that population I think it's about 20% are arrested for violent crimes while blacks are the 12% of almost 400,000,000 and are convicted in somewhere around 52% of the violent crimes. So you are more likely to run into a violent black person than a white black person. Bottom line the black community is feeling the force of the law a drastically higher rates because they tend to have more negative confrontations with authority. White culture tends to look down on criminals and shunned them and feel ""that's what they get"" mentality for breaking the law. Not being black I can't honestly say how they view criminals, but based off the music and culture they propagate for everyone else to view it seems they aren't as harsh on law breakers within their own community. 

Not trying to trigger anyone, I understand their are possible billions of different opinions because we are all different, this is just one guys belief",eli5

236w5i,"Why do scabs get itchy? Is it not counter intuitive that the scab, which is part of the healing process, is really itch while your skin grows back?","There are several theories that explain why scabs itch. There are histamines in scabs that irritate the skin around the wound. Some doctors think this is the body’s way of getting rid of the scab which is no longer needed. When it itches, you scratch it and it is comes off. There is a flaw in this theory, because sometimes the scab itches before the wound is healed.

A second theory has to do with nerves in your skin that are cut when the skin is cut. When a wound is healing, the new skin is very thin, so the nerves are even more sensitive. As they are healing, their signals may be affected and the brain gets the wrong type of signal. The brain may interpret it as an itch and want to respond by scratching it.

Another theory is that as the wound heals, the scab pulls on the new skin, and that causes the area around the scab to itch.

Lastly, dryness could be a reason for itching. When the wound occurred, the skin, nerves, and oil glands were affected, and without oil, the skin would become dry.",eli5

4tpo0r,"why does heavy drumming and deep brass get us so pumped up? Is it just learned culture? Or something more innate? You see drumming, especially, in so many cultures, and it seems to always have the same effect on people. Is this just something we've been passing down as a society? Or does something happen to us when we hear certain kinds of music?","Listening to rhythmic drumming is one of the simplest and most effective ways to enter a trance-like/hypnogogic state. It's a practice that had been used in shamanism and religious ceremony pretty much since the beginning of mankind. 

The science behind it is that repetition of a frequency encourages the brain to operate at that same frequency. Right now, your brain is probably operating around 12-15hz. In a very deep sleep it's a around 4hz. Drumming (and chimes/bells) can be used to help change your brain between it's Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Theta states. 

If the drumming is pumping you up, it's because it's influencing your brain to a higher frequency. This is why at the end of a shamanic journey/session the drummer usually increases the tempo rapidly. Our heartbeat is also susceptible to the rule of synchronicity, so a fast drum beat with heavy bass can increase your pulse and literally get your blood pumping.

Edit: base=bass

Edit 2: So I was in bed when I wrote this comment from my phone. /u/kilopeter asked for some of the science behind my explanation, so here is some science. 

[A new study by Barry Quinn, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist specializing in neurobiofeedback for stress management, indicates that drumming for brief periods can actually change a person's brainwave patterns, dramatically reducing stress. Dr. Quinn operates a neurobiofeedback (NBT) clinic called the MindSpa Place in Colorado Springs, CO, and for more than eight years has been working with how a variety of techniques affect the brainwaves. He calls the results of 30 to 40 minutes of drumming on the highest-stress clients ""by far the most amazing results I have encountered thus far in my research"".](_URL_2_)

[...according to psychologist Annett Schirmer reporting new findings today at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in New Orleans. Rhythmic sound “not only coordinates the behavior of people in a group, it also coordinates their thinking—the mental processes of individuals in the group become synchronized.”...  :   ...The EEG recordings showed that the waves of brain activity (alpha and beta waves) became synchronized around the auditory rhythm. That is, the ongoing oscillations of brain waves became phase shifted so that the peak of the wave always occurred at a precise point relative to the next beat in the drum rhythm. Rhythmic sound synchronizes brain waves.](_URL_0_)

[This research supports the theories that suggest that the use of the drum by indigenous cultures in ritual and ceremony has specific neurophysiological effects and the ability to elicit temporary changes in brain wave activity, and thereby facilitates imagery and possible entry into an ASC (altered state of consciousness), especially the SSC (shamanic state of consciousness).](_URL_1_)

svk2e,"- Why I have to eat fruits and vegetables everyday to stay healthy, but an Inuit can go his whole life without ever seeing a vegetable? ","From wikipedia: 

 > While it is not possible to cultivate plants for food in the Arctic the Inuit have traditionally gathered those that are naturally available. Grasses, tubers, roots, stems, berries, fireweed and seaweed (kuanniq or edible seaweed) were collected and preserved depending on the season and the location.


 > Because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet.

 > Vitamins and minerals which are typically derived from plant sources are nonetheless present in most Inuit diets. Vitamins A and D are present in the oils and livers of cold-water fishes and mammals. Vitamin C is obtained through sources such as caribou liver, kelp, whale skin, and seal brain; because these foods are typically eaten raw or frozen, the vitamin C they contain, which would be destroyed by cooking, is instead preserved.

tl;dr: They do have access to some kind of plants, and many of the vitamins we usually get from plants are also found in the animals that they eat in abundance. In addition, Western diets require more of the nutrients in healthier foods to help the body deal with the higher amount of saturated fat that we eat relative to Inuits.",eli5

What does it mean and why is Buzzfeed hated for it?","Their title are very intentionally created to raise questions without answering them in the hopes you'll click. They also use now-cliched hooks like ""the answer will shock you!""

Buzzfeed wants your clicks so they can make their money.

Here's a headline and short description pulled from the BBC:

 > **Iraq swears in unity government**
Iraq swears in a new government with Sunni and Kurdish deputy prime ministers after weeks of deadlock, as the country struggles against Islamic State fighters.

It tells you what you need to know concisely. If you want details you're free to read the whole article, but what you're going to get in that article is made perfectly clear by that little headline and short follow-up.

Buzzfeed, on the other hand, raises more questions than it answers with a click-bait article headline. It's anti-content.

That said Buzzfeed is hardly alone in click-baiting; plenty of news agencies have done it and do it today too. Even the BBC has made some dubious article headlines in the click-bait tradition.

Also I hear people complaining about Buzzfeed being abject plagiarists and inane much more than about click-bait titles.",eli5

Communism is a strong form of socialism that envisages a future utopian world where money won't exist and people will make what they can and provide it to others, taking for free what they need from others. Of course this has ever existed.

Light carries energy which you usually don't notice until you get sunburn or step on a concrete tile heated by the midday sun. 

LASERS can concentrate lots of light energy on a small area where, if the energy is absorbed,  things get very hot. It is this heat that causes melting or burning to cut material.

Mirrors reflect most of the light energy that hit them but some energy will be absorbed, especially if the surface has dirt on it. Here are some websites showing damage to mirrors by lasers.

It's impossible to find any concrete information on this topic. Surely there must be a breakdown of costs available. An infographic would be great.

Why do we pay so much for Internet in the US compared to other countries like Sweden? Labor costs more there, yet providers still manage to turn a profit. I'm unclear as to what the US gov subsidizes, but it sounds like they subsidized part of the infrastructure, so why all  the fees. Also, just how long will it take to pay for these fees? 

People ask why ISPs are so expensive and then the common defense is overhead, peering, transit, maintenance, and redundancy costs. Fair enough, but how are providers in Europe with higher labor and infrastructure costs, and similar geographic coverage gaps (Sweden, Norway) able to turn a profit, offering similar, if not better, speeds. 

Is it possible that we are paying to offset the high costs of lobbying efforts or and loss of revenues from alternative streams such as TV? ","It has nothing to do with costs.

6qiusa,in medieval battles how did people know who is on their side and who needs to be killed. If it was as chaotic as in i.e. GoT depicts there is no way to tell who is who. ,"Everyone is mentioning uniforms, but that's incorrect. Having any form of uniform wasn't very common for a lot of histoey. Standing armies night have a mandated uniform and armor, and later on livery became common (even then, not everyone had one), but for most of history you bought your own armor and wore your own clothes. There was no uniform. Of course by medival times, on which game of thrones is based, livery was common. And it does show up in game of thrones with, for example, the very distinctive Lannister army gear. However, the fact that armies have only had uniforms or livery for a relatively short time but managed not to kill their own men even before that suggests that isn't the explanation. 

Instead, the problem is that game of thrones is really bad at depicting battles. Very little warfare in history involved skirmishes where everyone got into a giant mess and people paired off and fought their duels, with everyone else fighting around them. It looks awesome on tv, but it almost never happened. For starters, most warfare was seiges and maneuvers. You sit outside a town or castle until the people inside starve, or you lead a giant army and yell ""you better watch out or we're gonna attack"" and breathe a sigh of relief when the other guys slink away. 

When a battle did happen, it looked very different from battles on GoT. You didn't pair up and fight other people. Instead, your army forms a few lines, their army forms a few lines, and the two groups stand across from other and try to kill the other side while doing their best to not die. Some units might move around, cavalry might charge, arrows would be shot, but it almost never happened that the formation broke up and the battle broke down into a bunch of duels (if the formation did break, it's because someone was running *away* from the fighting). You fought the entire battle surrounded by your own men, which made it really easy to know who to kill. You kill the guys opposite you - the ones poking a spear in your face - and you don't kill the guy behind you. 

Now, skirmishes did happen of course. A unit might get isolated from their army, a small part of the formation might break down, a travelling group might get ambushed, a ship might be boarded, etc. But they were between small groups, not entire armies. You would know everyone on your side because you've been travelling and fighting with them.",eli5

The battery usually lots the electrons cross in a slow controlled manner which power the phone during the whole day.

In a faulty phone / battery, the electrons all try to cross at the same time, instead of a slow discharge that powers the phone for 12 hours, the same energy is discharged in less than a second, explosively.

5r3qyj,Why no major car brand will manufacture a small pickup truck? Seems like a huge opportunity for a company to offer a stripped down 4 cylinder truck for 12-15k marketed at younger buyer and foster a loyal following to buy nicer trucks in the future.,"I work for a Nissan dealer. We market the Frontier, which can be had for as little as 20k. It does not sell. Largely, this is due to the fact that a truck, to be useful, must have a body on frame design and a bed. Both of these kill gas mileage, which is a priority for most cheap vehicle buyers. In addition, the capability of a 4-cylinder in terms of towing and payload is so poor that most find the need to go to a 6 cylinder. At that point, the price starts to creep into the 25k range in a world where a (very) basic half-ton can be had in the low 30k range. Therefore, most go for a new half-ton (more money) or a used half-ton  (better capability). Keep in mind, this is with practically no difference in fuel economy. TLDR: Trucks cheap enough to be substantially less money than a full-size are practically useless, trucks that have the equipment to accomplish anything worthwhile are too close in price to a half-ton.",eli5

I have been interested in the Civil war from some time, and I am currently dating a girl from Arkansas. Everyone has been pretty biased on one side or another, so I am looking for an unbiased description of the events / cause of the American Civil War.    

Thank you for reading and for your time.","Slavery.

A bit of background:

There was tension between slave and free states since the revolutionary war (and before really).

There was a balance of power between the two groups in the senate since there was an equal balance of free and slave states so neither side could dominate.

As new states were admitted, there was a lot of jockeying to decide if this would be a free or a slave state which would give one side or the other more power and upset the status quo.

The solution to this was the Missouri compromise. This meant that states would be admitted basically two at a time, one free and one slave state. Sometimes this meant cutting prospective states in two to achieve the desired result.

This compromise broke down in 1854 which also destroyed one of the major parties of the time: the whigs.

From the ashes of the whigs arose the GOP, the republicans.

The GOP were a strongly anti-slavery party and in 1860 this fledging party won the presidential election giving the world Abraham Lincoln.

The support for the GOP was almost exclusively in the northern free states and it had almost no presence in the southern slave states.

The issue of slavery was critical to the 1860 election. It was the dominating issue of the time: would slavery continue?

Lincoln was aggressively anti-slavery and so the southern states split off to make their own confederacy and then in 1861 you have the civil war.

So slavery was absolutely central to the civil war.

Sometimes this is framed as ""states rights"" - what should be the balance of power between the federal government and the states, but this turn of phrase hides the fact that it was a *states right to have slaves* that was at issue.",eli5

In [this article](_URL_0_) it discusses how Johnson's proposed fiscal tightening of the federal government (tax reforms, forbiding the U.S. to run deficits, banning federal bailouts of states) and elimination of the Fed would result in a recession. I have a basic understanding of the Fed in an international finance context but beyond that I'm lost. Help? ","Short Answer: Prohibiting the federal government from running deficits prevents it from being able to respond to problems, like the great recession. Libertarians generally believe this is the way it should be, that the market must fend for itself 100% but, most people don't.

Long Answer: It basically represents a massive misunderstanding of how the world works. People often use the argument that ""my children and grandchildren will be paying off this debt forever"" but, it's just not true. 

Almost everybody has debt. Do you buy a house with cash or do you have a mortgage? Will your children be paying off that mortgage long after you're dead? Well only if you're stupid. Companies also have debt. They want to buy another company for whatever reason? It's often done with a loan. When manufacturing companies retool a plant or, build a new one, they'll often use debt to do it.

For government, it's exactly the same. When they embark on large infrastructure programs (like the interstate system), there's almost no way for them to come up with all the money they need, when they need it without massive cuts elsewhere, so they take out a loan.

The important thing to remember about debts and deficits is that, just like your personal credit, if you take out too much, you can get into a position where you can't pay it back and that's still bad (Greece, I'm looking at you). 

Now, you might be asking, the government keeps taking out loans to pay off the earlier loans they took out to pay for the earlier loans, etc., how do we ever pay off this debt? The answer is, it's not really necessary to pay off the debt, what's important is the debt to GDP ratio, which is like how much debt you have compared to your income. Let's say you make $20k a year and have $5k in debt, your debt to GDP ratio is 25%. Then you decide to go back to school and take out a loan for $20k to pay for it, now your ratio is 125% bad right? But with your new fancy schooling, you get a job that pays $200k, so now your ratio is 12.5%. Does that debt matter so much anymore?",eli5

I know that chords sound great and scales sound good, but is there any reason behind it that chords and scales are how they are?","A ""chord"" is made up of 3 or more notes. A note is a single sound, like when you whistle, that's a note. Sounds make waves, and that's what we hear. Imagine you're in a pool with water like glass. You gently tap the pool at one end with your finger, while a friend lightly taps the water at the other end at the same time. You'll notice the waves pass nicely and evenly- making a pretty picture. Now you cannonball into the pool, and you're friend belly flops at the end. Nothing about what you did was similar. Your friend's belly hurts, you're cramping up from eating too much. The waves in the pool are bouncing around, and the pool is a big mess. Your babysitter is soaked, and she's not happy. That's how chords work. Instead of waves in a pool, we have sounds. Some blend together, some don't. Everyone is trying to make the best picture out of their pool as they can. Part of it's cultural. Some people like a messy pool, some people like a nice clean pool.

38hk0z,Why is an audience member catching the ball such a big deal in baseball? ,"First, it has to do with the fact that baseball is one of the few sports in which fans get to take home part of the game. Hockey being another, which catching a puck has a similar excitement. Most other sports, the ball has to be returned to the field of play if it enters the stands.

Secondly, according to this article:

_URL_0_

About 30-40 foul balls enter the stands during an average game. This of course varies greatly each game, but even in a small-ish stadium of 10,000 fans, that gives you less than 1% chance of actually catching one of them. Now consider being at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles which holds 56,000 people and your chances drop even further. 

So quite simply, it's bragging rights. Catching one is like becoming the coolest kid in school with the toy that everyone wants, but can't have because the store sold out. You get to hold it up and say to thousands of people, ""look what I got and you can't have it.""

This is why fans make such a big deal about passing on a caught ball to another fan, such as a small kid. Or throwing back a homerun ball from the opposing team, such is the case at games played at Wrigley Field in Chicago. The act of passing it on is the ultimate sacrifice in the eyes of envious non-catching fans.

It's why reddit has 10m+users. Even if we don't seek attention or interaction in the real world, we can go into a place where we feel more free and get the same thing.

Even then craziest members of the darkest parts of the web connect to it for interaction.

Edit: When we were monkeys if we wandered off we died, those monkeys that didn't wander off got to live. Being lonely meant that you knew you should be back with your monkey friends because back in those times if you wandered off you had no sex, and you were too stupid of a monkey to understand that there is more to life than sex and eating. So you lived a half-life and died, not to make any babies with that mentality. Plus, lions eat you more if you are like ""fuck those trees, man..why don't we just walk out in the ope-*aaagh*""

Then the monkeys started walking upright, and it was good to go for a walk with another monkey. To avoid getting eaten by things. Plus, the brain was growing and it was like ""whaaaat"", maybe we should grow some food sometimes. Let's go plant some seeds together and eat the fruits and veggies together, so we can grow together and stuff.

Then we started making tools, which lead to agriculture, and we were like ""hey, you wanna help me work this field of wheat or whatever we grow"" and the homie was like ""yeah"" and then homies worked the ground together. About this time, there was one dude who was like ""i wanna play computer games."" and the homies were like ""ok, but if you dont help us work this field you're going to starve to death cuz we work hard for our money""

And the dude starved to death, while the homies with the wheat were getting mad pussy with the power of friendship and being able to feed all those kids and mad honeys.


The super pussy getters were having children, and they were happy because sex is good and it leads to kids that have sex with other kids and stuff, and that nerd(RIP) in his mom's stick hut basement died without having given birth because he didn't feel loneliness like others. He didn't provide a service in that world yet, so his genes didn't pass on that loner behavior yet because it was still not helpful.

But then the homies were like ""lets be kings"" and the kings made other people work their fields. So their kids were like ""i dont have to work fields. in fact. i dont have to do anything really. I hate other people"" and meals were brought to these kids, and they reproduced with each other many times.

Eventually their lineage grew too much for most kingdoms to handle and people were just commoners, with a hint of that ""i dont need people"" gene imbedded. And as we grow into this age of wealth abundant, there is a prevalence of that gene sprouting because now it can. 

Emotions keep us in check, its a good way of communicating to our homies in the fields with us exactly how we feel, so they can know how to help us to feel better so we can work those fields better and stuff. Also, as social creatures that have spent so long together we feel things like sympathy and empathy, which allow us to feel someone else's feelings. Sympathy is when you know that the other person is feeling a feeling and you wish they were not feeling that feeling. Some part of that might date back to wishing your homie was working this field more, but that is all speculation. Empathy is where you are feeling what they feel, or as close to it as your mind can imagine. This helps us to guide our social situations so that our homies don't stop working the field with us, but also because on some insane level, you feel as if you are them for a moment or so. You have left your emotional position for a moment to feel theirs. 

So that you can help them better work themselves back to the field is my superstition, but also because we are a creature that produces mood-changing chemicals all the time, and some of them are oxytocin which helps to feel love. And love in itself is a whole new conversation.

So, thats why we feel emotions...chemicals control us, so that maybe we can get those people to work that corn with us so we can eat this winter. But like, my feet hurt too, I get that, maybe we should invent shoes. Maybe after we work this corn we can get shoes. To be without people is to starve alone and be eaten by wolves and shit. Sometimes you need someone to come stab the bear that's on top of you. Sometimes you wanna put your penis in that woman. Sometimes you want people to work that field with you.

Edit 2: we also like the homie that tells us how to hit the other people, and when to do it. We also like the homie that invents shovels and stuff. Some of these homies aren't social creatures by nature but now their genes are being passed down because they are useful finally.

Fast forward to today and we have all kinds of homies. Homies that build homes. Homies that like other homies. Homies that like to be left alone. All can find some place here, even if it's 4chan.",eli5

35tksf,"Why will the sun get larger, hotter and more luminous as it ages in spite of using up its fuel source and having less hydrogen for fusion. ","As hydrogen fusion slows down, the sun's core contracts. This isn't a coincidence - the energy produced by hydrogen fusion is pushing out against the force of gravity, and the core's current size is the result of an equilibrium between the two. As it contracts, it heats up, so balance is maintained.

The problem comes when the core is so tightly packed that increasing the pressure does not increase the rate of fusion very much. When this happens, the core rapidly collapses because there's not a negative feedback to keep it propped up. It becomes much, much denser and much, much hotter, until it reaches high enough temperatures to begin to fuse *helium* into carbon and oxygen. When it does so, it heats up very rapidly, and the amount of energy released causes the sun to grow larger and brighter. Strictly speaking, the *surface* of the sun will actually be cooler, because the area expands more than the energy output does (so the energy per area is less).",eli5

Earth is a sphere,The sun is a sphere,molecules are tiny spheres,Atoms are spheres,electrons are spheres,WHY.","Who in the world told you that molecules are round? Here are some protein molecules _URL_0_ and of course, DNA is a double helix!

Celestial bodies are round-ish because gravity is pulling everything in towards the center; this acts on all of the sun/planet/thing equally, pulling it into a sphere. Note that other forces can work in other directions, the Earth is not a perfect circle and it actually bulges out in the middle.

Comets are not round; a famous recent comet was shaped kind of like a rubber duck. Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos, look like potatoes. These things are not heavy enough for the gravity-pulling-roundness to kick in.

Getting bigger, galaxies can have many shapes. Our galaxy is shaped like a big spiral with lots of arms, more like a jellyfish than anything else.

Cells can be many shapes, your nerve cells can be up to a meter in length and look like a branching tree, skin cells are shaped like shingles, sperm cells are tadpoles. Round cells are useful because this has the most interior volume for the least outer surface.

Atoms are pretty hard to take a picture of, the nucleus is probably actually lumpy (made of a bunch of protons and neutrons stuck together), and the electrons go around in a circle because they are orbitting the nucleus, but electrons are not so simple- they're not little beads floating around a lumpy pile of beads, electrons are fuzzy, more like a *place* than a *thing*.

6ne1as,"Why aren't most pre-2002 car airbags/inflators being recalled/replaced? Is it because they were safer, and, if so, why not make newer ones that way again? ","To quote _URL_0_, a recall is required 

 >  ""When a motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment (including tires) does not comply with a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard."" or ""When there is a safety-related defect in the vehicle or equipment."" 

Federal vehicle safety laws only apply to new vehicles. You are not required to retrofit an old car with airbags to keep it legal. This means that unless the airbags are found to have not been complying with airbag laws at the time the vehicle was made, they are not defective. The creation of new better airbags doesn't retroactively make the old ones defective. An airbag would only be defective if they didn't work as designed when they were produced.

Additionally, there is a time limit for free recall service. If a defect is discovered after the vehicle is 10 years old, the automaker doesn't have to fix the car for free. So if a 2002 car got recalled now, it would be up to the owners to pay for repairs.

Old airbags are probably not better than new ones. In order for a defect to be found in an old car, the car must have been on the road most of its life before the defect was discovered. This is very rare. Most defects are discovered in the first few years of a car's life. The chance of a new defect being found in an 8-15 year old car is very low.",eli5

Our existence on this world is dependant on a lot of different factors, and if you change them too much it wipes out a lot of life (but probably not all)

When an asteroid hits the earth the immediate area is devastated, but what it also does is through lots of dirt and dust up into the atmosphere. Those further away are fine to begin with, but all this dust blocks some of the light and heat from reaching the surface. This induces a mini ice age in which the planet cools down. Now whilst on the grand scheme of the lifetime of the planet this wont do too much, if you happen to be living on the planet when it happens your gonna have a bad time.

At first its ok, but then as it gets colder certain plants start to die off because its too cold for them. Any animals that eat those plants are then going to struggle and their numbers will dwindle. That then means there are less animals for the hunters to eat and so they start to struggle. All of this has a huge knock on effect that kills of entire eco systems.

Back to my first statement ""How does a bullet which is a fraction of the size of a human cause so much damage?"". The bullet itself only devastates the immediate area, however if it hits a major organ the entire system will eventually fail, or you might bleed out etc. End result is the same.

There are many other ways it can be devastating, its just one example

6hm207,Why can we turn our face red consciously but can't control the blood flow in other areas of our bodies? ,"We can control anything that is done by the contractions of muscles. 

So we make our face go red by either over contracting certain neck and face muscles or by forcing our ""breathing muscles"" to not contract.

You can make your leg go red by folding it with your leg muscles and leaning on it.

We can't directly change the blood pressure of any part of our body that doesn't have muscles to do it. 

If you don't have a muscle that can pull it, you can't do it.

Realistically speaking I can understand some of the reasons: in case of a meltdown the area would be uninabitable for thousands of years. Even if the meltdown is contained, that's about, it's contained, we can't rebuild it. Waste is hard to get rid of, not to mention the impact on the environment. I don't know the costs to build and maintain a reactor but I assume they're not small. But, again, realistically speaking, wouldn't the benefits outweigh the costs/dangers?

Long story short, why are we not using such an efficient energy source while using things like coal and so on?","Well first off it's not as simple as ""Light coal on fire, produce heat"" It requires a substantial amount of knowledge, and that knowledge is kept secret because it's dangerous.
* Step 1: Fund nuclear program
Secondly nuclear power plants are expensive, really expensive, plus you need highly educated workers
* Step 2: Front billions of dollars for reactor
* Step 3: Train or employ from other countries
Finally yes, it's super dangerous, one mistake and BOOM, worse any security lapse and you have uranium in the hands of dangerous people. 
* Step 4: NEVER SCREW UP

It's not worth it in poorer countries (or possible) to develop nuclear power, and for rich countries, they can't go 20 years without a nuclear incident. Also when you start dealing with lots of depleted Uranium, you need someone secure you can store it for 100,000 years. Finally Uranium doesn't have the highest energy density, I believe Thorium wins that prize by a good margin.",eli5

52e0n9,"Why, when ironing, it takes infinitely longer than the rest of the entire garment to iron out a crease you accidentally create? ","Clothing wrinkles when the fibers are creased. Usually this happens because of pressure, which causes folds in the fiber (think of crumpling a piece of paper).

Ironing/pressing works by using a mixture of heat and pressure to re-shape the fibers flat again. Heat is especially useful in re-shaping fibers.

When you accidentally iron a crease into your clothes, you're using both heat and pressure to re-shape the fibers into that crease AND make sure the fibers hold that shape better.

Moisture works to help loosen fibers so you can press them back into shape, which is why many irons come with a spritzer button and/or steam button. If you iron a crease into your clothes, spritzing it with water can help loosen the fibers you've just pressed so you can flatten them correctly.

EDIT: Since some people seem to be confused by and/or unsatisfied with this: I explained how irons work *because that explains why pressed creases are harder to remove than everyday wrinkles.* A pressed crease (i.e. one created by ironing) is set using the mixture of heat and pressure. In fact, irons are designed not only to remove wrinkles, *but to press creases* - it is one of the main functions of an iron to create creases that stay in place and are hard to remove. Pressed creases are not impossible to remove (like /u/Fastpitcher and I said, spritzing the crease with water will loosen up the crease and allow you to press it flat again), but the combination of heat and pressure is exactly what makes it harder to remove than a normal wrinkle.",eli5

81k6oe,Why are the majority late night shows left leaning?,"Because that's how humor works. Political satire is about poking fun at the people at the top, about questioning the status quo.

And that is inherently a left-wing thing to do.

Humor is, and has always been, a way to question authority and ridicule the rich and powerful. And those are the *last* things you want to do if you're right wing.

Right-wing ideology is about reinforcing the status quo, about how the people at the top deserve everything they've got, and the people at the bottom deserve their misery, and that is simply not good joke material.

Left-wing ideology is about saying that the people at the top don't deserve to be there. It is subversive. And you can easily build jokes on that premise, because jokes are about subversions, about screwing with people's expectations and questioning assumptions.

On the other hand, it is very easy to make right-leaning TV shows relying on anger and outrage. Right-wing ideology is at its core about comfort and stability. ""I like how the world is now, and so I despise anyone who would upset the status quo"". And so, all those pesky people who go around saying the world isn't great the way it is, you can talk for *hours* about how they're a danger to society and how someone should just run them down in a SUV and how they're lazy and jealous and looking for handouts. It's not funny, but it's *great* for channeling anger and outrage.",eli5

a6hxcl,Why would a national popular vote for President be a bad idea?,"It isn't so much that it is a bad idea in concept but that it isn't the system our country is built around. Broadly speaking the US is a republic where the power of the people is expressed through elected representatives. It is also the ""United States"" as in a union of separate state governments.

As part of that union the constituent states agreed to representation of a form that wouldn't allow the larger or more populous states to absolutely control the government. California for example has more than 12 times the population of Utah, so why would Utah agree to a union when every vote would tend to only be up to California?

To avoid this ""tyranny of the majority"" the representation was organized such that states can have influence different than raw population. For example every state gets two senators regardless of their size, while the House of Representatives is based on population. The members of the Electoral College for each state is the total of the House of Representatives and Senate, and the state can allocate them how they like to have their elections: Divided based on number of votes per candidate or winner take all.

But to your question, a purely popular vote wouldn't be unreasonable on its face but isn't what our form of government is and you certainly can't change the deal at this point.",eli5

It is harmful to democracy because it is generally used to empower groups or parties well beyond their actual support within the country.

- But if u sit down, and analyse from a literary perspective, he talks about things like racism, homosexuality, gender issues, powerplay, politics, love, hate, life. Everything. And he is persuasive too.

- He once talked about love (sonnet 18), he starts off by talking about summer and the sun, saying that he likes the sun and summer the warmth of it though sometimes they sky is cloudy, and in the same way human enjoyment is generally temporary and based on circumstance. Then he moves on to say that his love however, was an eternal summer, their happiness is everlasting and transcends the temporary nature of the world.

- As you can see, the ideas that come out of his works are simply unmatched by most others. Even looking at this poem he ends it with a couple of lines saying that as long as people are able to breath and see, then what he writes about his love will always be true. He means this in both a metaphorical and literal sense. He is saying that as long as people live and can read his words, then the beauty of his lover will forever be immortalized in his words, defying time and death. That their bodies is not what contains their love, but in the words and actions between them.

- There is simply so much to interpret. In 12 lines he talks about love, death, temporary nature of things, what loves means to two people, how you view your lover compared to the world, how love can last longer than our bodies. And the next 2 lines are separate from the first 12, not only does his 2 lines lie separate from what most of the poem talks about, but in the same way it tries to exclude this particular poem from all other works of art. Very meta.

- Also note that he follows 10 syllables per line, and rhymes every other line, and follows a particular speech patter of hard and soft syllables. Fucking maths, man",eli5

If you're asking why it's more common for men to propose, its a cultural relic left over from the days where women had far more to lose from a bad marriage than the man. Back in the day, Eurasian societies pretty much all had social structures where the woman became a part of the man's family and thereby left her own in the course of the marriage. Plus, virginity was something that was extremely valued in girls at this time, and getting married meant that you were probably going to give your virginity up. This arrangement worked out far better for the man, so it became customary for the man to ask the woman to marry him. The woman had more to lose, therefore she or her family had to be the one to consent and have the final say. 

Why it's still common today, I think, is because women today (in general), like women in the past, enjoy marrying men who take charge and become the leaders of the family unit.",eli5

29ga30,"Why do I feel much safer when I'm doing things that wouldn't really make me safe, e.g. being covered completely by a blanket or getting to the top of the stairs? ","On a very basic level, you *are* safer.

When you have a blanket, you're less exposed to the cold. Your body can relax a bit more since it's not solely responsible for your body heat anymore. 

When you're on the top of the stairs, you've reached the end of a physical exercise, so your body can start relaxing again. The fact that you know the top of the stairs is imminent alerts your body.

I think this is just a very basic rewards system that your body utilizes to suggest actions to your conscious mind. If your body or subconscious needs something, it'll try to urge you to do those things by making them seem more appealing.

Legs hurt? Sitting down makes you feel very comfortable. But if your legs didn't hurt, sitting down will give you a smaller feeling of comfort, because the need for sitting was not as high.  
Headache? If you close your eyes, your brain doesn't have to process all visual cues (which is a very intensive operation). The brain can relax a bit more, thus making you feel comfortable.

As for controversy, Scientology encourages people to convert their family and friends or leave them and never talk to them again. People who try to leave Scientology often have their lives destroyed, or are even tortured or killed [and this simple Google search may help you learn more](_URL_0_).

This is the exact same reason some DVDs skip in the middle of the movie. On a dual layer disk, data is stored in two layers. When the laser reaches the edge of the disk, it has to seek all the way back to the beginning to read the other layer.

","To answer this you must first understand why bread goes hard. Starch in bread crystallizes over time, and it's this crystallization that makes stale bread hard. The crystallization process actually _absorbs_ water as well, as water coordinates in the crystals. In fact, stale bread weighs more than fresh bread because water is absorbed from air into the bread, then locked up in starch crystals.

When you heat up bread, you are forcing water to escape, and you are also providing enough energy for the starch to break free from crystallization. This softens the bread.",eli5

When you consume large amounts of carbohydrates (sugar, starch, breads, stuff like that) it puts pressure on your pancreas to produce insulin. You also start to develop **insulin resistance**. You are still making insulin (other types of diabetes like type 1 cannot make insulin) but that insulin isn't as effective. Therefore you need to make more and more. This basically tires the pancreas out and you develop type 2 diabetes.

So how does that relate to poverty? Carbs are cheap. Cheaper and more processed foods are going to, on average, contain more carbs. If someone is struggling with money, they may choose to buy something that is higher carb but cheaper. Overtime this can cause the insulin resistance described above.",eli5

1nvnai,Why does drinking alcohol more often raise your tolerance? ,"The answer to this is the same reason that using other psychoactive drugs regularly gives you a tolerance, and I find this whole area quite fascinating actually!

To simplify this for the purposes of our discussion, drugs cause their effect in your brain by binding to receptors, which for this question we can imagine as 'buttons'. Alcohol is absorbed into your brain, binds to the 'buttons' that it 'presses' and this causes the intoxicating effect. If you were to ingest morphine, than it would bind to it's own 'buttons' in your brain and 'press' or activate those receptors. 

Your brain is always trying to normalize itself. If you are ingesting alcohol regularly, your brain wants to try to 'cancel out' this effect and get back to it's normal state. It does this by downregulating the receptors that alcohol binds to, or to simplify you could imagine this as the brain somewhat depressing the 'button' so that it's activation by alcohol does not have as great an effect. 

A similar thing happens with other drugs, again I'll use morphine as an example; if you ingest it regularly, your brain will downregulate the receptors that it binds to and so that the effect that morphine has is not as great. 

This is tolerance, and it is a lot more complicated than this but this is the basic idea. It takes more of the substance to get the same effect, as your brain is trying to get itself back to it's normal state of functioning. 

This downregulating is also what leads to withdrawal symptoms when you are addicted to a substance. The receptors that these drugs bind to are there because there are natural chemicals in your brain, neurotransmitters, that bind to these receptors. When these receptors are downregulated so that the drugs have less of an effect, it also means that these neurotransmitters have less of an effect when they naturally bind to the receptors. 

On top of this, your brain will decrease the amount of these neurotransmitters that are produced as you are ingesting a constant amount of a substance that binds to these receptors and that are activating them. 

When you stop constantly ingesting whatever the substance was that you were taking, you then have a situation on your hands where the receptors are not as active as they are supposed to be, and you have a decrease in the normal levels of the neurotransmitters that bind to these receptors. 

This causes the withdrawal symptoms, which vary widely from one drug to another. Nicotine withdrawal has less of a physical effect, and is more psychological. Alcohol withdrawal is very dangerous, and can even lead to seizures as the receptors that it binds to in the brain are important for regulating neural activity. Morphine/opiate withdrawal causes intense flu-like symptoms and psychological symptoms. 

Once exposure to the substance has ceased, than over time normal brain activity will resume and your receptors will no longer be downregulated. The tolerance goes down, and your brain functions normally again. However, as an anecdotal note I have heard from several former addicts that they never get back to having absolute 'zero tolerance' to their drug of choice, and there may be research into this that I am unaware of. 

To complicate this further, if you are interested, alcohol also has effects that aren't related to receptors in the brain as it also affects various electrical paths. 

If you want to read more into this, I'd recommend the Wiki pages to start with:

[Downregulation and upregulation](_URL_1_)

[Agonist, a chemical that binds to a receptor.](_URL_0_)

6cdnok,Why was the US in Vietnam for 20 years?,"After the US's World War II alliance with the Soviet Union dissolved, the Soviets resumed their push to establish communism in other countries around the world.  In Eastern Europe, the US had little choice but to watch this happen, as that was territory that had been occupied by the Soviets in the process of defeating Germany.  The Soviets soon built their own atomic bomb, and their new belligerence was symbolized by Khrushchev's famous threat: ""we will bury you.""  Meanwhile, the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with Communists in control of that huge landmass and population, and the cry ""who lost China?"" was much heard in American politics.

The end of colonialism in Southeast Asia meant the rise of Communists, among other political parties, in several countries.  But they were particularly strong and successful in Vietnam.  In hindsight, we've come to laugh at American officials who believed the ""domino theory""—that if Vietnam went communist, Thailand or even Japan or the Philippines might follow, threatening American military bases and interests in the region.  But this wasn't an entirely baseless fear at the time.

Alas, the Americans were forced to defend against Communism by working with a series of ineffective and corrupt South Vietnamese governments, and it eventually became clear that there was no clear way to win without risking Soviet or Chinese involvement, nor was there any way to gracefully withdraw.",eli5

42hxmw,"Why is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics often negatively associated with bacterial mutation? Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. Bacteria mutate and by doing so render the antibiotic useless. Wouldn't this mutation happen with or without the use of antibiotics?

 The concern that over use of antibiotics means more resistant bacteria seems to suggest that the bacteria can selectively mutate. That's not my understanding of evolution. I thought it was natural selection to promote high performing mutations, and mutations happen at random. In other words, living in the dark doesn't cause a a night vision mutation; those who by random chance have better night vision and therefore do better in the dark cause the mutation to spread via reproduction.

 It also suggests that thinning one strain of the bacteria makes it easier for another to flourish. I don't understand how that matters. Wouldn't there be fewer baseline bacteria to have the opportunity to mutate? 

Even if the antibiotic eliminated 100% of the bacteria in the world, leaving only strains which have resistance, those strains already existed so I don't understand why using antibiotics is considered to be somehow responsible for promoting resistant bacteria.","Imagine that your body is middle earth. You've got all these various bacteria in your body, humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, etc... Some are beneficial to you, others indifferent, and some even harmful.

Now lets say that the humans start a war of conquest, spreading across the land. Some of these humans are naturally immune to lightning, but this doesn't really help them in battle, so the war drags on inside your body.

You, realizing that something is wrong, go to the doctor. The doctor isn't 100% sure what's wrong, so he suggests lots of lightning strikes (antibiotics) be used. Rather that targeting the humans, he decides to target all the races (broad spectrum antibiotics). 

The lightning works, elves and humans and orcs die in droves. Except for those humans that happen to be immune. The immune humans continue to expand, one generation at a time, as the other destroyed races continue into decline, their numbers thinned too much to compete with the thriving humans.

Eventually, your body is covered in lightning proof humans, who are free to make you sick and to spread and conquer other world's, specifically your family, friends, and unfortunate coworkers. No matter how much lightning (antibiotics) you or anyone else uses, it has no effect.",eli5

1zmzjm,Why can't they make vaccines for all viruses (especially HIV) like they have for polio and HPV? ,"First we need to understand the nature of vaccines and HIV. 

A vaccine is a virus shell with the DNA inside removed or destroyed.  When introduced to the body, your immune system sees the virus, examines it, and produces weapons (called antibodies) that can grab onto the outside of the virus, preventing it from infecting any cells until it can be swallowed and digested by the amoeba-like white blood cells. 

HIV is a special kind of virus, because it selectively attacks white blood cells.  HIV *wants* to be eaten.  If the virus can get inside a white blood cell, it has completed its life cycle, it will soon override that white cell's DNA and start replicating itself. This is why we can't make a vaccine for it, because if we make a successful vaccine, all it will do is cause the actual infection to spread faster.",eli5

1qwba9,"Why would a country go into recession if they had no debt? There was a thread a while back in /r/askreddit that I read about this in. Apparently, if somewhere like the States or Canada paid off all debts, the country would begin to go into recession. Whats the cause and why?","A recession in the simplest terms means the economy is not producing goods and services as well as it had previously.

(For the US) 

In order to pay off the debt the US would have to either:

1. Drastically cut spending
2. Drastically increase taxes
3. Significantly Grow the economy.

Likely some combination of these three.  The problem though is that #3 is very much related to #1 and #2.  

If we cut spending significantly, than the people who would have been paid for some services won't, so they will close down businesses, and people will lose their jobs.  In the end, it will cause a recession, the severity of that recession dependent on how drastic the cuts are.  So we can't grow the economy by drastic cuts.

If we increase taxes significantly, than people and buisnesses won't have as much money on hand to pay for services and stuff from other people.  That means **those** buisnesses will fail, and will fire people, so less overall money will be spent.  In the end, it will cause a recession, the severity of that recession dependent on how drastic the tax increases are.  So we can't grow the economy by drastic tax increases.

You could do small cuts, and small tax increases, and probably won't harm the economy, and you might even help it.  But neither of those will reduce the debt within a particularly short time.

This is why many economists say the harm of the debt is insignificant compared to the harm of trying to make big changes to eliminate it.",eli5

37tb79,What are the effects on my body from eating a certain amount of food evenly spread out throughout the day VS eating that same amount of food in one sitting? Say I eat 2000 calories in 3 evenly spread out meals. How does my body process the food differently/how does it affect me differently in contrast to me eating 2000 calories in a single meal for the whole day?,"When you eat a ton of carbs, the blood sugar in your body spikes. This in turn causes insulin from your pancreas to be released. The insulin quickly normalises your blood sugar by converting it into glycogen to be stored in liver and fats in other parts of your body. What eventually happens is you've taken in 2000cal worth of sugars out of which your body has used up say about 200cal to function and saved up the rest 1800cal making you fat! Also making you hungry when your body uses up the 200cal and your blood sugar levels start to go down again.   

Now this is only for sugars. Proteins and fats are metabolised differently. If you eat 2000cal of pure protein, then your body will take a long time to break down and digest the proteins and you won't get any insulin spikes as your blood sugar levels won't spike. In fact your body will need to consume energy to break down the proteins and then its a fairly slow process for the proteins to get converted to glucose for your body to use for energy. Fats take even longer. So eating tons of proteins and fats will make you feel pretty full and tired as a lot of blood gets diverted to your gut to digest and absorb the food and then store them or convert them into glucose to be used for energy.  

Spreading out meals will reduce the blood sugar spikes which in turn reduce insuilin spikes which in turn reduce stress on your pancreas and risk of developing insulin resistance and diabetes. Though its not that simple because when your stomach gets filled up and stretches, hormones are released which tells your brain you're full and to stop eating/feeling hungry. Also other hormones slow down the emptying of the gut so the food contents are absorbed more slowly. The body is a complex mechanism! So really the best is to eat two to three times a day with the biggest meal in the breakfast when the body is less sensitive to insulin and then smaller meals for lunch and dinner.  

But as I mentioned above its more about what you eat than how much of it u eat. Sugars are what's really bad for you as that's what causes the blood glucose and insulin spikes. But also eating small amounts will reduce the glucose loads on your body as pretty much all food we eat has tons of carbs in them, especially in modern diets full of processed foods.",eli5
ka4em,Why do we get goosebumps when we hear/feel Styrofoam rubbing against more Styrofoam and nails scratching chalkboards? ,"As far as I know, people don't actually know why this happens yet! At first that seems surprising, but really there are all kinds of things we don't know yet about the human body. It took millions of years of evolution to get us here, and we've only been studying it for maybe a couple thousand - there are still a lot of puzzles left to solve.

That said, people have made a few [guesses](_URL_0_), mostly by trying to find other things that make these kinds of sounds - such as crying babies, or even some kinds of monkeys. But scientists haven't come to a good agreement on these guesses yet though. People haven't spent much time working on answers to this question yet, so these guesses may be way off the mark. And in fact, most of this work was only done very recently - in the last five to ten years or so.

Personally, my favorite explanation has to do with [our teeth](_URL_2_) (I've marked the important bits in bold):

 >  The answer came to me like a blinding flash. I was eating something at a picnic and I dropped it on the ground. I wiped it off and continued eating. (Oh, you do *SO* do it too!)
 >  
 >  As I was chewing, suddenly I heard SKKKKEEEEEERRRCH!!!!! ...as I bit down hard on a tiny stone. I think every single hair on my body stood on end, and my jaws froze instantly.
 > 
 >  THAT'S IT! Fingernails-on-blackboard: **It sounds exactly like the destruction of tooth enamel.** We're instinctively programmed to respond instantly. Of course! It's so sensible and obvious. Every little kid knows it. I remember many incidents from my own childhood. Why didn't we adults ever realize? The scraping of fingers on a blackboard is the classic, high-frequency violin-like waveform of hard dry surfaces moving with chaotic stick/slip motion. And that could very well be why our instincts are programmed to repond to it so strongly.
 > 
 >  **It's the sound of body damage; but it's a particular type of body damage for which there is no pain ...yet no healing.**
 >  
 >  We get no second chance with teeth. If we bite down on rocks, we wreck our enamel, and that could be why fingernails-on-blackboards makes everyone around us take drastic action to halt that noise. Why does nobody realize the origin of our response? We're too damned civilized, and we rarely have rocks in our food anymore. But whenever we bite down on something which is far harder than tooth enamel, our inborn programming instantly informs us about the problem in no uncertain terms. Sensible? Flesh can heal, but tooth surfaces do not.
 >  
 >  Skin is full of nerve endings, and pain normally teaches babies what not to do. The thick outer layer of our teeth lacks the pain sensors of other tissues. Won't animals need something besides pain to inform them that they're damaging themselves in a permanent way? Fingernails-on-blackboards could be entwined with evolution: Animals who respond strongly to that particular noise will guard their teeth carefully, and they won't ever bite down on rocks if they can possibly avoid it. **Animals who ignore that noise will die early from bad teeth.** We're the product of successful ancestors who CAN'T FREAKIN' STAND the loud internal sound of our own teeth scraping on rocks. And... hearing fingernails on chalkboard makes our teeth feel funny!

This guess hasn't really been properly tested out by scientists either though, but I think this makes a lot of sense - my teeth definitely tingle when I hear these sorts of sounds too. If we're lucky, we might know for sure in another five to ten years.

2g46qf,How come increased memory on an iphone is so expensive? A 16GB micro sd only cost $10 Why does it cost $100 more when buying an Iphone. Just take the same Micros sd and throw it in for just $10 more?,"Annoyed with the fanboy comments here so here's an actual answer:

The read/write speeds for one are lower on most MicroSD (for the purpose of this answer, we'll assume a standard £10/£20 card, rather than the 'extreme' cards that are upwards of £60-£100 for 64GB that have comparable speeds). 

Secondly, the quality of the actual flash storage is different. Many MicroSD cards wouldn't be able to handle the sheer amount of actual data writing involved in effectively running an OS. MicroSD cards are mainly used for occasional writing and more often, lots of reading. This means the storage isn't changed much, which gives the appearance of a great quality and long lasting product. Take it from experience, start writing GBs of data to a MicroSD card over and over and soon enough it'll fail. It's why desktop SSD's aren't just loads of MicroSD cards slotted together. 

The storage in the iPhone had to be of similar quality to that in a desktop SSD. It has to run a full mobile OS, frequently write data (pictures, music, videos, text messages etc.) and still perform at fast speeds with minimal to no loss in overall capacity over a long period of time. It has to have near zero failure as it'll cause the entire device to fail (think system file corruption). It's also in constant 24/7/365 use for several years. 

While it's well known the actual storage doesn't really cost that much as Apple buy so much of it, the fact is that they charge a premium for their devices, and they can also make bigger profit margins by charging more for more internal capacity. An extra £80 for doubling the capacity each time (although that's now changed slightly with the 6 and 6+). 

The final thing is this: by controlling the storage as internal only, Apple can control the overall experience further. A MicroSD card with a read/write speed of say 20/20Mbps versus 200/200Mbps would give very different results when copying data or playing back HD films. Apple can guarantee what will and won't work, the speeds of syncing data, and also what data can be copied to the device as it's not removable or readable as an actual storage device (for the most part when non-jail broken). 

Source: IT Engineer, Apple Certified Tech Co-ordination, former Apple employee, overall Apple/Tech nerd. 

TL;DR: The flash storage used in a MicroSD card is of a lower quality than that used in an iPhone (or other smartphones). Apple charge a premium because they can.",eli5

5fy6fo,"Why do some people convulse during a syncope? I have LQTS (Long QT Syndrome) and suffer from fainting episode frequently. People have told me that I shake whilst unconscious, but this was not a seizure. Why?","The movements you describe that accompany convulsive syncope are called *myoclonic jerks* or *myoclonus*. 

Studies suggest several locations in the brain are involved in myoclonus. One is in the brainstem, close to structures that are responsible for the startle response, an automatic reaction to an unexpected stimulus involving rapid muscle contraction. 

The specific mechanisms underlying myoclonus are not yet fully understood. Scientists believe that some types of stimulus-sensitive myoclonus may involve overexcitability of the parts of the brain that control movement. These parts are interconnected in a series of feedback loops called motor pathways. These pathways facilitate and modulate communication between the brain and muscles. Key elements of this communication are chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which carry messages from one nerve cell, or neuron, to another. Neurotransmitters are released by neurons and attach themselves to receptors on parts of neighboring cells. Some neurotransmitters may make the receiving cell more sensitive, while others tend to make the receiving cell less sensitive. Laboratory studies suggest that an imbalance between these chemicals may underlie myoclonus.",eli5

Therefore, with a higher amount of these chemicals going through your body, you will feel happier, more excited, and have fewer inhibitions- granting users the courage to talk and emote a *lot* more.

I'm cynical. I started out overly trusting and overly helpful. That was taken advantage of or rediculed. I gave people in my life who weren't strangers 100% leeway him terms of trusting them to not fuck me over. This clearly didn't work out for me.  I learned in politics , and corporate workplaces it's not how good you are at your job it's how good you are at being perceived as good at your job. I won't compromise my integrity but I will compromise my outlook on life. I now see things the way I think they are. When I hear the FCC head talking about net neutrality I assume he's playing the game with his angle and it probably involves a pretty good payoff. After my first real love cheated 10 years ago while maintaining astonishing capability to lie, the unreasonable part of my brain assumes my current girlfriend of 7 years is likely cheating if she gets a text at 6am or if she has to work an overnight at work. 
I don't trust people to be the person they try to be perceived as or do the things they say they'll do.

2dupvx,"Why can't I run fast in my dreams? Whenever I have a dream involving a scenario where I need to book it, I run as if I'm in water, or in moon gravity. Is it just me, or is there a reason for this?","It's a very common thing for people to experience in their dreams, and we don't really know why (dreams are not very well understood at all).

One possible explanation I've read before, however, is that your sense of how fast you are moving is dependent upon sensory input which your brain is not receiving (for example, seeing objects ""moving"" past your vision at an increased speed).

When you're in REM sleep (the periods of sleep associated with dreaming which also features the most frantic activity in the brain), parts of your brain responsible for receiving sensory information picks up on the chaotic subconscious ""noise"" going on elsewhere. The brain then has to interpret that information into something that makes sense to your conscious self.

So say your brain gets phony information that says your muscles are moving in a manner consistent with running, so that's what you experience in ""conscious"" reality of the dream. However you aren't getting other information associated with running (your breathing and heart rate hasn't increased, you don't feel the ground beneath you, your vision isn't seeing things moving relative to you at an increased rate etc, which is all consistent with being still or slow). So the brain translates this as ""I'm running, but also still"", which is what you experience.",eli5

This rationalization means the act isn't seen as gruesome - it's seen as neccessary and harmless. This coupled with the fact that lobsters are hard to empathise with (they're not cute, they don't have cute babies, they don't share any communication methods or behaviors with us, their lives are alien to us, they are 'bugs' etc) means that it's very hard to shift peoples' perceptions to include lobsters as part of a group of beings that are entitled to rights such as the right to life without suffering and so on.

The risk they were protecting was related to mortgages and while it wasn't insurance, it acted in similar ways to insurance.  

AIG got a tiny payment in exchange for a massive, but very low likelihood event (mortgages all across the US defaulting at once).  When that event occurred, they collapsed and needed to be bailed out (the government feared that because they were backstopping so much of the market that many other firms would fail, as well).",eli5

PS4 and Xbox One came out almost two years ago, yet games are still coming out for their predecessors. With Nintendo however, there's usually a clear line between the end of one console's life cycle and the beginning of the next. Why are Sony and Microsoft different?

I'm sure this causes lots of concern within the gaming community, particularly the infamous ""dumbing down"" of games to make sure it runs on older hardware. For the PC community, this causes fear of games being ported from the older consoles, not allowing for the most current and optimized versions.

I was reading the article on the front page about multiverse theory, and a comment was made how we can move through space at a maximum speed of light, but we can move space as fast as we want. I thought that was interesting, and would like more insight on the topic!","This is an oft used analogy.  Say we have an ant on a deflated balloon, and an evil maw of ant death it's crawling away from.  The ant can crawl at 1cm/hour (slow ants).  Given 2 hours, the ant could be 2cm farther from the maw. 

But wait!  If I blow up the balloon, the ant could be much farther than 2cm away in only a few moments, even though the ant never exceeds its maximum speed.

Light is the ant, the universe is the balloon.

EDIT: to make slightly more accurate and complex, as I mentioned to /u/wwarnout, the speed of light is a principle of the universe, not a principle of light itself.  So a better analogy would be that the balloon is sticky, and nothing on it, including the ant, can move faster than 1cm/hour due to the stickyness. 

EDIT2: as for warp drive (moving space to go faster) the basic idea of that is that the ant has a big vaccuum that sucks the balloon tighter in front of it, and pushes it wider behind it.  So even though it's travelling only at 1cm/hour, but the time the balloon returns ""to normal"" it seems to have gone further than it should have been able to.",eli5

Everyday they drill it into us that police authority comes from the people, and it is their duty to protect people and their rights. Why then, do police fight people when they are protesting for their rights? If people do not like their government, do they not have the right to overthrow it?","Because that isn't their job. The job of a police officer is to enforce the law, plain and simple. If the law says people can't mob city hall, then you will prevent people from mobbing city hall no matter what rights they are protesting for. And if you don't, you will be fired in short order. 

More importantly, I don't want police officers deciding who does and who doesn't have a valid reason to overthrow the government. Maybe a disenfranchised class is holding an unauthorized protest and disrupting traffic in a major city. You might want to help them because you agree with their goals. But what makes them different from a Klan rally? I don't want police to bend the rules on behalf of neo-nazis, therefore they shouldn't be allowed to do it on behalf of gays/black/other-oppressed-group either.",eli5

So, as you move faster and faster, you are essentially getting more massive at the same time. At normal speeds this tiny change in mass is irrelevant and can be ignored. But, as you approach the speed of light it starts becoming really important. When you get right up next to the speed of light you are so massive that going any faster would take more energy than exists in the entire universe.

As far as we know this is a hard limit. Only things that have zero mass like light can go the speed of light. We will never be able to change this.",eli5
2io0ai,"Why do most websites' search features suck so much? It seems like almost ALL websites' search features are just terrible, and as today's advice mallard suggests, it's better to just search ""_URL_0_ keyword keyword"" on Google. Why are the search functions so bad, especially considering that they are often run through Google? ","There are two main reasons. 

First is code re-use. Most websites are either built on a popular platform with a built-in search function (like WordPress), or implement a common search function downloaded from an internet repository (like GitHub). So most search functions suck because they mostly come from a short list of popular search engines/functions.

The second is that the concept of search is difficult. Language is extremely complicated for the human brain, let alone human programmed computers.

Google's algorithm is based mainly on the following assumptions:

1. The most helpful page will have been be accessed a lot.
2. The most helpful page will be referenced a lot by other sites.
3. The most helpful page will contain the words you searched, often and probably near the top of the page.
4. If lots of people search for a similar thing, click a link and don't return to click more, the first link was probably a good match.

As you can probably imagine, these rules work better with more activity. Like Reddit, good results bubble to the top.

When you're on some rinky-dink site that is implementing Google's algorithms, it's doing so with the handicap that the result set and activity base is much smaller. So it's less likely that lots of other people have searched for the exact thing you're looking for and trended towards a particular page.",eli5

40d896,"Why are owners of gun stores that preform background checks upset at Obamas executive order? **If you want to debate politics please move to r/politics now.  Thanks**

A couple things before you answer.  I am assuming business owners act entirely in their business interests, and they use logic based reasoning, and they do not respond to logical fallacies **including the slippery slope fallacy**.  It is entirely possible that my assumptions are wrong and if they are, please explain why.

**I am not looking for a gotcha answer**.  As a mid-high ranking business person, I am genuinely curious as to why rational owners are protesting something which apparently helps them.  I would like to know why it doesn't help/hurts them, or why they would oppose something that helps them.

**Again please refrain from debating politics and if you absolutely must, be respectful of all parties, including those who disagree with you**.  Thanks","His executive order really did nothing to expand, or affect back ground checks.  I've also not seen any gun store owners particularly complaining about what the orders actually did.  

Private citizens can still sell the occasional gun to someone else without having to go through a background check process, per the Fire Arms Owners Protection Act of 1986.  Meanwhile gun stores are still obligated to perform background checks, just as they were before.  

Any actual outrage over this coming from gun store owners is because they, like most private gun owners, don't like the idea of a President taking an executive action to attempt to restrict what they view as a constitutional right.  

When you boil down all of these executive orders they basically consist of ""Federal agencies must do the job that they've been supposed to be doing all along, and here's some more money to help them do it"".  

I saw a front-page CNN article that summed up the gun control town hall with the title ""Never has so much pomp been used to celebrate so little"". 

As practicale effective laws, the executive orders don't do much of anything.  For people concerned about the erosion of constitutional rights by unilateral political actions though, they are a very loud statement.  

Per your request, not trying to politicize my answer, but hopefully I've offered a decent answer without tinging it with too much of my personal opinion.",eli5

2dl7ig,How does water softening work and why do we need to do it? Always curious as to what this actually means and why we need to do it. ,"The previous two answers were correct, in that hard water contains minerals. 

To be more specific, hard water contains mineral salts - specifically calcium carbonate, and magnesium sulfate (amongst others). Groundwater can pick up these natural occuring mineral salts from soil and rocks. (Water sourced from wells will often be ""harder"" - than surface water). These salts dissolve and dissociate in water.

""Hard"" Water rich in Calcium and Magnesium ions (Ca^2+ and Mg^2+ ) can cause 2 major problems. 

1. These ions can form percipitates, often causing ""scaling"" on pipes, water heaters, coffee pots, etc. (it's the hard white residue, often called ""limescale"")

2. These ions inhibit the ability of soaps and other surfactants to properly ""lather"".

There are a few ways to remove the calcium/magnesium, but the most common is what's called an ""ion-exchange"" water softener.

The way these work is to basically substitue the calcium/magnesium ions in the water for a different ion - sodium (Na^+ ) Without getting too deep into the chemistry, a softener will usually contain an ""anionic"" (negatively charged) polymer (usually these are plastic beads). We add a sodium chloride (salt) soluton to the softener unit. The negatively charged polymer wil bind with the positively charged sodium ions. 

Next, we run the ""hard"" water over these Na^+ (polymer) beads. Since calcium and magnesium are more elctropositive (a ^2+ charge as opposed to a ^1+ charge for sodium), the calcium/magnesium will preferentially bind with the polymer and the sodium will replace these ions in the water.

Once the polymer has become saturated with calcium and magnesium, it can be ""recharged"" with sodium ions (this can be done by treatment with sodium in an alkaline solution). The waste calcium/magnesium (in solution) is disposed of (usually into a wastewater stream) and the process can be repeated. 

So the simple version is: *Hard water contains calcium and magnesium, water softeners replace these minerals with sodium.*

40mn09,"why is heroin completely addictive from one hit, while other drugs can take several hits, or never at all produce the same results? Just as the title suggests.

Why is heroin so immensely addictive, and in such an absolute and relentless manner? One hit of heroin can produce a lifetime addiction, while other very strong drugs such as ecstasy, acid, shrooms, never produce the same results, or even near them. Even counting the accumulative effects of other drugs, people seem to be hooked from the start with only one drug, heroin.

Why is that?","OK, simplified for ELI5:     
Heroin imitates a happiness hormone that our body normally produces in very small doses, endorphine.    
Now when you deliver a huge dose of that into your body (more than it could ever produce on its own), your body gets confused and thinks it has just messed up and produced too much: so it uses multiple mechanisms to reduce the amount of morphines and its effect in your bloodstream: Less endorphines get released while the receptors (the cellular structures that interact with morphines to produce the intended effect) get less responsive, so you need higher and higher doses to achieve the same effect.    
All this happens pretty fast and that's why Heroin /Morphines are so addictive. You are usually not addicted after the first hit, but it happens pretty fast so the best advice is to not even try it once.",eli5

The newest soapbox is a rally against the Common Core curriculum and all it represents, but I am so out of the loop on this matter I don't know how to discuss this. These are the same people who rally against vaccines, so I am cautious about most of their claims.","From what I can tell, the Common Core, rather than teaching students how to learn and critically analyze, it forces students to follow set procedures.  It grades based upon how well they conform to the procedure, as opposed to how well they understand the material, use of critical analysis, or ability to use the information in creative and novel ways.  (this criticism isn't about the common core itself, but rather the expected implementation of it based upon how schools currently implement similar programs)

However, it really is up to the local districts to decide how common core is implemented, so it is a case by case thing.

Honestly, the biggest issue I have with Common Core is that, from what I have seen and read, it has not had anywhere near the level of scientific backing that I would expect from any educational program, especially one being forced upon an entire country.  I want to see lots of test cases all over the country, years of data, and things of this nature.

Thank you.","It was proven long ago that humans physically can not generate enough energy to lift themselves. They are just too heavy. Birds have incredibly thin bones, which makes them extremely light. Otherwise they couldn't fly as easily as they do, if at all. It also has to do with size. Basically, the larger you are the harder it is to fly. So if you just scaled up a bird to the size of a human it probably also couldn't fly. It's just a fact of physics.

Fun fact: this is why dragons can't exist without magic; they are waaaaay too heavy to ever be able to generate enough lift force to actually fly.

Ultimately, the head ref has to make a judgement call every time a player goes down, and there is a very large gray area between ""definitely got fouled"" and ""definitely flopped"". When a player goes down, if both players were tugging and pulling, it's very hard to say who fouled who, and if the player that fell gave up too easily hoping to draw the foul or actually couldn't maintain his footing/balance.

I went to purchase some camera equipment online. I filled out the postage form and noted the P & H charge - fair enough, postage to Australia is expensive, I get that.

This has also occurred with audiobook and game downloads: items that would not need to incur any postage and handling fees.

A short while ago 99 cent iPhones apps cost $1.29 in Aus, even though the Australian dollar was stronger then the USD.

And lastly, a recent study by a news paper here actually concluded it would be cheaper to pay someone $24/hr and pay for the their flights to the US and back to buy an Adobe product, rather then buy it off the shelf here.

You haven't lived much, you haven't done much or experienced much, you've never been independent, and you're still learning the basics about almost everything. To add to that, you have all of the physical changes, and the whole ""figuring out who I am and where I fit into the world around me,"" thing. 

As you may have noticed, all of this is pretty stressful and sometimes worse and *everyone* has coping mechanisms for that. Those mechanisms can range from utterly benign, through the kind of judgmental closed-mindedness you're describing, to extremes of social aversion, self-harm, and violence. People like to feel like they have some kind of control, and ""hey just wait until you grow up a bit,"" is cold comfort. 

If you need an analogy, think of how anxious people get on airplanes, even though airplanes are incredibly safe.

49sgyf,Why game devs do fps cap on pc? Many of the PC games are capped at certain fps like 30 or 60. Why the devs do it? Wouldn't it be more logical just to let the customer's PC to deicide? ,"In many cases, game developers (especially ones targetting consoles first and foremost) lock certain parts of game logic to the FPS, so if you uncap the FPS and have, say, 120 FPS when developers developed with 60, the physics simulation would run twice as fast.

This may seem asinine; why would you ever do that? Well, there's a reason. There are three ways to deal with timesteps for your logic:

1. Locked FPS — this is the simplest solution. Everything runs at a stable, controlled timestep.

2. Vary by the difference in time, or delta time — this seems nice at first, but you run into issues when you have very high FPS or very low FPS and thus very small or very big delta times. There, floating point inaccuracies start to bite you in the ass. It's also less stable, and you can't easily control the timestep, so it makes debugging harder.

3. Lock your logic in a fixed timestep and interpolate values for your renderer — this is the ""best"" solutions, so to say. The game runs at a variable FPS, but the simulation will run at a nice fixed timestep. This is a lot harder to implement, however, than the other two.",eli5

I mean, isn't it possible for another planet to orbit the sun perpendicular to us? Why does this generally not happen? ","It's possible for a planet to orbit in a perpendicular path, and in fact some comets do that.

The thing is, as far as we know all the planets in the Solar System formed together out of the same original dust cloud. It turns out that when you have a spinning cloud of dust, angular momentum keeps the dust from collapsing inwards along the plane of rotation, but gravity pulls the dust together along the axis of rotation, and the dust particles' mutual electromagnetic interactions slow them down in their fall, so that the cloud tends to become a disk over time. Later, when planets collapse out of the dust, they are arranged roughly in that same plane.",eli5

What exactly are they trying to do, and is it true that you shouldn't drive on these roads? ","Highway Engineer here:

It's a cheap road-resurfacing treatment. Usually only used in rural areas, and sometimes called ""chip seal"" or ""oil and stone"". The process involves spreading a thin layer of emulsion over the existing road surface, and covering that with a medium to fine graded gravel. The gravel (chips in your example) adhere to the oil and the whole thing is rolled out with a drum roller to compact it.

The problem with this is not all the gravel sticks to the oil at first, so if you drive on it when its been recently laid down, you're going to get a lot of gravel pinging up at your car, you'll hear it, and possibly get a few dings on your car. Eventually, they will send a street sweeper to clean up the rest, but they do rely on traffic to compact it a little further in the meantime.

2y6h2p,"Why are large denomination currencies still in circulation? Hard as I try, I can't find any reason for the existence and use of large denomination currencies (in the example of the US, anything over $50) except for some illegal purpose - tax evasion, money laundering, financing an illegal activity, etc.

Before people go ballistic I would like to add that this issue should, at least in my opinion, be judged separately from whether the illegal activity financed with large denomination currencies should indeed be itself illegal; it's a topic for another conversation, but I would argue that the problem of buying illegal drugs should be solved by legalizing drugs, the problem of excessive taxation should be solved by reducing taxes, etc - in short, a desired activity which is considered illegal should be legalized, not just made unenforceable.

And to preempt another line of argument - while not everybody has credit cards, debit cards, cash cards and other cash substitutes, most people probably do. And the needs of those who are too poor to afford any of these, can be addressed other than by allowing, for example, terrorist organizations to finance their operation in cash held in large denomination currencies. In addition, anybody who can afford to buy - in cash - something worth more than, say, $1,000 (that is, using 20 $50 bills), probably wants to do it not because he is too poor to afford a credit card, but because he probably can't explain his source of funds...

And yet, governments continue to print large denomination currencies (the number of $100 bills printed in the US [seems to increase every year](_URL_0_)). So aside from whether you consider a cashless society a desirable situation, what interest do governments have in doing that?

9z9p91,Why isn’t mould that grows on cheese or bread edible? ,"So I dont think anyone answered the question, why isnt it edible, just that you can cut it off. But why do you have to cut it off?

To eat their food, mold secretes digestive enzymes(chemicals that take big molecules like carbs and break then down into simple molecules, like glucose). Then they absorb these small molecules into their body. They also can secrete other chemicals that harm other organisms (this is where some antibiotics come from)

If we eat these molds, they can potentially continue to secrete these enzymes and defense chemicals and harm our cells. These can hurt the good bacteria in our stomach and our own cells. 

What about our stomach acid? Won't it kill the mold? Possibly, but as an example, bread mold can live at a pH of 2.2, and our stomach ranges from 1.5-3.3. 

And there is also a risk to people who have compromised immune systems, so their immune system wont be able to kill off any mold if it actually survives to stomach and starts going into our body. 

Will you get sick if you accidentally consume a little bit of mold? Probabaly not. But its just an increased chance that you will get sick. Just like you may get sick if you drink milk starting to sour, or chicken that is a little under done. But you should still try to avoid those situations since they increase your risk of getting sick.",eli5

6kf0vq,how do you calculate the damage caused by an asteroid hitting earth? How much damage would be caused by an asteroid 12-27m diameter travelling at 7.5km/s if it hit earth? Thanks! ,"There are five main factors that influence how much damage an asteroid will do if it hits the Earth:

1) Its mass. This is obvious - the more mass the asteroid has, the more oomph it is going to hit with.

2) Its velocity. Again, kind of obvious - an asteroid hitting at 30 km/s will hit with four times as much energy than one hitting at 15 km/s.

3) Its density. The denser an asteroid is (for the same mass), the better it is at penetrating the atmosphere - and thus the more of its energy it retains as it hits.

4) The impact angle - the shallower the angle is, the more atmosphere the asteroid has to go through and the more it is slowed down before impact.

5) What it hits. Depending on the material that is hit, there may be secondary damaging effects - for example, an asteroid hitting the ocean will cause a tsunami.

For your example... let's assume a 20 m diameter asteroid made of iron, with a density of 8000 kg/m^3. Let's also assume it comes in at a 45 degree angle, and hits sedimentary ground.

The asteroid will strike the ground at 6.74 km/s, with an energy of 180 kilotons TNT equivalent. It opens up a crater with a diameter of 577 meters and a depth of 177 meters.

At five kilometers from the impact point, the seismic shock (which arrives about one second after impact) will have a magnitude of 4.1 and a Mercalli intensity of IV to V - dishes and windows might break, and you will definitely feel it. The airblast will arrive 15 seconds after the impact, with a peak overpressure of 0.105 bar and maximum windspeed of 23.7 m/s (a severe gale, level 9 on the Beaufort scale), enough to shatter windows.

If you are just 1 km away, the airblast, with an overpressure of 2.07 bar, will be sufficient to cause multistory wall-bearing buildings and highway bridges to collapse - almost no residential structures will remain standing.

I got these effects from the [Earth Impact Effects Program](_URL_0_) - you can enter some data yourself, see what happens with different asteroid sizes, densities and velocities.",eli5

4970mc,Why do VHS tapes degrade the more you play them? ,"In two ways.

First, VHS tapes are printed on a thin and very flexible plastic film. As you play them, that film is wound through and around a number of handling wheels and trolleys. This places stress on the plastic, stretching it over time, and any dirt or grit in your machine amplifies these little stresses. Eventually the film is pulled so much that the magnetically encoded information on it no longer reads as well.

Second, the magnetic coating itself degrades over time. Your television and VHS machine both have electrical fields that can influence magnetic writing if things get too close to them. And simple aging of the tape will help this along.

What about the advertisers who aren't showed as often due to this?","Modern ad buying is more complicated than views, because they rely on CPA (cost per acquisition). In other words, we say how much we want to pay to get someone to do a thing. Then our ad is shown X number of times based on how much we have to spend.

**Marty is selling lemonade.** Marty has $10 to try and get people to buy his lemonade. He says he'll pay up to **$2 per kid** to buy his lemonade.

**Sarah is selling hot dogs.** Sarah has $20 to try and get people to buy her hot dogs. She says she'll pay up to **$3 per kid** to buy a hot dog.

**Nancy is selling houses.** She has $8000 to try and get people to buy her houses. She says she'll pay up to **$20 per kid** to convince their parents to buy a house.

Johnny sells time on his megaphone. He looks at Nancy and starts with her $20 per kid, and yells at people until the time it costs him hits $20. He then spends Nancy's $8000 @ $20 per kid, then spends Sarah's $3 per kid, then finally Marty's $2 per kid.

**Moral of the story:** Different people are willing to spend different amounts to get their message heard. The brands you are seeing are willing to spend a lot (relatively speaking) to reach you. They are crowding out the other people who also want to talk to you. That is why you are seeing so many of the same ads.

Dust isade of various small particles. Like fibers from clothing or plants, pollen aggregates, etc. And there's always some dust in the air as can be seen when a ray of light shining through a room is observed from the side.

Since dust particles are very light they can ride on air currents but since their density is greater than air they will always settle on surfaces given enough time. Since abandoned houses usually have large undisturbed volumes of air all that dust will slowly settle on surfaces.

5qlqwm,what is the Canadian Healthcare program and why won't it work for the U.S? ,"The Canadian healthcare system is administered through the government. Each province (kinda like a state, but bigger) funds their own program, while the nation sets some guidelines.

What this means is that they don't pay for healthcare like we do here. Instead, they pay taxes, and then when they go to say, the hospital, the government pays all/most of it. The government also takes care of negotiating drug costs etc with companies.

What that means is you don't need private insurance, like you would here (unless you're exceptionally rich). However, the public system doesn't cover everything. For example, dental/eye care works more like it does in the U.S. They do have private insurance, but it's more supplemental. The national healthcare is more basic, while private lets you get some perks that would cost extra.

This also means you don't need to worry about being turned down if you can't afford treatment. No one is turned away, and the taxes you pay are proportional to income

 > why won't it work for the U.S?

That isn't really an easy question to answer. There's no real proof that it won't- however, people are scared to try, because they think that government being in healthcare will make it very inefficient, or give people bad care. 

It's never been tried, so a lot of it is speculation tied to political beliefs on the role of the government. People who think the government should be small and leave stuff like this to the free market, are going to oppose national health care. (and vice versa).

It's worth mentioning that Canada (as well as many european countries), tend to pay less for the same level of care that we do in the U.S. That doesn't mean it would for sure work- but it's very suggestive that it might, besides just actually trying it to see.

While it is much cheaper, there are potential downsides. Canada is known for having relatively long waiting periods to get procedures done, and they tend not to have as many high end options as the US- in the US, there tends to be better specialized options, if you can afford it. A lot of people also argue that we essentially end up subsidizing R & D costs for the world, and that if we switched, less drugs would be made, but it's hard to prove if that is true or not.

You might find this helpful, for more detail (but easy to read!):

Or previous ELI5s:
_URL_0_

edit2:
I should also mention, that the reason it's cheaper, is that the government is a *very* big customer. That means they have a lot of bargaining power. The bigger you are, the cheaper you can get stuff (this works for insurance companies as well, they like being as big as possible for the same reason). So they can negotiate much lower prices with medical suppliers, which make much less money than they do in the U.S. The government also doesn't have to make a profit like a private insurance company, which saves as well. (Although insurance profits are relatively low in the US- it's a very competitive field. Most of the money ""wasted"" goes to providers, the people who make medical equipment or service, like doctors)",eli5

When you stub your toe, thousands to millions of cells receive a stimulus (a blunt force against your bone, some cells bursting open from the force, etc) and transmit that information up your body through a series of channels up your limbs, through your spine, and into your skull, ending at your brain. The delay from the initial impact to the feeling of pain has to do with the time it takes for that message to relay, where the feeling of pain starts when the message first gets there. Your brain also uses the sheer volume of messages to determine how strong a stimulus is, so as the message arrives from all the neurons involved (including those sending the message that it still hurts) the pain gets more intense and it takes longer for some nerves to get their message to the brain than others, based on distance and path traveled.",eli5

yif8u,"What is Social Security, how does it work in the U.S, and why is it deemed unsustainable? ","Social Security was instituted during the Great Depression to do two things.  First, it was to give retired people who had lost everything in the crash income to survive.  Second, it was in incentive to get many old people to retire to open jobs up for unemployed youth.  So they come up with a plan to take a little bit out of everyone's paycheck, and give it to retirees so they can survive.

Fast forward 20 years and we get the Baby Boom.  Now with a good economy and a TON of workers Social Security is making more money than they're paying out.  So we decide to invest it like any other financially savvy person.  In a rare case of actually getting out AHEAD of the problem, we realized we're going to need this money when all these Baby Boomers RETIRE.  Well what do we invest it in?  Has to be low risk!  Low risk = US Government Debt.

Fast forward to present day, the Boomers are starting to reach Social Security age and the US Government owes Social Security an IMPERIAL SHITLOAD of money it doesn't have.  So Social Security will be needing this money over the coming decades and the federal government is broke.

5gnjz4,Why/How does my back know there's a cold front coming?,"Changes in weather are quite often preceded by changes in barometric pressure- that is, the pressure of the air around you. As air pressure goes up or down, your body's internal cavities will lag behind these changes in pressure.

Certain areas of the body can be sensitive to pressure differences- joints, mainly, which have this stuff in them called ""synovial fluid"", which helps lubricate and cushion your joints- as an aside, that's the stuff that causes a cracking sound when your joints pull apart, it's bubbles forming and collapsing in your synovial fluid.

When the pressure outside is different than inside, it can cause pain in joints that have been damaged and/or have had metal or other materials inserted. What you're experiencing is probably sensitive tissues that are reacting to pressure changes.

For what it's worth, I have a similar experience with my wrist post-surgery, although in my case no metal was added.",eli5

1yzp9p,"How come ""Black Power"" is seen as r Inspiring, and pro-equality/freedom etc. however ""White Power"" is seen as racist? We were studying African American Civil-Rights in history, this thought poped into my head.","Black people have been oppressed, and have been told to be ashamed of who they are, and that they were inferior, equivalent to animals or property.  Supporting Black pride or black power is about saying that there is no need to be ashamed or feel like you are inferior even though society would lead you to believe you are.

White people (as a general vague group) haven't been broadly oppressed in the same way, they have not been near universally considered inferior subspecies who are better used as property then treated as human beings.  On the other hand they've been the groups that have supported and put in place these ideas towards others.

So ""White Power"" is treated as ""supporting oppressing non-whites"" because people who said ""white power"" in the past **actually did that a lot**.  Saying ""Black Power"" is treated as ""overcoming oppression"" because that oppression actually existed/exists.  If Black people had broadly treated any non-blacks as subhumans and used the law to make them property, then ""Black Power"" would be seen as supporting that.",eli5

26j9rd,Why can Google search the internet faster than my OS can search my harddrive? What are the fundamental differences between the searching processes/algorithms? And why is the standard OS's local file search so slow in comparison?,"Google has a *lot* of things going on that give it an advantage. If you think of the internet (or your computer) like a library, these are some of the differences:

* **More librarians** If I went to the library and asked for all the books by, or about, J.R.R.Tolkein, the librarian could probably do that somewhat quickly, with a computer and the Dewey Decimal system. But Google is like a library with 100 librarians just for me, who each rush off to find one book and come back. Your computer probably has one librarian available. Maybe 2.

* **A better index**: Your index on your computer is optimized for frequent reads and writes, because you often add files and change them, and you'd want quick access to these new things. (""I *just* saved that meme image, where is it??"") Google's index (roughly speaking) is optimized for even faster reads by changing very infrequently. Other servers are busy processing changes from the crawlers, but Google Search servers *only* process searches. In your computer's library, every time you add a new file, a librarian has to add a new book to the shelf, and sometimes that means making room by shuffling other books around. The work of shuffling these books around can take away librarian time from what you want: getting the books you asked for. In a way, Google is constantly building an *entirely new copy of that section of the library*, to eventually swap it out, Indiana Jones style. That means you can't find the most recent books that exist, until the next section swap. But that it also means no one adding/moving books gets in the way of librarians actually *finding you books*, which you want.

* **Better librarians** Your index on your computer is probably a file on your harddrive. Google's information is probably in memory. Memory is already 100x or more faster than hard drive lookups. Google's is an army of specialized computers that present itself as one cohesive library. It's got one whole library dedicated to searches that start with ""aaa"" through ""aardvark  monocle"". Another one for ""aardvark monocles"" through ""AT-AT scenes original vs remastered"", etc. And because each of the librarians there specialize, they've probably got some of the answer memorized for you already, and don't need to look it up like your computer librarian. 

* **Better hardware**. Google's librarians can also run faster and carry more books than your computers' librarians. Google built them rocket powered roller skates, and thinks about library design so much that they cut down on average distance from help desk to book. Also, your librarians are distracted doing things like telling you what your friend just said on Skype, or handing you the latest version of _URL_0_",eli5

Really confused right now...","It's important to recognize that in aqueous solutions, metal atoms tend to form their respective cations.

Zinc has electron configuration of [Ar] 3d10 4s2 and will lose its outermost two valence electrons when in water and form Zn2+.

Copper has electron configuration [Ar] 3d10 4s1

Therefore for copper to displace zinc it would require copper to lose another electron and break up the 3d sub-shell.

o1uuv,"why I don't dissipate into the air, but rather hold my form. So this has been a mind-boggling topic for pretty much my whole life. I have taken basic physics and understand the build of the universe to a degree (Protons, neutrons, electrons and what not), but I still don't understand **WHY**... As in what says ""This right here is where an object shall stop."" Gasses can obviously disperse and move from their original shape but why don't I? Why is it that when I come into contact with an object I don't leave part of myself or pick up a part of the object? I don't know if I have aptly described the topic which I wish to understand, but I guess taking it to its core I would have to ask, what force creates the boundary which separates ""my"" particles from any other object's particles and why does that happen?","Imagine you build two lego houses. You can then press the (presumably smooth, unless you're rubbish at lego) sides together, but they won't stick. The ways that lego pieces interact have already been used up, so they don't care about the pieces of the new house. Your question here is a little analogous to 'how do the lego pieces know not to stick to the second house, but to stick to each other within the same house?'.

Or what about laying one woolen blanket on top of another, then lifting it up again. A blanket is a tangle of fabric strands, but these stands are mixed up in such a way that when you put another blanket nearby they don't tangle up with that one as well. When you lift the blanket up again, it simply lifts off the other blanket, because the strands aren't twisted in such a way that they interact. This time, your question translates to something like 'how do the blankets know that there are two of them, rather than just making one big blanket when you put them together?'.

Both of these cases are somewhat analogous to things happening on the quantum scale. For the first one, individual atoms or molecules bond with one another in favourable ways, after which they may be much less likely to interact with further molecules. For the second one, large scale quantum structures can behave quite like blankets (as an example, it's not just blankets) in that they don't interact with other things despite holding themselves together. 

This is just two handy wavy analogies, but hopefully it gives an idea of how things work on a more intuitive macroscale level.",eli5

What is the science behind this?","Each wave in a microwave (the radiation) jiggles water molecules - and it'll jiggle the first one(s) that it comes in contact with. As a result, *microwaves (the tools) heat from the outside in.*

If you're using the right kind of bowl, that extra heat won't disperse very much outward, to the bowl itself - so it'll either stay where it is, or it'll start to transfer inward and heat up the soup nearer the middle, too.

So:

* Using a better bowl will make the bowl not heat up as much;

* Using a lower power setting will give the heat more time to transfer to the center; and/or

* stirring will also spread the heat around quicker and better.",eli5

As others have mentioned there are likely tens of thousands of applications your university has to process. But it's not even clear how they should be processed, because who the university admits and in what quantity is an issue that has to be discussed among dozens of decision-makers who also have numerous other jobs they must also attend to. They have a target deadline by which they announce admissions decisions, and as long as they're on schedule for that they're not going to push to go ahead of schedule when there are likely numerous other projects that have much closer deadlines.

And when they do process applications and scores, there are likely privacy laws and rules that come into effect so only certain people can view the documents, they can only be stored on encrypted computers, etc that increase the complexity of receiving and viewing the apps.

Is it efficient? No. Is it amazing what a university staff can do given how many things have to go right for the school to run smoothly? In my modest opinion, absolutely.",eli5

1oanig,"why is lobbying legal at all? As i understand it, lobbying is a big part of politics in many countries. How is this not been banned yet? Why arnt people caring a out theese big corps. As their money seems to be worth more to politicians than regular folk.","1) There's a lot of lobbying that is legitimately good and helpful to the political process.  Remember, lobbying includes any kind of effort to influence a politician.  Just writing an email to a senator counts.  There's also lobbying for the purpose of making sure an official is aware of the impact of a bill (proposed law).  For example, pretend a law is proposed that changes the kind of tools doctors can use.  A politician is not a medical professional, so he may not fully comprehend the impact of the bill.  As a result, someone with knowledge in that area may be needed to explain why doctors feel strongly about the bill.  

2) As long as anybody has the right to donate to a political campaign, it's really hard to tell which funds were received by unfair means.  It's not like lobbyists just say ""Here's a check for $100,000 if you vote yes on the bill.""  It's more like lobbying groups making donations to candidates that they like and encouraging others to do the same after the politician does something they like.  That's not really any different than when a regular citizen says, ""I support gay marriage.  Candidate X voted in favor of the gay marriage law.  I'll donate to his campaign so a good guy like him can stay in office.""  In other words, considering that campaign donations exist in the first place, it's not easy to tell whose donations were used to unfairly influence a politician and whose donations were merely rewards for supporting views that some voters agree with.

3) The people who determine what's legal are the ones who benefit from lobbyists and often become lobbyists after serving in office.  This means that it's in their interest to not go overboard with restrictions.",eli5

As part of the process, chemicals called histamines are released by cells into the blood, and allergy pills generally interfere with them to knock down the degree of inflammation.

Why, specific people develop stronger responses to certain allergens isn't fully understood. People tend to get allergies through exposure to the allergen and can be treated by tiny exposures to same (so the body learns to control it's response). It's widely believed that allergic responses are worse among those people who have the least exposure to potential allergens and germs in their environment.",eli5

So you have ice floating in a liquid in a glass. Ice has a low coefficient of friction, meaning it's slippery. So when you turn the glass, there is very little rotational force along the interface between the ice/liquid and the glass. So given this lack of force, the ice will tend to stay where it is.",eli5

I thought debt was a bad thing, why doesn't every country fight against it as much as the government can?","Debt comes from different sources besides bonds, but I understand those best. Springfield ohio wants to do whats best for the people that live there. So they decide to build a hospital and upgrade the roads. This will create some permanent jobs(increasing tax revenue) save some lives and possibly attract people to move there instead of other places without a hospital. But they dont have the millions of dollars to build this now, and of the city waits to build a hospital, people with the means to move will leave to greener pastures. So they issue municipal bonds that pay a small interest rate. In the long run the city and its residents are better off. The bond buyers make some money off the interest. At a bigger level a state will have bonds for bigger projects like bridges and the federal level has t bills(treasury bills) the end result being that the debt amount is unimportant as long as the city takes in more tax money as a result.

25nswi,why does our eyesight weaken? Overtime or otherwise,"A good understanding of vision loss requires a brief foray into the basic structure of the eye. Although it might be considered a clich¿, it is still useful to compare the eye to a video camera. Thus, as light enters the eye--or the camera--it travels through four main structures. By understanding this basic eye anatomy we can begin to understand the ways in which the light signal can be degraded or distorted, resulting in poor vision.

The entry point for light is the cornea, the transparent tissue in the very front of the eye that functions as the window through which all light has to pass on its way to forming a visual perception. Next, the light signal encounters the lens, which focuses it finely on the third structure of the eye: the retina. The retina is analogous to the film in the back of the camera. It is on the retina that the light is converted into a neural signal that is ultimately interpreted by the brain as an image. Finally, the optic nerve, which carries these signals to the brain, functions like a cable that connects the video camera to the television screen. The deterioration of our vision with age is invariably the result of a problem with one of these four structures.

The integrity of the corneal surface is very important for the reception of a clear image. If its surface is not smooth and intact the image will suffer, much like the image from a scratched camera. A very thin layer of tears coats the surface of the cornea. This tear surface, produced by various cells, some of which line the inner surface of the eyelid, is vital to maintaining the cornea¿s smooth surface and precise optical characteristics. Any condition that disrupts this tear film can lead to a breakdown of the cornea¿s surface and, thus, degradation of the image.With age, this smooth surface can be damaged by conditions such as blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelids. If the inflammation is severe enough, then the cells that produce the tears can be damaged, with an attendant impact on the tears coating the cornea. In this situation an individual may experience symptoms such as the sensation of a ""film"" over the eye, which is usually transient and relieved with blinking. More serious symptoms can also occur, such as blurry vision, which is due to evaporation of the tears and drying out of the corneal surface. This condition can become chronic and is known as dry eyes. Treatment options for blepharitis and dry eyes depend on the cause of the inflammation of the lid surface but can include warm compresses, artificial tears, oral antibiotics and even topical immunosuppressive agents to decrease the inflammatory response leading to the degraded tears.

The lens is also subject to the aging process, and the resulting conditions--cataracts and presbyopia--will eventually affect just about everyone. When we are born our lenses are crystal clear, meaning that the image entering the eye is not degraded by any opacity. They are also very pliable, meaning that the lens can change its shape to help focus images that are very far away as well as very close. Unfortunately, as we grow older two things happen to the lens: it clouds up and it becomes less pliable. The clouding of the lens--or cataract--forces an image to travel through a distorted medium, resulting in diminished vision. Similarly, when the lens loses its pliability it also loses its ability to focus over a wide range of distances. A hardened lens becomes more fixed on distant objects and cannot focus as well on nearby objects or vice versa. This hardening often occurs in middle age, when people notice the need to hold the newspaper farther away in order to read the print, and is known as presbyopia from the Greek wordspresbus, meaning old man, and opia,meaning eye

.Fortunately, there are treatments for both these conditions. A lens that has developed a cataract can be removed surgically and replaced by an artificial one. The implanted lens is clear and allows the image to pass through the eye nondegraded. As for presbyopia, the solution is even simpler--reading glasses or bifocals.Finally, the retina and the optic nerve work in tandem and deterioration in either can lead to serious, even blinding, conditions. The retina is an extremely complex tissue that converts the light image entering the eye into a neural signal. This signal is then transmitted to the brain by extensions of the ganglion cells. It is the extensions of these cells that form the optic nerve so, in a sense, the optic nerve is an extension of the retina.

 Numerous studies have shown that, in the absence of disease, there is no significant age-related deterioration in visual capacity of the retina or optic nerve. Unfortunately, age-related diseases of the retina and optic nerve are not entirely rare. Macular degeneration (loss of central retinal function) and glaucoma (damage to the optic nerve due to increased intraocular pressure) lead the list. Early detection of these diseases can often prevent or minimize the extent of vision loss, particularly as new and improved therapies become available.

In summary, as our population ages, society is not fated to having millions of people with ""dim"" eyes. Rather, with proper proactive ophthalmic care and an emphasis on the development of new therapies for blinding diseases we can continue to make ""great vision"" a reality for those past the first blush of youth.",eli5

Now go do the math to figure out the power and angle you need to throw it with to hit the target

When you threw the ball your brain ran all the numbers, set the muscles, and did the action. It did all the calculations it just didn't return a number for you to use

Doing the math by hand is emulating what the computer is trying to do. It's creating a numerical answer to feed into an unknown system. Your brain knows what system it's connected to so it skips spitting out the numbers and just issues the orders. Your brain doesn't use it's computational powers for written arithmetic, it's not specialized in that. It can give you pretty good answers to differential equation problems very quickly because that's what you encounter daily without realizing it",eli5

6hmpsa,Why do we blush when we are nervous? ,"According to Josh Clark of HowStuffWorks:

 > Blushing from embarrassment is governed by the same system that activates your fight-or-flight response: the sympathetic nervous system. This system is involuntary, meaning you don't actually have to think to carry out the processes. In contrast, moving your arm is a voluntary action; You have to think about it, no matter how fleeting the thought is. This is good, because if moving your arm was involuntary, people would end up buying a lot of stuff they don't want at auctions.

 > When you're embarrassed, your body releases adrenaline. This hormone acts as a natural stimulant and has an array of effects on your body that are all part of the fight-or-flight response. Adrenaline speeds up your breathing and heart rate to prepare you to run from danger. It causes your pupils to grow bigger to allow you to take in as much visual information as possible. It slows down your digestive process so that the energy can be redirected to your muscles. All of these effects account for the jolt you feel when you find yourself embarrassed.

 > Adrenaline also causes your blood vessels to dilate (called vasodilation), in order to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery. This is the case with blushing. The veins in your face respond to a signal from the chemical transmitter adenylyl cyclase, which tells the veins to allow the adrenaline to do its magic. As a result, the veins in your face dilate, allowing more blood to flow through them than usual, creating the reddened appearance that tells others you're embarrassed. In other words, adrenaline causes more local blood flow in your cheeks.",eli5

7hwyeu,Negative effects on children from a gluten and dairy free diet? Are there any positives? Is there such a thing as a leaky gut?,"No diet is harmful so long as you get all the nutrients you need. If, starting from a balanced diet, you reduce your dairy intake, you'll have to compensate for the reduced intake of macronutrients like carbs, fats and proteins, and micronutrients like calcium and vitamins B2 and B12. You'll also have to get some of your fluids from elsewhere. None of these nutrients are particularly hard to replace though.

The same goes for gluten, which itself isn't a nutrient that your body specifically needs. It is found of course in many baked goods and other products made with grains like wheat, barley, rye or oat. So with gluten you're cutting out a more diverse selection of foods and its harder to give a specific answer. But there are lots of gluten-free alternatives these days to replace those foods with, and afaik there isn't any specific food with gluten in it that contains nutrients that can't be found anywhere else. 

As for positives, people who are lactose intolerant will obviously benefit from cutting down on dairy. Those who have celiac disease need to follow a strict gluten-free diet because gluten damages their gut. There is also evidence for a condition known as ""non-celiac gluten sensitivity"". People who have this get symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome when they consume gluten, but to them gluten isn't nearly as harmful as to people who have celiac disease, and there is no medical need to abstain from gluten entirely. Also the diagnosis isn't very clear because it's based purely on symptoms correlating with gluten intake, and some people may be misdiagnosed who actually have a wheat allergy or sensitivity to other things in grains. And there also seems to be a bit of a ""fad-component"" to it with lots of people self-diagnosing a gluten-sensitivity based on tenuous evidence, because it's something they've heard about that can explain a variety of symptoms.

There appears to be no good evidence for the condition known as ""leaky gut syndrome"".",eli5

6e3cn3,how come the top of muffins always taste the best compared to the rest of the muffin? ,"Mostly due to the Malliard reaction.  That is a fairly complex chemical reaction between amino acids and sugars in cooked food.  

It is often confused with caramelization, which people are more familiar with.  That involves sugars too, and often looks similar (browning).

The effects of carimelization on flavor are better known so I will focus less on that.

Both of those processes result in new compounds with distinctive flavors of their own.  The top of the muffin is exposed to direct heat and experiences more of those changes.

Think of a nice seared steak with a light crust starting to form.  Now imagine that same steak if boiled.  The difference is that in the seared steak the Malliard reaction has occurred.  The flavors produced are pretty heavily 'umami'.

Umami is the flavor that we in the west rather poorly describe as 'savory'.  That could be, and likely has been', a topic all its own.

95nw86,"Front wheel drive, Rear wheel drive, All wheel drive: How do these impact the way a car moves, and why would one be more preferred than the others?","Rear wheel drive is better for performance, since the force of quick acceleration pushes weight toward the rear tires to improve grip, it's easier to push than pull, and because the tires doing the propelling aren't the ones doing the turning. However, at slow speeds, rear wheels have less traction since weight is typically toward the front (engines weigh a lot). So front wheel provides better traction in snow/wet conditions, but has issues if you accelerate and turn at same time. AWD is the best because it has benefits of front and rear wheel drive, shifting power as needed to compensate for loss of traction.",eli5

2uecaz,How did Goldman Sachs fabricate Greece's transition into the Eurozone? ,"The Eurozone is made up of the European states that have adopted the Euro currency, governed by a single central bank with a single monetary policy, interest rates, etc.

So, because the economies of these nations are intimately entwined, there are certain restrictions on how the member state's governments can act; particularly when it comes to national debt.

Greece paid Goldman Sachs to create a series of, I guess the correct term is 'financial products' but there is no way it was anything other than fraud.

Basically, these instruments enable you to restructure your debt by agreeing to swap the currency of the debt for a period - to be exchanged back into the original currencies at a later date.  

So instead of owing €1bn, the debt becomes $1.13bn US (at today's exchange rate).  This is normal and part of the way governments deal with their debts.  However, because the debt is always going to be converted back to the original currency, there is no reason for you to use today's exchange rate.  You could use the exchange rate of €1,000 = $1.  Now, instead of owing one billion Euros, you only have a debt of one million US dollars with, and here's the key bit, **an obligation to convert it back into a debt of one billion Euros** at some point in the future.  

TLDR; Greece was able to make it look like they had a lot less debt than they did and they did not disclose their obligations fully when becoming part of the Eurozone.

5su7hv,Why are patients put on antibiotics every time they have dental work after they have had a knee replacement?,"Because when dental care is done bacteria from the mouth are often released into the blood stream for example if your gums bleed then there is a good chance bacteria will get in.

Now bacteria that survive can attach to surfaces inside the body like heart valves and implants like knees and form bio-films which can grow and cause local and systemic infections.

Bio-films are really hard to kill with antibiotics because they only work on the surface bacteria and don't penetrate into the sheet of bactera.

The only real way to get rid of them then is to go back in and replace the implant. 

So the short answer is to prevent needing to replace implants and prevention of internal infections by killing bactera early before they can attach and form bio-films.",eli5

I constantly hear people tell me how lucky I am because I have a high metabolism, but when we sit down to eat, it's immediately obvious that my metabolism has a lot less to do with it than the fact that their plate has 2-3 times as much food on it as mine, they are drinking 1-2 glasses of soda with their meal (I usually drink water), then have seconds and/or desert, and afterward they would never think of taking the stairs instead of the elevator.

I understand encryption and all that, but if a disk has the binary data the exact same how could it tell the difference? ","You can duplicate the disc exactly, and the Xbox won't be able to tell it apart from an original disc. The trick is, you need to have the equipment to manufacture DVDs. I don't suppose you have a DVD factory sitting around in your living room, do you?

Most of the data on a DVD is just a single long stream divided into groups of 2048 bytes called ""sectors"". That's the part that you usually deal with when you copy a disc. When you don't have to worry about DRM, that's the only part you need in order to have a working copy.

However, there's some more data that you can't copy so easily. At the very beginning of the disc, before the first sector, is the ""lead-in"". The lead-in is designed to be used only by the disc drive, so it doesn't contain anything you'd need most of the time. You can't read it with a regular disc drive, and it gets automatically generated when you burn data to a blank disc.

2p8d2z,"Why Do Most Games These Days Indicate Loading With An Icon Instead of a Bar? I remember back in 1990's to mid-2000's, video games used loading bars to signify how much a level has loaded before playing. The bar would fill up as more of the game loads until the loading is complete (the bar is full to show that). Nowadays, most video games use an icon that just spins or blinks, completely depriving the player of any indication of progress.

Why have more video games been showing the icon instead of a bar during loading? Do they look more visually pleasing? Are they less irritating to look at just because the bar stopping at certain points would make the player angry?

Example: [Loading Bar (Bottom of the Screen)](_URL_1_) vs. [Loading Icon (Bottom Right-Hand Corner)](_URL_0_)","One less feature to support.

Loading bars are actually pretty hard to do correctly. How much work is left to be done? What percentage of it is done? Keeping track of that adds development overhead to some overworked teams, and usually isn't particularly accurate.

Modern game UIs tend to be heavyweight, too. Many of them involve libraries such as Scaleform (Flash), or even full 3D rendering, and it can be easier to skip all that and just throw an image up -- both in terms of development and runtime performance.

Also, many games try to have shorter loading times, now.

But sometimes you'll have two actors of similar stature in the same production. Clearly, both of them can't be listed first, so the next best thing is to be at the end of the credits. Typically, it's separated from the rest of the actors with the word ""and"" or ""with"", and sometimes the character name is listed as a way to make the credit stand out more, even though it's not top-billed.

Humans aren't there because radiation sickness hurts, so why aren't the animals dying as well?","In order to overdose on tylenol, you have to take a large amount in a short period of time.

Similarly, ""radiation sickness"" or acute radiation injury requires a large dose of radiation in a short amount of time.  The radiation dose rate isn't high enough inside the disaster zone to trigger this effect (with the exception of areas inside the reactor building itself *edit* and a few other localized areas of high contamination).  Ionizing radiation damages DNA, and your body has many DNA repair mechanisms.  A large dose of radiation in a short period of time can overload those mechanisms, leading to radiation injury.

The reason humans aren't allowed to live there isn't because of radiation sickness.  It is because the elevated amounts of radiation would lead to slightly increased cancer risks.  Many people ignore the orders and continue to live there.  You can read about them [here](_URL_0_).",eli5

6iilxh,Why would the devil punish you for breaking the rules of his enemy?,"Cuz the devil was a made up concept for a made up concept.

There's no real indication in biblical text of Satan, lucifer, and the morning star being the same entity.. Revelation is the only book that indicates an evil/antagonistic being, and it was written after Christ died, but outside of that there are loose interpretations of Satan being an enemy of god...everything has a purpose, and everything is planned and known. God has knowledge of his creations pasts and futures, and angels don't have free will like humans, so there is an issue with that logic as well...

The devil and hell was really a construct of dark age/post Rome Christianity. It helped reinforce the idea that people better conform to certain principles, otherwise their punishment will extend beyond this life for eternity..as well as causing people who had relatives that were sent to hell or limbo to atone for their loved ones sins, causing non-stop selflessness that was enriching the church/state/empire further..

Simple contradictions like this occur in all religion doctrine and accepted views..

5a27cm,Why do we use pumpkins at Halloween?,"People have been carving vegetables for as long as people have been around, had primitive carving tools, and religious or ritual reasons.

Nobody's quite sure how or when the idea of jack-o-lanterns began, but it's believed to come from carving turnips and gourds in Scotland or Ireland a few hundred years back. The idea was either that the lantern warded off evil spirits, or represented the dead, whose souls were supposed to be wandering our world around that time of year.

Pumpkins rolled into the scene in the early 1800s in America, probably. We're not sure why for sure, I'm afraid. Probably a combination of being widely available, large, and naturally suited to carving faces into. Sleepy Hollow mentions the headless horseman having a jack-o-lantern in place of his head, which he throws, and a smashed pumpkin is then found at the spot, so as far as we know it's the earliest mention of pumpkins being used for them. An 1866 newspaper talks about the use of pumpkins as ""an old tradition.""

mfb0g,why taxation is important in a government fiscal policy and how does it works. also broad based tax? what on the earth is that? Is it more ideal compare to progressive tax where the rich pay a higher tax rate? ,"Everyone likes roads.  Roads are great for making sure your car can get to the store, your school, and the Chuck E. Cheese.  People like the police, too (sort of).  The police help protect you from bad guys.

Who builds the roads, though?  Would you start a road building company? Yeah, it might be sort of fun, but how you would you make money to pay your employees?

Or what about the police? Who pays them to do their job?

The government pays the road builders and the police, of course, but the government can't get money from out of thin air.  So where can the government get money to pay road builders and policemen?

One way might be to charge everyone who uses a road.  Every time you go down a road, you would have to stop and pay a few dollars to use the road that day.  And every time a policeman stopped a criminal in your neighborhood or found your stolen wallet, he'd send you a bill for the service.

That might work, but it's a lot of hassle.  Also, there are some things where it would be hard to tell who is getting benefit from them and should owe money.  You wouldn't want to have to insert a quarter to turn on the street light as you walk your dog after dark, would you?  Not only would it be a hassle, someone else walking behind you could use the same light that you just paid for, but for free!

Instead, governments collect taxes.  A tax is a certain amount of money collected from everyone in the city, state, or country, that helps to pay for all these services.  Some taxes are flat - everyone pays the exact same amount every year.  Some taxes are related to income or purchases - you pay a percentage of the money you have.  A lot of people disagree on what way of deciding how much you pay is fair.  Should rich people have to pay more, since they have more?

Another issue is that it can be hard for the government to know exactly how much money it will need each year, and exactly how much money a new tax would bring in.  This is part of why there's so many big arguments about taxes.",eli5

That being said, illegals do have effects. They generally take very low paying jobs in agriculture or industrial work, and as a result compete with American workers. However, there's also quite a bit of evidence to suggest that Americans simply won't do the kinds of jobs illegals end up doing in the United States, and because they lack proper identification they can't really work ""real"" jobs in the US at all.

The biggest problems are that illegal immigration is going to be associated with all sorts of other negative issues, particularly crime, gang, and drug related stuff, but that's also pretty much confined to areas where illegals end up living (e.g. they're a problem in Texas or Southern California, but not in North Dakota).

1g6opc,Why is it that when we do something pleasurable (e.g. eating) we often (at least I think so) save the best for last? ,"Perhaps it comes down to the concepts of **gathering** and **ownership**. We love to savor all sorts of experiences, from eating to watching a certain movie to planning that first kiss with a new lover. 

Savoring, in my eyes, is very similar to owning. I notice my dog doing this all the time, and the habit transcends to humans. She will take a bone, chew it for a short amount of time, and then just sort of.. spend time with it. If she thinks I mean to take the bone away, back she will go and have great passion for it again. 

If we have a big steak on the plate, our prize and joy - We like to extend the feeling of attainment and ownership for as long as possible. If you eat all the steak first, the plate looks underwhelming and maybe a little more feeble. But, as long as some of the best stuff is still there, we are in a constant state of pride of our possession. 

.

Another angle, not so much to do with food is that as humans we love **anticipation**. It is an extremely powerful distraction - if you are going through hell, the knowledge that something amazing is on the horizon is enough to give you pre-cursory joy for whatever that special treat is. A good example is TV - people may anticipate Game Of Thrones, and it is a tense but exciting week full of speculation, excitement and most of all distraction. Once the episode is out, I would be interested to know how many people actually dive to watch it. After that wait, it almost feels sweeter to wait just a little longer, and let the anticipation really burn in your heart.

If it can alter the flavor, does this have something to do with the different ratio of air:food that's hitting your taste buds?","The air content of food can definitely affect its flavour, yes.  A good example is milk foam on a specialty coffee's top where you have added air to make it frothy. 

But that's not so much the case of identical pasta that's formed into different shapes. There it's more about the water content and the size and consistency of the chunks you are eating. A large-unit pasta like a linguine has bigger chunks of pasta and less sauce than a small-unit pasta like orzo (essentially rice grains) or couscous (essentially tiny pellets). Generally people don't chew pasta much when they eat it so the larger types are generally preserved until you swallow them.

Eating is a whole experience that doesn't just involve taste and smell. There's texture and mouth feel and moisture content too, and all of these things can affect the flavour you perceive. Even without sauce, a mouthful of very overcooked boxed spaghetti tastes very different from a proper 'al dente' plate of freshly made spaghetti, for example.

(Finally, some pastas like whole wheat spaghetti and egg noodles really do have different flavour because they're made with different additions and different types of base grain.)",eli5

47iqvj,"Why does putting a mug of water in the microwave keep bread from getting soggy when heated? Edit: For everybody asking about microwaving frozen bread I was meaning like a biscuit or a roll, not slices of sandwich bread.","The water acts as a 'dummy load' when you have it in the microwave with bread. So it reduces the amount of energy going to the bread. Think of it in terms of cranking down an energy knob. The higher the energy the faster it heats up which means it gets soggy. If you have less energy and cook it slowly and evenly it won't get soggy.

 & nbsp;



**Edit: Some additional details. Happy to see all the interest in this.**

It's assumed the bread is frozen.
**Why is the bread frozen?** *It stays fresher longer. Good for when you're living by yourself and don't go through food as fast. As a poor graduate student who knows the struggle lol.*

**Can I lower the power for the same effect?** *Yes, basically it will do the same thing. Lowering the amount of energy reduces the amount of 'work' used to heat the bread. You'll have a lower temperature and this will allow for the heat to dissipate evenly throughout the bread.*

**Wait a minute, what happens if I heat room temperature bread?** *If you heat it the moisture from the bread will be released and moisten the bread. If you do this with water that water will be 'added' to the atmosphere in the microwave and may condense to make the bread wet on the outside. Of course if you heat it long enough it will dry out or burn.*

**Edit 2: Why does bread get soggy?** *At room temperature for example the bread is saturated with moisture, kind of like a damp sponge that has been sitting out for a couple hours. If you heat it up it softens the pores of the material and you get that 'soggyness'. When heating frozen bread at high temperatures it can be concentrated in certain areas and the heat may not be able to spread out. If you lower that temperature the heat can spread out and let the vapor escape.*

 & nbsp;


*I worked in a bioenergy lab for a year with some people who studied pyrolysis with domestic and industrial microwaves. We had a metal 'mixer' to mix up the wood pellets or other biomass. We used water as a dummy load so that the microwaves would not be reflected back and damage the magnetron.*",eli5

alswyi,"What is bone marrow donation process, why it is used, how dors it takes place, does donating it affects your rest of life and why it is so important for life saving operations? ","**Short answer:** It's mostly used to regenerate the bone marrow of people who have to get really intense cancer treatment. It's very safe for the donor and has no long-term effects--it involves either them taking it out with a needle or extracting it from a blood sample you give. 

**Long answer:** Bone marrow is mostly used for bone marrow/stem cell transplants.

The white and red blood cells in your body are made in the bone marrow. One of the really bad things that happens when you get chemotherapy for cancer is that it damages the bone marrow, meaning that you stop being able to make blood cells and are at serious risk for infections and anemia.

In certain types of cancer, they've found that what's really effective is giving super high doses of chemotherapy that can cure the cancer but completely destroy your bone marrow. To save your life, they then give you a transplant of bone marrow from a healthy person (or from a sample you gave before treatment).

There are two ways of collecting bone marrow. One is by literally sticking a big needle into your hip bones while you're under sedation and sucking some out. The other one is by giving you a few drugs that cause your bone marrow to ""spit out"" some of its special cells into your blood. They can then just take a blood sample and separate out the bone marrow cells.

Either way is quite safe for the donor--the second one is really no different than donating blood except for having to get a shot or two beforehand. If you don't have any underlying issues, your bone marrow will regenerate itself just fine and you won't have any long-term side effects.",eli5

I know from a brief on EOD robots that many pieces of military hardware are already being controlled by an Xbox or Playstation controller. This made me think of how in many video games (Just Cause 2 and Halo: Reach come to mind), it is very easy to take off, maneuver, and land a helicopter using the same thing. I also remembered how when I flew a UH-1 Huey simulator, it was actually pretty difficult because of all the different controls (pedals, stick, engine power).

Would it be possible to create a system for each airframe to where someone proficient in flying aircraft in video games would be able to pretty much pick up the controller and only need a few minutes or hours to get used to it?","There are some UAVs that do it. But they're flying themselves and you're making suggestions. If something goes wrong, you may lose the UAV, but the damage and loss of life will be minimal (other than the loss of the UAV, which is kind of their purpose anyway, to take risks so soldiers/people don't have to).

But with larger aircraft, even though they have sophisticated autopilot systems, there are still times when you need/want to have a human take full control. The main problem is those tiny little sticks, compared to the travel distance of the yoke.

Just imagine fighting the wind, and you need 12 degrees yoke up when you have 9 inches of travel, versus 12 degrees up when you have half-an-inch. (Though really, you'd just adjust your trim if it was constant, but same point.)",eli5

Why can't NASA take high quality images on/around mars as they do with supernovae or earth even? Does it have something to do with the distance they travel or the heat or maybe they're just old spacecraft that don't have updated technology?","Partially they're older. Partially they need to be very robust since replacing a defective one isn't exactly practical, so everything will be built bigger and tougher. Partly it needs to be resistant to a high energy environment due to radiation and solar particles. They can still get images in conditions that would make a typical phone camera image quality go to hell if it didn't shit the bed entirely. And then they also need every pixel to collect a lot more light than we need to worry about in our day to day use which again means they're bigger.",eli5

3k4p4z,Why was Greenwich Mean Time changed to Coordinated Universal Time? ,"It wasn't. GMT was changed to UT1. 

GMT and UTC are actually completely different: GMT is time based on the *sun*. ""Mean"" in GMT refers to the fact that it is based on *mean* (i.e. average) solar time. On the other hand, UTC is *atomic* time, based on vibrations of radiation given off by atoms. At the precision of milliseconds, the Solar day is variable in length, Earth's rotation is slowing, and a solar day is no longer exactly equal to 86,400 seconds. These clocks therefore tick at different rates.

But it makes sense that atomic time should roughly agree (i.e., be ""coordinated"") with solar time for practical purposes. That is why, every once in a while, a leap second is added to UTC: to keep it within 1 second of GMT (or really, GMT's successor, UT1).

TL;DR: GMT (or really, UT1 now) is solar time, whose rate of flow is slower now than in the past, and varies at the level of milliseconds because of changes in the Earth's rotation rate. UTC is atomic time, with an absolutely constant rate of flow that must be periodically adjusted (""coordinated"") to stay within 1 second of UT1.",eli5

I know they throw around terms like ""triple filtered"" and stuff, but what exactly does that do and why does it affect the flavor and sensation the way it does?","When spirits are distilled, the liquid comes out in 3 parts, heads first, then the heart, then the tails. The heads and tails contain lots of nasty things such as fusel oils. The best spirits / top shelf producers only take a small part of the heart which contains the cleanest spirit. This means less hangover/bad shit in your body. The quality of the raw ingredients and distillation equipment/methods also contribute significantly to the end products quality. 

Also, if a spirit is aged for a long time in wooden barrels, this process rounds off the harshness that may be found in unaged spirits. This also imparts some of the qualities of the wood such as vanilla flavours/woodiness. It can also however add hangover-causing congeners due to the chemical relationship between wood and alcohol.",eli5

6c7zdh,Why can't you feel it when you're on a commerical flight and the airplane makes a turn that is practically perpendicular to the ground? ,"When you're in a turning vehicle, ""centrifugal force"" (*) tends to push you toward the outside of the turn.  At the same time, gravity pushes you downward, so the total force on you is down and outward, on a diagonal.

When a pilot makes a ""coordinated turn"", he/she tilts the plane to an angle that matches the direction of this diagonal force, so it pushes you straight down into your seat rather than sideways.  As a result, you'll feel a bit heavier during the turn, but you won't be pushed to the right or left.

(*) Centrifugal force is not a real force, but it's a useful way of understanding this at the ELI5 level.  The explanation would be twice as long without it, but would end up at the same conclusion: the tilt of the plane ensures that the force on you is aligned with your seat.",eli5

39by1b,How come when I'm asleep my brain can create life like worlds but when I'm awake I can't even picture someone's face? ,"Actually when you are awake your brain is creating a far more richly detailed world than it does when you are asleep - but using the inputs from your senses rather than from your memory. It may seem like you are experiencing the world directly when you are awake rather than experiencing a recreation of it, but ""you"" are a brain isolated inside a head and everything you see and hear is not the actual sights or sounds of the world, but a recreation of it based on the inputs from your eyes and ears.

I'd say when you are asleep your brain is doing far _less_ creating than when you are awake.

1sjvbe,What is a religion and why are there so many that exist? ,"According to Wikipedia, ""Religion is an organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence""

In general, as humanity has grown out of the muck, stories such as oral traditions, mythos, legends, etc. have been an integral part of culture. In some cases, those traditions can become something more than just story, and take on a significance in the culture that is a way for a group of people to understand and interpret the happenings of life and death.

For instance, lets say we have a small village, of which a great warrior named Ug. Ug goes off and defends the village from many invaders, and eventually dies. They bury him, idolize him, and tell stories of him.

Perhaps over time, the village considers the possibility (or perhaps such a concept already existed) that the soul/spirit of a person can remain behind, and so it is surmised that the spirit of Ug might still visit the village. Now the villagers begin to engage in simple rituals to honor/invoke Ug, either out of respect or in the hopes Ug's spirit will protect the village.

As more time passes, these original rituals may become more and more important, and the village may begin to craft a world view that holds Ug as central - things like the Weather, Crops, Health, enemy incursions, etc. all become associated with Ug.

The village has found Ug to be their way of interpreting the world around them. They have culture and history to support this, and Ug's worship becomes a part of their daily lives. Depending on how well the village does in the future, they may very well become an Empire founded on the shoulders of the Great Warrior Ug.

As far as 'why are there so many,' humans have a great many different cultures across the world, each with their own interpretations of how the 'world works,' so to speak. Depending on how that culture's oral/written traditions play out, the nature of a religious movement will vary. Sometimes as cultures intermix and intermingle, religious oral/written traditions become changed over time. For instance, in India, the Dravidian and Aryan cultures intermixed, and there are portions of both Dravidian and Aryan religious beliefs that can be found in Hindhuism today.",eli5

Helicopters use one giant rotor for direction and lift while the tail rotor is simply to counter the primary rotor.

Which means less math which means less compute power on board.

For a very large aircraft I would assume that the costs of doing four rotors and four engines become cost prohibitive and hence why designs still favored the standard helicopter with a single primary rotor. So I don't think we'll see anytime soon people being transported in four propeller systems.",eli5

To be bored often means to be unmotivated, unstimulated, and our brains need constant stimulation, so we are used to the fact of being constantly stimulated

There's [a great video by Vsauce](_URL_0_) on the topic that will probably make it easier to understand.

A fantastic quote by Louis CK that I'm sure we all have heard at least one time is:

 > ""'I'm bored' is a useless thing to say. I mean, we live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless: goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you're alive is amazing, so you don't get to say 'I'm bored'"".

On the other hand, animals who lay around all day every day would eventually get used to it, specially if born in such circumstances.
But the point is that animals such as pets don't have the notion of time that we do. Most of us get bored when we're doing nothing at all, right? We are thinking about what we should be doing at that time and how to fill that gap with some activity, animals don't *exactly* do that.  
Notice how a dog that hasn't been out all day gets very excited when you take him to the park, a dog that has been out several times in one day most probably would react differently to stimulating activities, since it would be tired and not in the mood for going out again, just like humans, tho that doesn't mean they get bored the *same* way we do.",eli5

If plans with specific deadlines are created, then why are they always delayed?","Extensive projects require teams of people and supplies in diverse fields to work together.

Whatever project is at hand isn't the only project that each team is working on and even the *individuals* in each team may also be involved in a wide range of other concurrent projects.

Getting supplies to arrive on time for construction projects is a nightmare at best. You constantly end up with plumbers ready to work on their scheduled day but no pipes to install. Or the pipes show up but the electrician needs access to the location where the plumbers need to work. Then the fire marshal shows up for an inspection, and the crane operator is sick, etc etc.

One thing about scientific projects: When the scientist in the documentary says, ""I've been working on this Mars Rover project for 15 years now..."" what you have to get is that the one project being highlighted in the documentary is not the scientist's full time job. Every working scientist is involved in a myriad of various research projects concurrently and they usually teach classes as well so these are busy people.

Scientific projects generally involve a great many unknown issues that have to be thought through on a theoretical basis and then implemented by engineers. The theories and the engineering don't always work out and even when they do the unknowns usually have new surprises that send everybody back to the drawing board.

Sending stuff to Mars for modern people is like the Ancient Egyptians deciding to build a glass and steel skyscraper. We know its do-able but working out the details the first time is a bear of a task.

Then there's funding. I won't even go into it.

Then (with space projects) there's the window of accessible orbit matching up with available space on a particular rocket launch. Miss that window, miss that launch (or the rocket blows up on the pad) and your project just got pushed back until the next available window which could be years away.

What is truly amazing is that any project *ever* gets completed (some don't.) That's partially why people are *so* excited when something actually works the way it is intended.",eli5

9z2efm,Why are snowflakes ALWAYS symmetrical and 6 sided?,"Because that is the fundamental symmetry of solid water.

If you have ever looked at salt - ordinary table salt - under a microscope, or even just with a magnifying glass, you have probably noticed that it looks more or less [like a bunch of little cubes](_URL_0_). That is because the salt, like all crystalline substances, is made of tiny repeating units - and in the case of salt, this repeating unit is a cube, and so the symmetry of the cube is the fundamental symmetry of salt.

Water, on the other hand, has a hexagonal fundamental symmetry when frozen. This is because the water molecule is bent, at about a 105 degree angle between the two O-H bonds. Water also readily forms hydrogen bonds, where a hydrogen atom of one water molecule gets weakly bonded to the oxygen atom of another. These two conspire to make water arrange itself, when frozen, into a [hexagonal lattice](_URL_1_) of molecules, that are hydrogen-bonded together, and it is this structure that is reflected in the shape of snowflakes.

TL;DR: All crystalline substances have a fundamental shape/symmetry to them, and with water that fundamental symmetry happens to be hexagonal.",eli5

This circuit is filled with a gas that becomes liquid when you compress it. Other than this there is a part of oil in the circuit, that helps the lubrification of the compressor

When you move the refrigerator, transport it, stock it in unusual positions or whatever you basically ""shake"" this gas/liquid/oil inside the tubes, leaving some parts of the pipes filled with gas, some with liquid, bubbles everywhere.

Leaving it still for a while (usually 2/4h is enough, someone suggest even 12/24h) will make sure that the liquid part will deposit on the bottom of the circuit (where the compressor is located) and gas will go ""up"" (where there is no liquid).

When your muscles need more you receive sympathetic stimuli that dilates the arteries in your muscles and contract the ones where you don't need, the bowels. Your body wanna be ready to run from a lion.
When you eat your body receives parasympathetic stimuli. Now it's time to digest, your bowels need a lot a blood and your muscles better not try to steal it. So it's a evolutionary strategy to make you feel sleepy so that you will only move if really necessary.
If you try to move you may vomit, that happens in swimming pools often.

62k94s,"why voting for your preferred candidate in instant runoff voting can cause them to lose (and vice versa). I have a vague idea after reading and hearing some explanations, but it's still hard to grasp.  Thanks in advance.","Voting for your candidate in instant runoff voting could cause them to lose is a very convoluted and highly unlikely scenario. 

Consider this (fictional) example using Trump, Clinton, Sanders. 

Assume that Trump is the favorite to win in a three way race using first past the post voting (Trump wins the more votes but not more than half). You support Trump against two the two rivals who are running neck and neck... you really want to run against Clinton because you know you can beat Clinton, but, since politics is very complicated, polls indicate you are likely to lose in a head to head battle with Sanders.

**Recall:** *In three way race using instant runoff voting when there is no clear majority winner, the third place candidate is eliminated.*

In this scenario, you are likely to want Sanders to be eliminated in the elimination round so you can run against (and beat) Clinton... 

Enough people will still need to vote for Trump to assure that Trump is not the third place candidate, but maybe not too many... if it turns out that Sanders is likely to beat out Clinton for second place it may make sense for a few Trump voters to actually support Clinton so that Sanders is eliminated... leaving your Candidate Trump to defeat Clinton in a head to head battle. In this case, your vote for Trump could actually cause Trump to lose the election.

7mqqgy,"When you have a stuffed nose, why is it that one nostril is always blocked/more blocked","Importantly, the blockage is not ""stuff"" (like mucus/snot) that's clogging up the nostril;  it's the lining of the nose swelling up and closing off the airway.

There are two important facts to know about blocked noses:

1. There's something called the ""nasal cycle"" that occurs normally, where the mucus membrane in your nostrils swells slightly, alternating between nostrils throughout the day.  This happens all the time, every day, but isn't severe enough to really be noticeable.

2. When you have a cold, the mucus membranes in *both* nostrils swell slightly as part of your body's immune response.

When you combine the two, the nostril that's normally slightly swollen from the nasal cycle gets even *more* swollen because of the cold, and that nostril swells shut.  That's why blowing your nose doesn't fix it (it's not blocked by anything that can be blown out), why it switches nostrils occasionally (the nasal cycles changes which nostril is swollen more than the other), and why nose drops don't completely fix the issue (they can't completely eliminate the extra swelling from having a cold).",eli5

1wvvk5,"Why do girls, with virtually no boobs, wear bras? Hi!

Just thought if this as I, in my hallway, looked at my magnificent semi-fatguy-goes-bodybuilding-body; I've got bigger boobs than my ex-gf and my current. 
Both of them uses bras, but I don't. I don't see why I should wear one. They, on the other hand, who are as good as completely flat with the bras off, uses them.
There's nothing to support, really, so that one reason probably goes away. 

So, why is this? Marketing? Habit? Because girls are supposed to wear them? Trying to make the boobs look bigger like some Spinal Tap-stuffing-thingie? 

I don't want to ask my gf, because I don't want her to think that I don't like the way she looks :)

TL;DR Why do girls without boobs wear bras when there are nothing to really lift/support/whatever?
","Firstly, there is often more breast tissue than is immediately apparent. For wide-rooted breasts, a significant portion of breast tissue can lie around the underarm area. So don't underestimate the mass of boob just because they don't stick out much at the front! 

A well-fitted bra will support all the tissue and cup it so that the stuff which tends to lie at the sides is comfortably moved to create fuller breasts and more cleavage. 

Breast tissue can also be very uncomfortable when moving quickly, especially when jogging. Imagine wearing a hoodie, with something heavy in the pocket on the front. You know the way it bounces around when you run? That's how boobs feel, even small ones, and it can be painful! The right bra eliminates that. 

They can also protect sore breasts and nipples from rubbing, smooth outlines under clothing, and make you feel good about your body.",eli5

4ce6j6,"Why can't we remember a dream we just had minutes after waking up, yet a lot of times we can remember the dream from that night a few moments before falling asleep? I have seen some answers of the first part of this question (why can't we remember what we were dreaming even a few minutes after we wake up) but I have not seen any regarding how we suddenly can recall details of what we were dreaming the night before moments before falling asleep.  ","EDIT: I think I forgot the whole ""like i'm five"" part, first time posting here, sorry about that. Stick to the two tl;dr's for a quick explanation. 

First part of the question : 1. Our brain is always trying to do its best. 2. Though we can't really tell if our memory is unlimited or not, we know for a fact that different memories can disturb and block each other, and we can only intake so much at a given time. 3. Your brain knows what a dream is, and knows that it isn't real; it classifies that information as irrelevant and doesn't encode it in long term memory as deeply as it would for some relevant information. The memory of your dream being poorly encoded it becomes really hard to retrieve. 

tl:dr : The brain knows a dream isn't real, thus not important, so it doesn't do much to keep that information around.

Second part of the question : ""State Dependant Memory"" ( See work by Bower, 1980ish). This theory ( that has been backed up by a fuckton of literature ), suggests that when you learn something in a certain mental state ( mood, context, etc) you will be better at retrieving that information when you're again in the same mood. If I tell you my name when you're sad, the next time you're sad you'll be faster at remembering my name. This applies generally to a ""mental state"" not just a strict mood (happy, sad, etc), I'm guessing that your bedtime and morning rituals are almost always the same and your pretty much always set it a similar mental state. This promotes the retrieval of information that you learned around that time another day. 

Also, though this isn't technically State Dependant Memory, context plays an important role in Declarative Memory (pretty much stories), information isn't encoded by itself, it is associated to the context you learn it in. There was a famous experiment with divers learning stuff while diving and then seperated in two groups; one has to recall once again while diving, the other group recalls on dry land, the first group has better results. 
This is backed up by the Spreading Activation Theory of memory; for more info I'd suggest looking at Quillian ( 1950s) for the baby steps of the theory, and especially Collings and Loftus (1980s) that resume it really well. 
In short, this theory states that each concept or group of concepts is one ""node"", each node is related to other ones by semantic links ( chiken is linked to egg, rooster, etc). Activating one node will spread the activation to the linked nodes and promotes their activation. New links are created and others reinforced constantly each time you think/see/hear information. So, what does this mean for us : The stuff in your dream was linked to your bed, your room, bedtime, etc because it was learned while that stuff was also activated ( two things activated at the same time links them). So when you activate the node for ""bed"", well it will help you activate your memory of the dream. 

tl;dr : if you learn something in a ceartain mental state (bed time mood or whatever you call it), or in a certain context (in your bed, in your pyjamas, etc), you will be better at remembering that stuff while in the same mood/context. 

Source: Masters degree in Neuropsychology, I am currently writing a thesis on the relation between memory and physical pain, the Spreading Activation Theory, State Dependant Memory and Mood Congruity Effect ( closely related to State Dependant Memory though irrelevant to the dream question) are at the core of my thesis. 

EDIT: Some detail on what I said about memory being or not being unlimited : Some forms of autisms are indicating that our memory can be way more powerful than how it is for a normal brain. We do not know for sure, but the main hypothesis states that it isn't them that have some special super memory, it's that a normal brain actively incapacitates its memory, reduces the intake and retrieval capacity. And those forms of autism don't have the mental ""brake"".

I remember just in the last few years reading that Puerto Rico had voted to join the union, but nothing ever came of it. Why?

Additionally, why is there so little interest in adding more states to the Union? It seems like we were all about acquiring territories and increasing the size and reach of the United States. What changed?

Or did we just say, ""Ah, 50 is a nice even number, let's stop there?""",">  especially since there have been successful campaigns for various territories to acquire statehood? 

Um, no.  The Puerto Rico vote was a farce. 

Here is how it worked.  PR is roughly evenly split between people who want to be a country, people who want to be a state, and people who want to be a territory.

So they had this gimmicky two-part vote.  The first question asked if you wanted PR to remain a territory.  The second asked if you preferred to be a state or country.  Since more people wanted it to not a territory, and *slight* more people wanted state than country, it made it look like state won, despite not having anything near a majority.",eli5

Is it also possible the speed of light ""speed limit"" is just a limit of our ability to observe anything faster? ","Basically Einstein's theory is based around the observation that speed of light is the absolute fastest that effect can propagate from a cause. If I wink an eye at you, Einstein claims that there is nothing, even in principle, that could inform you of this action having happened faster than speed of light. If I wink at you one lightyear away, there is no way whatsoever you could tell that I have winked at you before one year has passed(well, assuming you remain still)

If I traveled at you faster than speed of light, I could tell you ahead of time that I was winking at you. This could, with little engineering and tinkering, be turned into fully functional time machine, so basically any proposal of faster-than-light travel is also a proposal for time machine design(The exact mechanism by which you can turn faster-than-light travel into time machines is a bit complicated, and really if you're not into engineering suffice to say, it's doable. If you ARE into engineering, you could probably get kicks out of designing your own time machine like this)

I walked through them without earbuds and there was no pitch. 

What is causing these detectors to emit a high pitched noise in my earbuds whenever I walk past them?","Because the detectors transmit a signal that interferes with the amplifier in your audio player.

Those detectors work in a couple of ways - One is where the signal they transmit is picked up by a coil in the book, which is connected to a small chip that transmits it's number whenever it gets power. The coils pick up this number, and the computer checks that the book linked to it has been properly checked out. 

The other is that the signal simply induces a current in a coil attached to the book, robbing energy from the system. The system detects this and knows that a tag is passing by. For these, the tag is either removed or disabled when the book is checked out.

Both of these rely on signals that can be picked up by a simple audio amplifier.",eli5

Well, it turns out [our immune systems have a similar ""circadian rhythm"" based on time of day.](_URL_0_)

During the day, your immune system mostly uses a process called cell-mediated immunity, where cells (mostly T-cells) act like soldiers that go out and ""fight"" the germs. For the most part, you don't notice the effects of that fight, aside from the general symptoms of feeling sick. However, those T-cells become less active during our rest periods (probably because our body wants them to be fully active the next day when we're awake). Again, the change in activity probably isn't noticeable by itself.

What you do notice is what your body uses to make up for the decrease: Inflammation. Instead of soldiers fighting, inflammation is your body calling in a napalm strike to try to burn out the germs. In the process, you get feelings like fever, feeling tired, increased ""stuffiness"" from mucus and swelling, and all that other miserable stuff.

tl;dr: The active part of your immune system ""sleeps"" just like you, so your body uses inflammation instead. And inflammation sucks.",eli5

4bh8pg,Why is Greece in so much debt? What exactly did Greece do to be in their current situation?,"Some people think the problems in Greece are just because it spent too much and ignored the EU rules. The reality is a bit more complicated. Many countries have had debt problems: Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Italy all have Government Gross debt to GDP ratios  > 100%. Then again so does the [US](_URL_7_). Looking at all of these countries helps understand the problems a bit better.

Until 2007, [Ireland](_URL_4_) and [Spain](_URL_2_) had budget surpluses, so it isn't just about managing the government budget well.

The Greek government wrote a [report on the causes](_URL_0_), and [The Economist](_URL_6_) has a few good articles on the subject, but I think there are other factors.

* In 2008, the Greek economy wan't growing as fast as other parts of the EU. Growth in other parts of EU was pushing up costs.

* Greece has had a long problem with tax evasion and an unwillingness to tax the rich, because they would just leave. As with a lot of the rest of the world the economic growth that did exist was entirely for the rich, so there was no increase in income or sales tax revenue. 

*  Germany violated the [EU Sustainability and Growth Pact from 2003-2007](_URL_1_). This is one of the ways that Germany (and therefore the EU average) was managing to grow faster. Part of the reason for the pact was to keep the EU growth in step, but no one else wanted to slow down when they had a  chance to ""win"".

* From 2004-2009 Government debt grew. This was partly because of a decade of low interest rates. Cheap loans caused household, corporate and government debt to grow. Was it a bad idea? Most financial advisers would say it's smart to borrow to grow when money is cheap. The European banks certainly borrowed more heavily than Greece ever did.

* 2007-2008 there was a global financial crisis. This caused a huge jump in unemployment which increased welfare costs. These expenses rose just as tax revenues dropped. The problem was worse in countries that had seen a property boom, like Greece.

* Bank bailouts. The banks', which borrowed even more aggressively than Greece did, ran into financial problems which meant that some countries (most notably Ireland and Spain, but also Greece) needed to find money to support them, while other countries left them to fail (really only Iceland).

* A lot of the Greek debt was to other European countries, so Germany was putting a lot of pressure on Greece to not default on the loans. Germany thinks that investments in Greece should have no risk because Greece shouldn't be allowed to default. In some ways the German government loans to Greece can be seen as a way to subsidize Germans speculating in the Greek real-estate market.

* Once it became clear that Greek loans were not zero-risk, and some would not be paid off, some investors wanted better interest rates, and others just walked away. This caused falling bond prices, higher interest, and slower growth.

* The EU aid to Greece was never realistic and the repayment terms just made things worse. The Greek austerity measures pushed by Germany are [comparable to the German austerity measures after WW1](_URL_3_) which were a complete failure. Greece even pointed this out by reminding Germany still owes then 278B Euros form WW2. [The IMF has also said that the debt repayment terms are impossible](_URL_5_), which is starting to make Germany renegotiate.",eli5

Everything about bartering price is our own fault as an industry. We don't want it, and to my knowledge it is an entirely American idea. But as an industry we have not only allowed it to happen, but we have made our customers expect it. 

I believe it originated in the 50s after manufacturing became cheaper, salesman thought by making the sticker price more than they could realistically sell the car for they would make the customer think they got a good deal when in reality they paid what the salesman originally wanted for it. Now we can't get out of this.

 In all honesty proffit on a new car sale at the dealership level averages between $1200 and $2000. The dealership's price on a car will probably have about 3k added to the invoice price (this is what a dealer pays the manufacturer for the car) 

If we could put a price on the car and the customer knew that is what they would pay, then we would be much happier. It really is just a leftover custom that we can't get rid of because it has become the expectation.

And the result of all this extra bonding is that the larger group, and hence the individuals within it, flourishes.""

Sex is lots of fun, but also has a way of making relationships and lives messy, especially centuries before birth control.

As such, a general rule to ""keep it in your pants until you are paired off in a stable family unit"" is a reasonably decent way to prevent a lot of problems. Unfortunately, over generations a reasonable bit of advice turns into a cultural taboo which broadens and pulls in nearby activities and eventually gets tangled up in the overal moral system. Suddenly ""we aren't good at cooking pigs without getting sick so stay away"" and ""sex in marriage is the best default"" starts to take on the same moral imperitive of ""don't stab people"" and ""stealing is bad"".... even centuries later when sex is safer and less avoidable and bacon doesn't kill people (except slowly).

3ofa1l,"How do insurances in the US work? How can you pay an insurance, but can still face a medical bill, how come insurance doesnt cover it? Also, what is the price for an usual insurance for an adult","Insurance offsets risk. If you have insurance, you replace an unknown cost that could strike at any moment with a known cost that you pay regularly. The insurance company takes on the burden of the risk, and of course charges you for the service.

The more risk the insurance company takes on, the more expensive insurance will be for you. Most people rarely have very big medical expenses (as with a major illness or accident), so these are actually not that expensive to insure against. But people very often have small medical expenses throughout the year for minor ailments. If you want to insure against these, too, your insurance will be quite expensive.

This means that you usually save money by insuring yourself against medical bills you couldn't possibly pay yourself, but not being covered by medical bills you can pay on your own.  In the United States, health plans are required to have an ""out of pocket maximum""--the maximum amount you can pay out of pocket in a year before your health insurance will cover the rest. By picking a high or low out of pocket maximum, you can cover just as much risk as you like. For example, if you make $60,000 a year, it probably makes sense for you to have an out-of-pocket limit of $6000 rather than $500, because the savings on your health insurance costs is immense and it is no great burden to have $6000 saved up in case you need it for medical bills.

The cost of insurance varies a lot. Private insurance can cost from $100 (little coverage) to $400 (lots of coverage) per person, per month. But it's important to note that very few people actually pay that much--the majority of Americans get health insurance as a benefit from their employer, either fully or partially paid. And if they don't, they can get a tax credit that will pay a portion of monthly premiums. Very low-income people qualify for Medicaid, which is public health insurance.",eli5

I've seen videos for years now about the Pachelbel's Canon in D and how so many pop songs fit that piece of music (mainly those two : _URL_0_ and _URL_1_ ). Do those tunes actually fit the music and why or it's some kind of trick on our brain?
Did the composers of last 20 years' songs really use it in all their songs?
I feel like so many songs actually fit this Canon in D, do the artists in those videos make some modifications to the songs to make them fit?
Or for example, what song would not fit this tune?","What's similar across the songs is the chord progression. So when the person in the Axis of Awesome video says all those songs are using the same 4 chords, he doesn't mean, for example, C chord, G chord, etc. The four chords he's talking about are I, V, vi, and IV. What does that mean? Well, if your song is in the key of C, then I is the C chord, V is the G chord, vi is the A minor, IV is F. But if your song is in a different key, those four chords are going to be different, just following the same pattern. So yes, they do have to modify the songs to make them fit, in that they're not all being sung in their original keys, their being shifted to the same key so they go together like that. Also, those chords are just making up the harmony of the song. The melodies, while they do have to match with that chord progression harmony to sound good, have a lot more room to be varied and creative between those songs.

The Canon in D video is illustrating a different chord progression:  I – V – vi – iii – IV – I – IV – V. So if you take any song from the first video and try to put it in the second, or vice versa, it won't go together as well.

Here are some other common chord progressions (including the two already mentioned): _URL_0_",eli5

3io1o9,How much of an effect does a forest fire have on the temperature in surrounding areas I realize this is really open ended on the size of the fire and how close the surrounding areas are. I spent a long time trying to come up with my own scenario but I think it'll be easier for someone who knows what they're talking about to just give an example in their explanation.,"TL;DR: A whole bunch in the short term, but not a whole lot in the longer term. 

Forest fires are for the most part the following chemical reaction: 

long-chain-sugar (that's an indigestible sugar molecule known as wood or material like dried leaves or pine needles) + oxygen  = carbon dioxide + water + heat.

The amount of heat this reaction gives off is quite a bit, but it's diluted by the amount of water that has to be removed too. Get close to a large dried-out pine tree that's burning and you can easily feel the thermal energy it gives off, get close to a campfire made from waterlogged wood, and not so much. But increase the amount of wood and highly volatile material like dried ground-cover pine needles, and you'll get a very warm localized temperature, possibly enough to cook you if there's a combination of enough burning mass and enough wind to feed it fresh oxygen (and intense fires create their own wind by heating air so it rises and more air flows along the ground to replace it!).

Over time, this heat will dissipate in the surrounding winds and move off to other areas. But generally it's noticeably warmer in a forest fire's immediate area as long as it's dry and there's fuel to burn.",eli5

2kh0jp,Why is the House of Commons so rowdy and unprofessional? ,"I expect you've seen a video of something called ""Prime Minister's Questions"", which is a half-hour session that runs in the HoC every Wednesday lunchtime.

The original idea of this session was to allow MPs (= elected representatives) to put questions directly to the Prime Minister.

The basic reasons were that the Russians were losing WW1, and that there was a lot of poverty and hunger. Also, the Czar was very unpopular because he taxed heavily and was very dictatorial.

1xtty2,"Why we NEED credit cards If all credit cards do is help you buy things that you do not have the money for with the hopes that you will be able to pay it off later...wouldn't it just make more sense to save the money in the first place and not have to pay interest?  

Also, couldn't your savings account history (hypothetically) be a reflection of your credit? ","Of course we don't *need* credit cards. Society would run without them. On the other hand, there are good reasons to have a credit card.

- For those people who have more than enough savings/cash-flow to make their purchases without credit, using a credit card may still make sense. If you pay off the balance within a month, you don't pay any interest charges. Thus, it's a 0%-interest short-term loan. This is useful because it lets you maximize your investing power (keeping your money in some sort of interest-bearing investment for as long as possible, choosing the right moment to sell a stock, etc.).
- For those people living paycheck-to-paycheck, a credit card allows them to purchase things immediately, rather than waiting for the next paycheck. Again, this can be done in a way where you never pay any interest, so it's a convenient way to control *when* you need to pay for your purchases.
- For those making purchases they cannot afford, credit cards can be very dangerous. Even so, there are times when this is justified (e.g. a sudden emergency).
- Credit cards also offer incentives: in particular convenience (swipe the card instead of carrying cash), rewards ('cash back', etc.) and some amount of protection (e.g. against fraud). So again, for people who never pay interest on their balances (pay them off quickly), credit cards have lots of advantages and can be a net win.

Those are some hypothetical good reasons for having a credit card. However, from a financial-planning perspective, if you are regularly paying interest on credit card purchases (or, worse, have your card 'maxed out'), then you are not doing yourself any favours. In those cases, you are better off cancelling your credit cards and instead saving up for each and every purchase.",eli5

3wyarv,"In its most sincere ELI5 form, what is dark matter, what does it affect and how do we know it exists if none of our senses pick it up?","Astronomers have been looking at the universe with telescopes for a long time. They have sized up stars and galaxies. By this I mean they know the sizes stars come in, and galaxies. They know their masses. By every rule they basically know the mass of the stars and galaxies they see even if they are very far away.

They see some very far away ones since galaxies are made of stars and stars are bright. Since they see them then they know their mass. This is important, mass determines how much they will pull each other if they are reasonably close as compared to how far away they can be seen.

Astronomers see clusters of galaxies in orbit around a common point. The problem is the light matter they see, the stars, is not enough to pull these galactic clusters together in orbits.

Astronomers are not going to throw out newtonian physics or the laws of gravity. So they must account for the orbiting they see. So they declare there is dark matter which they cannot see. It accounts for the galaxies in common orbits.

They know it exists. They see galaxies in orbit. They also know they do not see enough mass to account for the orbits. So they invented dark matter to account for what they see.",eli5

Basically, a guy gone boned on a storage lot auction.  Guy bought a vehicle at a storage lot auction.  What he didn't know was, *they gave him the wrong car*.  Meanwhile, owner of sold car keeps happily paying their lot fees believing their old car is safe and sound.  New ""owner"" plans on using parts from his wifes old, engine blown, car to fix up purchased car for her to drive.  Time goes by, he gives up on the project and goes to sell the car on craigslist.  Meanwhile, the original owner has since reported their vehicle stolen from the lot.  Coincidentally, the original owner browses craigslist and....sees his old car up for sale!  Calls the police and I respond.  That was a mess to sort through.

Basically, the new ""owner"" had to surrender the car to us to give back to the original owner at his expense.  After contacting the storage lot, they admitted it was definitely their fault and I imagine a bit of civil action took place after that.  

Criminal charges can be brought against someone if there is sufficient evidence that they knowingly purchased stolen property.

If the person unknowingly purchased stolen property, the property will still be siezed to return to the original owner, and hopefully, with criminal charges brought against the theif.  

As far as the unkowing purchaser goes, they are out the item/the money they paid for the item.  They may persue the theif in civil court for monetary damages in order to recoup their losses.",eli5

With the destruction bio-weapons cause, your country wins the war. But after, you are the one responsible for making the call, and the UN now brings charges against you. You take the fall for these actions and will face serious sentencing (look at leaders from nazi Germany, many faced extremely long sentences) and if things get bad enough, you risk facing executions.

6qdq1e,"why we associate radiation and radioactive materials with the colour green? In movies and games, especially fallout franchise I see nuclear waste as the colour green, are they actually green in real life?","Many uranium containing chemicals are either pale green or glow green when exposed to UV light. For example in the early 20th century, uranium was sometimes added to glass to make it a nice pale green colour. This type of glass would glow a strong green if exposed to blue or UV light.

Similarly, radioactive materials such as radium or tritium were used as an energy source to charge glow in the dark materials, such as zinc sulfide. Zinc sulfide would glow green in the dark after being charged by light, or if it was mixed with a radioactive material like radium. Paint made from a mixture of zinc sulfide and radium was often used for clocks and watches, so that you could read the clocks in the dark.

Radioactive materials tend not to glow in air - they have to be extremely radioactive to glow in air, but if they did, they would usually glow blue.

When highly radioactive materials are placed in water, they may glow due to ""Cherenkov radiation"" which is a pale blue. You can see an example in this video: _URL_0_

5chydb,Why bruises on our bodies come out in different colours ,"A bruise is just blood that has leaked out of the blood vessels and into the surrounding tissues. Initially when the blood leaks out a bruise is just the color of the blood, so it starts out as red.  

The color of blood comes from the substance, hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying the oxygen in the blood. As hemoglobin loses oxygen, it changes from red to blue.  Since the blood in a bruise has leaked out of the blood vessels, and no longer has the ability to circulate through the lungs, it does not receive new oxygen.  As the blood in the bruise loses its oxygen it changes from red to blue.

The red blood cells that are no longer in the circulatory system start to die and leak out the hemoglobin.  Without the protection of the blood cells, the hemoglobin starts to break down through a multi-step process.  First it is converted to a substance called biliverdin, which is green, giving the bruise a greenish appearance.  Next it is further broken down into bilirubin, which is yellow (same substance that causes jaundice in newborns.)  The body is able to then dispose of the bilirubin completely, so no more colors after yellow.

These processes are all happening at the same time, so it is a gradual progression from red > purple/blue > green > yellow.",eli5

Emulators have to accurately emulate these quirks or else the game itself could break or not work. It goes down to a point where developers manipulate where some data is stored in memory in order to exploit how the CPU caches or accesses specific memory addresses.

This could mean that newer hardware, despite being far more powerful, may need to do 20x as much work to accomplish the same result.",eli5
2yq16v,"Where did the term ""kidnap"" come from? Why is the term used for adults?

If I was taken by force illegally, I'd say they kidnapped me out of habit, but I'd feel weird because i'm not a kid..? so wouldn't it be abducted","After googling the etymology of the word there aren't many big surprises.  Often sited as the first written record of ""kidnap"" was in 1682 and referred to a kid being nabbed - a word meaning stolen still in use today (at least in the UK) and was in the context of a 13 year old abductee.  Someone else has said that at the time print was becoming more popular and there just weren't many words meaning abducted (this word itself seems to be a newer word than kidnap).

My guess is that the tabloids of the time thought the word was more easily understandable by the public even though it was originally associated with a child.

Another comment on the first hit on google says that kid could actually be a goat and it's in reference to stealing livestock.

So yeah they just started using it for everyone I think because the masses already knew what that word meant.

bxpyky,what's the difference between attraction and fetishism? and why is fetishism considered rude in some situations but not others? (think like the embracing of foot fetishes),"I'll be upfront about this. Having a fetish is not considered 'normal' by society and lots of people have a hard time comprehending that this sort of thing even exists let alone is far more common place than they could imagine.

A fetish is being attracted to a thing or an action to such a degree that you can't be turned out without it.

People with a fetish may have difficulty differentiating between being attracted to someone because of their appearance, or personality, etc or being attracted to them because they happen to be wearing something or performing an act that you fetishize.

This can lead to them being in relationships for the wrong reasons, and being taken advantage of.

Some people with fetishes have difficulty in relationships because of it. They can't be aroused without their fetish and their partner has to be aware of this and a willing participant and so the sex life can be difficult.

Some people are honestly creeped out by fetishes and discovering that a potential or existing partner is into this sort of thing can unfortunately result in disgust and generally bad reactions towards it.

The key thing of course is communication, discussing this sort of thing openly with a partner is healthy but since many people are closeted with regards to their fetish because of the taboo they can have a really hard time with this. Having a bad reaction to it can lead them to be even more closeted instead of embracing this part of themselves and exploring it in a healthy way.",eli5

2sqiww,"Why did Swiss Central Bank get rid of exchange rate gap, and why is it such a big deal? ","I run a factory in Switzerland, manufacturing components for aerospace, Formula 1, medical, and such. We employ about 100 people. Let me tell you why it's a big deal to me.

On Thursday I sat down and had a cup of coffee. One euro was worth 1.2 Swiss francs. As I started my second cup, there was a news alert about the Swiss franc. By the time I finished my second cup, one euro was worth less than a Swiss franc, and my factory was a dead man walking, and pretty much all of those 100 people are going to be unemployed by this time next year - because of a one decision by a banker.

Why? 

Our number one cost is labor - about 65% of our sales. All of our employees are paid in Swiss Francs. However, roughly 75% of our sales are in euros. So, in effect, my ability to cover my costs has dropped about 20% overnight. We were making around 15% profit. We went from ""nice healthy business"" to ""money loser"" in less time than it takes to watch an episode of Game of Thrones - and because of nothing we did. 

If you keep in mind I had spent the better part of the last decade struggling to scratch us up to the 15% number, clawing out every efficiency I could find, that should help you understand why I can't simply hack out another 20% of cost and go on. Also, my customers will not generally have that much money available to give us as a price hike. There is a lot of work to do, but the long and short of it is that we are no longer profitable. And my job went from building the business to dismantling it overnight. 

Why did this happen? In order to keep business like mine afloat, which provide around 25% of the jobs in Switzerland, the Swiss National Bank for years had determined that they would never let the Swiss Franc appreciate to being less than 1.2 CHF to the euro - because the effect of a strengthening franc was going to be hard on industry for the reasons above. So they adopted a strategy similar to China's with respect to the dollar - print a lot of their own currency to buy debts denominated in the target currency to keep your own weak, and your goods competitive. While the SNB can simply snap their fingers and create more francs any time they want, you can't do that forever without seriously distorting the economy. In the last few months, the collapse in value of Russia's currency has caused a lot of their money to flow into Switzerland, looking for a more stable haven. Combined with the european money that was flowing in away from the eurozone (who was engaging in a similar strategy of deliberate inflation) the SNB realized that their ability to hold the cap was not going to be able to overcome the pressure of two large economic zones shipping their money in. So, rather than bankrupt themselves, and potentially causing massive damage to the Swiss economy, they chose to stop the cap, and permit very serious damage to the Swiss economy instead. 

The problem was that since the SNB was guaranteeing a certain exchange rate, a lot of hedge funds and currency investors were relying on that, by betting on the exchange rate to rise (that is, the CHF to fall) since the SNB had their thumb on the scale and was preventing the opposite case. So many, many outside investors were highly exposed to the risk of an appreciating Swiss Franc. The shocking announcement caught them all with their pants down, and a lot of funds got burned. This is the global impact.

EDIT: A few notes to some recurring comments, since this comment has been gilded (thank you, whomever you are):

There are a lot of ""Why don't you just..."" 

* ""...cut everyone's pay?"" ""...pay them in euros?"" and various other iterations on reducing payroll costs.

I can't do it unilaterally - I am prevented from this. I have to meet with the works council - in effect, the union. If they agree to it, I can do pretty much anything, and I am, of course, meeting with them to discuss this. The likely result is going to be negative, because everyone's obligations are still largely in CHF. Rents/mortgages, car loans, health insurance, etc. Their food bill can potentially go down if they are willing to border hop (while practical, since we are close to the German border, and all of the stores along the border routinely have parking lots filled with Swiss cars) but that is not exactly something I can mandate. So, while of course I am going to push for this, I don't see them accepting. Not to mention that if the currency continues to float upwards, we have go back to this well again. Paying them in euros is absolutely toxic in Switzerland. In general, the works council is a pretty good business partner, and they try to help, but they also will not possibly absorb all of it. 

* ""...raise your prices?"" 

We will. I did a lot of this in 2011 right up until the cap was first implemented, and it is an uphill climb. There are quite a few of contracts that have currency clauses that let us raise the prices automatically, which helps. There is some amount of customers that will take this because they have no choice, but their prices were gold-plated to begin with. My customers that do have a choice will exercise it, likely whether or not I try to raise the price because they will (rightly) see me as an unstable vendor. Then we hit a critical mass issue. While a lot of parts have contracted prices already, I've broken plenty of these contracts before, so that isn't quite the obstacle you might imagine.

* ""...hedge?""

We do. We are limited in how much hedge we can take out because of the covenants between our (American) parent company and their bank. After 2008, a lot of these got put in place to limit exposure to prevent another AIG-style collapse. So we have always kept hedges exactly at the max allowed, and used a favourable currency calculation to cheat a bit. The effect is that we can stabilise roughly one quarter's worth of our A/R. But if we take a hedge, all that does is buy us time, it doesn't change the underlying reality. The other fact of the hedge is that yes, in this instance, it would have been a huge win. But the bank would have pointed out that had the CHF moved the other way, it would have been an enormous loss. And they did not want us speculating on currency. In hindsight of recent events, the correct decision would have been to hedge to Pluto. But we didn't have that data then, and that was the parameters we were given. Ultimately, I don't think the bank was being unreasonable. Had the currency done a slower appreciation as it did in the 2011 crisis, the impact wouldn't have been so severe, and we could have tried to argue the case on hedging. I think the SNB underestimated how big the jump would be. 

At the end of the day, the financial engineering would help, it would buy us time, but it doesn't change the reality of what has happened. 

In general - any solution that includes the word ""just"" usually isn't as nice as it seems. We have a lot of brains on this, not just mine. And believe me - it would be much better for the whole company for my unit to be stable and profitable, and that is what everyone wants. We're motivated, and we have a lot of resources to draw from. Life just sucks sometimes.

People don't give up Pasta, they just seem to be giving up bread? It's so god damn good as well!","It depends on which theory you subscribe to. A foundation of the paleo diet, for example, is that grain has not been present in human development long enough for us to be able to digest it effectively, and therefore should not be eaten. This would include bread, pasta and other grains. 

Carbs have really been in focus the past few years as different diets and studies have come forward showing that low-carb diets lead to weight loss. Many people are confused as to what a carb actually is, and interpret this as ""bread is the devil!"" without realizing that pasta, fruit, potatoes, etc. are all carbs as well. 

Remember the fat-free craze of the 90s? EVERYTHING became low-fat or fat-free, and in most cases removing fat added carbs.  Lo and behold, we are fatter than ever. Many nutritionists are starting to rethink low-fat diets, and our belief that fat is the enemy. Sweden, for example, has recently started recommending a high-fat, low-carb diet. 

Human nutrition is incredibly complex. Your friends are likely misunderstanding this information, are probably confused as to what a carb is, and are giving up bread thinking they are maybe making a difference in their health.  Or, they REALLY love bread and are demonstrating the sacrifice of lent by giving up something they truly love.

ck8cze,Why do muscles stiffen and lose flexibility? And why does stretching sometimes feel good and sometimes hurt? ,"Lots and lots of reasons.  But ELI5.  Muscles get stiff because they get used to being short and all the fibres get tighter and closer together.  It can also be because of literal knots in the muscle.

Thanks to healing and massage those cuts can be healed to normal.

During this ""brain defrag"" we are getting rid of crap it doesn't need (why dreams can be so nonsensical).

Wouldn't female babies be, for lack of a better term, more valuable once they grow up?","There are many reasons, but it's not near as prolific as it was 30 years ago. For example, it's illegal for a doctor to tell the parents if it's a boy or girl before it's delivered (to avoid abortions when baby is found out to be a girl)

But what currently happens now is with the 1 child policy, if you have a girl first, (in some cities) you're allowed to have another child to try and have a boy. In some cases, I personally met a girl who said she was the 2nd daughter, and she was given up to our aunt so her parents could try a 3rd time to get a boy. Apparently this is also very common in rural areas. 

I think it's going to cause a lot of problems in the future, not only the male to female ration, but other social issues such as ""little emperor syndrome"", the child is an only child, with 2 parents, and 4 grand parents and is spoiled rotten all the way through their younger years. I work in manufacturing in southern China and I see a lot of younger generation (18-25) who are extremely lazy, especially the boys. The girls tend to work harder, so in the factories I've been working at you can see the work force is 70-75% female.

Is there an exact reason for this? Is it because pain is a relatively ""new"" concept for children? Do we just get used to the pain over the years?","When you first scrape your knee, it’s the worst pain you’ve ever been in and you react accordingly.

6zsi5k,"What causes stuttering and can you out grow it? Ive just seen just the movie It and I am wondering what causes a person to stutter? Is there something in the brain that causes it? 

I am also wondering if its something people can kind of grow out of? I had a childhood friend who stuttered a lot when we were young, but now that were both adults he doesnt stutter anymore. 

also, I did search it first and I dont feel like there were very good answers. ","There's no one explanation.  Sometimes it's just bad habits that take root during speech development, similar to other impediments.  Renowned English scientist Michael Faraday actually cured himself of his speech impediment by watching his sister speak in a very exaggerated and pronounced way, then mimicking her mouth movements.

Movies and TV love the reason that falls on the less innocent end of the spectrum: abuse.  It tells a good story after all, and 'outgrowing' your stuttering problem makes for a touching metaphor for overcoming abuse.

3hnhwo,"Why do need to be taught to lift with our legs and not our back? Is lifting with our back a learned behaviour that we need to unlearn? Searching came up with [this topic](_URL_0_), which raises more questions. Namely:

1) It's suggested that by looking at toddlers it's fair to  say that squatting to pick objects up is a natural inclination. Others suggest that this is a bad example due to the fact that adult proportions would make bending over to pick something up easier while toddler proportions would make balance difficult. Which doesn't really clear anything up

2) People suggest that the reason lifting with your back is bad is most people don't often lift heavy objects with their back so when they do they throw it out... which seems to ignore that this still suggests our leg muscles are naturally more capable for this than our back because if our undertrained back can't do it but our undertrained legs can, it still suggests our back is shit at the job and doesn't help explain why we need to be taught to use our legs.

3) Someone posts a link about how people in ""the third-world"" (which is super vague) will squat when they hang out instead of sitting  and posits that this behaviour might help in a gym setting. This doesn't help entirely because it doesn't really get into if we could expect to see people lifting with their back commonly in cultures that don't use chairs often/at all (and the ELI5 topic isn't phrased to be about lifting, though that's implied).

So, is someone able to clear this up?","Upright standing is a very recent condition for humans on an evolutionary timescale. Our spine isn't that much different from our primate ancestors, who had horizontal backs, and therefore adapted to carry weight in a very different way. This is the root cause of most of our back problems. However, our instincts haven't changed much since then either. Bending over to pick something up feels natural because that's basically the position our ancestors were in all the time..",eli5

Then, if we can advance the world by having robots take up our jobs, we would be living in a better world.

This is a big issue with modern cars and not on older ones because of aerodynamics. To get an aerodynamically slick car you want the moving layer of air to be smoothly attached to the car body. Disrupt that flow with an open window and you generate the vortexes.

Older cars wouldn't get this effect for a couple of reasons. First, the bodies were blocky enough and had enough nooks and crannies all over them that the boundary layer of air was already turbulent. Any open window would just get a chaotic rush of air. Second, those older cars were not very well sealed, so any resonance that *did* happen would be vented by the poorly sealed doors and other windows.",eli5

3pfs2y,"Why is drinking alcohol during pregnancy so taboo? Recently there have been several studies coming out with conflicting results on what amount of alcohol is acceptable during pregnancy. The recommendation from the surgeon general is that women consume zero drinks during pregnancy. However, there have been studies that have suggested that small amounts of alcohol are not as detrimental as once thought, and there may be very little, if any difference between mothers who don't drink, and those who drink sparingly during pregnancy.

I understand that almost all mothers do not want their child to have fetal alcohol syndrome. At the same time, among alcoholics, fetal alcohol syndrome only occurs 30% of the time. It takes about 4 drinks a day to cause it. If consuming alcohol in the slightest was so detrimental during pregnancy, why wasn't everyone alive back in the middle ages, when water was dangerous to drink, a fetal alcohol baby?

My main questions are: Why has this topic become so taboo? Why is the government recommending what it is recommending? Why has it become so difficult to talk about without someone who suggests that it might be ok to drink sparingly getting demonized as an unfit parent?

Disclaimer: I am not pregnant nor am I trying to become pregnant. I am just curious.








","The other thing is, a safe dosage cannot be assessed in a controlled drug trial because no one is going to subject pregnant women to a test of alcohol vs. toxicity.

1ha2u3,"Why using space in usernames is not allowed? No matter if Reddit, video games, or whatever. Space between characters seems to be the worst thing ever. Why is that?","Computers and servers don't like spaces, it confuses them. There's a bunch of reasons, most having to do with how the computer reads names in.

The simplest reason is that spaces are often used as a delimiter. What that means is that a space often denotes a separation between two commands, just like a space separates two words when you write. Let's imagine that I'm telling the computer to run a program which I unwisely named ""foo bar.exe."" The simple command that the computer ""reads"" might be something like

run foo bar.exe

This will create problems. The computer reads ""run,"" ""foo,"" and then ""bar.exe,"" and doesn't know what to do. It understood ""run,"" but it doesn't know what ""foo"" means, and ""bar.exe"" doesn't exist. There's a couple ways to fix this, of course; I could change my operating system so that

run!foo bar.exe

is the command, where ""!"" is acting as the delimiter instead of space. That's perfectly fine, but it's very natural to humans (who ultimately have to write this code) to use spaces as the delimiter, because we already use space as a delimiter in normal speech. I could also do

run foo_bar.exe

which executes just fine.

Now, you can get around this in a lot of ways. You may have noticed, for example, that Windows will let you put spaces in file names (though you couldn't back in the good ol' days), and it works just fine. What they usually do is change the internal name of the file so that it still works, i.e. you name it ""foo bar.exe"" and its name appears to you as ""foo bar.exe,"" but it's actually secretly called ""foo%20bar.exe"" so that the computer knows what to do with it. That's all well and good, and it's a perfectly acceptable solution, but it creates overhead, and can cause other problems, so it's easier to just not let people use spaces at all.",eli5

Beyond that, many of the plants we *do* want, we are growing outside of their natural environment. We choose them for ornamentation, not suitability.

kb31k,"Why is Palestine seeking statehood through the UN such a bad idea? This isn't a troll; I seriously don't understand the objections. Maybe I've got hive-mind-itis, but it seems like seeking statehood through the UN is exactly what all the critics of Palestine's past behavior (except Israel, which will probably never like the idea) should want. So why are some world leaders and political commentators treating the idea as if any five-year-old (cough) should see its flaws? What is their reasoning? What are the possible consequences?","I'd be happy to answer this, though I don't actually think their UN campaign is a poor idea. I do know what the general argument is against the UN statehood push.

First, the Palestinian push for statehood in the eyes of the UN would simply create two states (Israel and Palestine), rather than a two-state solution where both sides (Israelis and Palestinians) acknowledge, agree, and have a clear understanding of where the borders between both states are, what responsibilities both sides have to maintain peace between the two states, and what the relationship between Israel and Palestine is.

The UN voting and declaring Palestine a state, either without an acknowledgement of where the borders of that state are, or voting that Palestine will be defined by the 1967 borders - that is, all of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip - would not necessarily force the Israeli Defense Forces to move their army from the West Bank or relocate roughly 500,000 Israeli settlers from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The UN declaration of Palestinian statehood would simply be a diplomatic victory for the Palestinian Liberation Organization (the representative body of Palestinians for all Palestinians everywhere - legally speaking) and would not bring about any immediate changes on the ground. The Palestinians would have a state with no sovereignty, in short. To achieve that sovereignty the Palestinians would either have to take the land and set out their borders by force,  by continued diplomatic maneuvering at the UN, or via negotiations with the Israeli government.

Second, the Palestinians do not have one consensus government that represents Palestinians living in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Hamas controls the Gaza Strip and Fateh controls the West Bank. Fateh is a member of the PLO, but Hamas is not, so this push at the UN is mainly the push of an organization dominated by one major Palestinian political party. If statehood was granted it would not be anywhere near immediately clear who exactly was the government of Palestine. Reconciliation between the two major Palestinian factions would create a consensus government, but as of right now, practically speaking, there are two Palestinian statelets run by different factions in different parts of historic Palestine that are not geographically connected.

Furthermore, there is also a concern floating around in the Palestinian community that if the PLO is granted statehood for Palestine the Palestinian refugees living in places like Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and a bevy of other countries would lose their virtual representation in the UN, because the PLO would cease to exist as a body before the UN. The Palestinian state and it's government would have representation in the UN and only Palestinian citizens of Palestine would be represented by that body.

Finally, the Palestinian's push for statehood at the UN goes contrary to what the United States and the Middle East Quartet (the US, Russia, UN, and EU - a body set out to promote peace via negotiations between the two sides). Members of the US Congress and the State Department have threatened to cut funding to the Palestinians should they continue their statehood campaign at the UN. The Palestinian government does not have a steady revenue to keep up operations without outside funding and US funding has been a substantial part of that funding for the better part of a decade.",eli5

2ni24t,Why is it not racist to have all black organizations? ,"This can be a very volatile topic, with lots of points of view.  This is mine, so take it for what it's worth.

Black organizations exist to provide services that are available in non-segregated organizations, but which blacks have difficulty in accessing because bias has caused these services to be provided to those in the majority (i.e., whites) out of proportion to the majority's population.  One way of providing services to the underserved minority is to have organizations which limit their services to only the minority.

For example, let's assume a university has a population composed of 70% purple students and 30% green students.  However, the non-segregated fraternities on campus have a membership population composed of 90% purple and 10% green.  The assumption is that this difference is due to some bias in the process of becoming a member that favors purple over green students.  To fix this bias, one could enforce any number of policies.  For example, an offer of membership must be given to 3 green students for every 7 offers to purple students.  Maybe everyone in the fraternities must attend training that explains why there shouldn't be any differences between purple and green students.  Maybe green students should be given preference over purple students when all other criteria are equal.  Lastly, fraternities could be created that allow only green students in so that the opportunities for greens to join fraternities is greater than the opportunity for purples, which balances out the disproportionate membership selection.  Perhaps a combination of these policies will achieve the desired result.

Another factor that enters into the mix is that of meeting the unique needs of the minority population.  The thinking behind this is that minority populations have issues that are not faced by majority populations because they are the minority.  For example, in our Mardi Gras university, maybe being green has been associated with very high academic performance.  Until recently, most people thought, ""Let the greens solve the hard science  problems, that's what they do.""  A fraternity that has historically been composed of members of the purple majority is not likely to be able to offer good advice to green students on handling the pressures of these expectations.  However, a greens only fraternity would, in theory, consist of people who understand and can advise others because of personal experience.",eli5

4namsc,"Why does vectorized code run faster than looped code? I've been doing more programming lately, and I learned that running vectorized code and computing calculations on arrays all at once is faster than using a ""for"" loop, for example. Why is this the case? What does the computer do to change arrays all at once that is so much faster than going iteratively?","Cooking instructions are a common analogy for computer algorithms - so let's consider one.

You're making a giant salad with 12 eggs. The cooking instructions state:

 >  1. Take an egg.
 >  2. Slice the egg.
 >  3. Repeat from 1 until all eggs are sliced.

This seems like a logical way of going through egg slicing for someone who is doing it by hand. However since you own an [egg slicer](_URL_1_) that is able to slice three eggs at the same time, it would be more efficient for you, if you could use that instead. Unfortunately it doesn't fit with the algorithm.

However, if the cooking instruction were written as:

 >  1. Slice the eggs

Now you are free to decide yourself what is the most efficient way to go about achieving this result. You can use your multi-egg slicer while someone who owns a large knife can slice two eggs at a time.

------------------------------

The example with eggs and special tools for handling the task is surprisingly close to programming. When you use a compiler to compile code into an executable, the compiler must decide what instruction set it targets. The instruction set specifies the available operations it can execute on the CPU. For modern computers the lowest common instruction set is the x86 instruction set and thus it would be the safest bet if all you are interested in is compatibility with other computers.

The problem with x86 is that it doesn't contain the ""Slice eggs"" instruction - it only contains the singular ""Slice egg"" instruction. So a compiler that targets x86 instruction set must use the first version of the cooking algorithm where it loads each egg from the memory to the CPU and divides them one by one.

At some point engineers figured out that a lot of people are slicing a lot of eggs and decided that the CPU should be able to do this faster and created instruction set extensions, such as SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, MMX, etc.. These contain so called [Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)](_URL_0_) instructions. A compiler able to target SSE for example could translate the ""Slice the eggs"" instruction into:

 >  1. Load 4 eggs from the memory to CPU
 >  2. Divide the 4 eggs
 >  3. Repeat from 1 until all eggs are sliced

This isn't limited to only the things your CPU can do on its own either. In real life your CPU doesn't know how to ""slice eggs"", instead you'd be likely to use a cooking library that can slice various things for this. Now the cooking library might come in different versions: One suitable for various tools in their kitchen and one that doesn't rely on any kitchen tools. As long as you can tell it to ""slice eggs"", the cooking library is free to use whichever algorithm it deems best to implement the task. If you were to use a for-loop and tell it to slice each egg separately, then it would be a lot harder for the library to choose the most efficient way to accomplish the task.

--------------------------

2zsuoc,"why do most cold liquids taste better than warm liquids? Eg. cold water vs. warm water, cold beer vs. lukewarm beer","They don't.

The temperature of food or drink affects how volatile certain chemicals in it are, and thus the relative intensity of the flavor of them.

When something's cold, it takes a lot stronger of a flavor to be able to be tasted.

If you're drinking beer that must be cold to taste okay, then it's bad tasting beer - because the flavor of it is bad, and it requires coldness in order to be palatable.

There are beers that are brewed to be drunk warm, and the flavor of them is a lot more difficult to get right because the person drinking it can actually taste them.

This holds true for cold vs. warm water - you can taste some impurities in the water more when its warm than you can when its cold.

That's also why, for example, ice cream has a hell of a lot of sugar in it - because in order for it to taste sweet at the cold temperature there needs to be a lot more sweetness in it.",eli5

804nrc,"Why do lenders use your gross income. rather than your net income, on debt to income ratio?","It is usually the most stable way to determine the debt to income ratio (barring those who make a living off of tips). The lender does not care how much you pay in taxes, insurance etc.  The net can be changed at anytime to add or subtract dependents from your taxes paid out in your checks. Some people purposely overpay taxes so they get a huge return at tax time (they treat it like a savings they can’t touch all year) and there are some who pay no taxes all year and will pay the entire year’s taxes at tax time.  So many variables in net income so they just use gross income. But truthfully when figuring out what you can afford use your net income in the debt to income ratio.

During the game, the officials’ all-white uniforms were mistaken for Arizona’s all-white uniforms. So, Olds worked with his friend George Moe, who operated a sporting goods store, to develop a black-and-white striped shirt to avoid confusion on the field. Olds debuted the shirt at a high school basketball tournament in Detroit in 1921, and the uniform caught on with other referees.

Sitting down without perfect posture results obviously in slouching. Your hamstrings are connected to your glutes and to your knees; when you sit down, you glutes are pulled toward tour knees (also bad for your lumbar spine  because of erosion). Your body is what you do. It's become a learned movement, aka, you've got super tight hamstrings. 

Surgeons can manipulate limbs of their patients while the patients are unconscious with ease in all directions, but once the person wake up, the nervous system ""locks out"". In order for the nervous system to protect the body, it will restrict the movement into more familiar positions. 

So when I say you have super tight hamstrings, it's just an easier way of saying that your nervous system is restricting full range of motion of your hamstrings in order to protect you. Now you need to familiarize your nervous system with the movement. do static and dynamic stretches often, and try to avoid pro-longed sitting. Maybe get up and walk around every half hour. Sit in squats for periods of time.",eli5

2uiwev,Why different animals have different lifespans? I just looked up the average lifespan of a spider (1.5 to 2 years) and I also heard that sharks live for centuries. I was just curious as to why there is such a huge gap.,"There's a concept called the ""Hayflick limit"", which basically says, a cell can only divide so many times before it loses the ability to. They believe it occurs on the DNA level, a piece is lost each replication, and when enough has been lost, the cell can't reproduce again.

All living creatures are constantly breaking down, and repairing themselves with new cells. When they can't fix the broken parts, they begin to fail, and death is on the way.

The rate the break down/repair happens, and the amount of times a cell can be replaced, varies by animal, resulting in drastically different lifespans.

It's worth mentioning, that in nature, animals (including humans) rarely live to this point. Predators, accidents, sickness, and excessive wear and tear (teeth worn to the point they can't eat, for instance) are generally what causes death. Dying of ""old age"" requires a very safe environment.",eli5

8kbux4,"Why do computers/processors get faster while their speed (GHz) stays the same? Hey wo i was wondering because the intel core 2  duo quad processors already got speeds up to 3 ghz per core. And I. The last 10 years it looked like the numbers stayed the same between 3-4 ghz per core.

So how did computers got faster while the number of processing cores and speed(Ghz) stayed relatively the same?","There's not only clockspeeds. The biggest improvements besides more cores are the numbers of instructions processed. This is called the IPC (instructions per cycle). 

Think of it like when you're coming home from grocery shopping with a car loaded with groceries. Clockspeed determines how long it takes you to carry things from your car to your fridge. IPC determines how many groceries you can carry in one trip. So a 3,4GHz CPU from 2008 might also need 30seconds from the car to the fridge, but it can only carry the bread and eggs while a 2018 CPU can carry the bread, eggs, bacon and soda at the same time. 

Additionally newer CPUs have more cores. So you're not carrying the groceries alone but got your brothers and sisters helping you. So instead of you doing 4 trips from the car to the fridge and back, you and your 3 siblings carry the stuff simultaneously so you only have to take one trip.

Additionally you can save time if you carry the groceries to the fridge in the order they should be put in it so you don't have to reorganize everything in the kitchen. So you gotta anticipate the correct order. Modern CPUs got much better at predicting what's going to be next.

All in all, this boosts overall performance. That being said, compared to the development in storage and graphics processing, the innovation of CPUs has slowed down a lot in the past years.",eli5

15zad8,why does water put out fire? ,"Two reasons combine to cause water to put out fire. First, water doesn't burn. In fact, water is one of the things that is *created* when something else burns, so water burning would be going backwards. Second, water can absorb a lot of heat for its weight. In other words, you have to put a lot more energy into water to raise its temperature, especially when it's going from liquid to steam (which happens between room temperature and the temperature of most fires). 

So when water is put on a fire, first it can't contribute any more energy (by burning) and second it sucks up a lot of the heat from the fire without going up in temperature, so eventually the fire gets too cold to keep going.",eli5

3bjmmb,"How did the US get out of recession? I was only in high school at the time and never really understood finance (still don't really get it to this day), so I never was able to learn what the United States did to break themselves out of it.","Massive government injection of money into the economy definitely played a role, in the form of bailouts and stimulus packages. The goal of getting out of recession is to restore confidence in the economy ie confidence in the future and the profitability of financial transactions. When the government came in and made many big banks solvent again it helped a lot. 

Funnily enough people have been bailing out banks during market crashes for a long time. Emperor Tiberius did it in Ancient Rome. And I'm sure that back then, just like today, people bitched and moaned about the government helping the big guy get bigger and richer, but it's an ancient and tested recovery method. 

For more history:

 >  Tiberius finally met the crisis by suspending the land-investment act and distributing 100,000,000 sesterces to the banks, to be lent without interest for three years on the security of realty. Private lenders were thereby constrained to lower their interest rates, **money came out of hiding, and confidence slowly returned.**

27gt1n,"If planet Earth's orbit around the sun is elliptic, and Earth itself isn't a perfect sphere, why doesn't it just drift into the sun ? I'm aware of the gravity equation ( GMm/r^2 ) and ""been told"" by my high-school teachers that every object in the universe are applying forces to other objects, but I still can't understand this kind of movement. I searched a bit, but none of the questions were taking the factor of having a elliptic orbit. I think that's pretty important.","Having an elliptic orbit is only important insofar as that's the only orbit that's actually an orbit. Hyperbolic orbits eject the orbiting body out of orbit; parabolic orbits lead to the object crashing into what it's orbiting; and circular orbits are just special cases of elliptical orbits that are essentially impossible to ever achieve. The only orbit you can have is an elliptical orbit, so there's no point making a fuss about it.

The gravity equation works just fine for elliptical orbits, it just has a changing r value.

The shape of the orbiting body has absolutely no affect on its orbit because there's no wind resistance in space. And in orbital mechanics, all forces are said to be acting on the centre of mass of the object, which is a single point, making the shape irrelevant except for determining where the centre of mass is located.",eli5

","For good or bad, most jurisdictions in the US give officers the ability to use quite a bit of force if they have a reason to believe that their lives or the lives of bystanders are in immediate danger.

Even if video evidence shows that there was no imminent danger, the officer's testimony that they *believed* themselves to be in danger (possible weapon, verbal threat, etc)can be enough to justify it, according to those rules.  So even if the video shows that a perpetrator didn't have a gun, the cop saying ""He reached into his pocket, like he was grabbing a gun"" could be enough to protect him, in many cases.

6vdstk,How do traffic lights work? How are they coordinated with each other and why do some lights stay on for longer when there are more cars? ,"Most lights operate on a simple timer.  They know to change every X seconds.  The 4 lights at an intersection are controlled by 1 control computer (and wired below ground) so there are never any accidents of green in both directions. 

The timing of this computer is set by a traffic engineer who works for your local city.  If you live in a really small town, this job is likely done by someone else but in larger cities, they hire people whose only job is to maximise the flow of traffic.

To that end, some lights have more features.  Such as the ability to change the timing of the light based on the time of day.  For example, give a longer green to people leaving the city at the end of the working day, but in the middle of the day keep it 50/50.  Or a light that has a dedicated left turn only green that can be activated or deactivated depending on rush hour timing. 

Even more advanced are lights that are connected to sensors under the roadway.  These lights can actually decent when there's traffic backing up and change the timing of their greens. Again the parameters of these lights are programmed by traffic control people. 

Lastly, and most advanced are lights that all connect to a network and feed live data back to a control center.  This is super uncommon but might happen in a place like New York where traffic i almost always trouble and lights need constant monitoring depending on conditions.  This kind of system is very uncommon and expensive to operate but useful for those narrow use cases where it makes economic sense.",eli5

When the Fed decides it wants more money in the economy, it buys debt from people (well, private banks) for dollars (which it poofs from nowhere; that's the fed's responsibility). When the fed decides the economy is growing too quickly and it needs to slow it down, we need less money in the economy, it sells debt.

If the final story doesn't include the question, but should include the quote, it's will be unclear, so they'll replace that pronoun and use brackets to indicate the paper changed the speakers words so the reader could understand the quote we used.

zaurj,"What happens if I buy stock of a company I'm asking because I understand that if it raises then I win money if it goes down I lose but based on what? The price I bought in? And if I lose, do I have to pay extra? If I win, I can cash out anytime?","If you buy a share in a company, you own a very small part of the whole company. You buy it from someone who wants to sell it, and they let you have it for a certain price. Let's say you paid $10 for your share. Congrats.

If the company does well, lots of other people will want to buy shares of them too. Since there's lots of people competing to buy, this makes the price go up. If the company isn't doing well, and there are very few people trying to buy, the price will go down. The price goes down until someone is willing to buy.

So lets say the company is doing great and people are willing to pay $13 for a share. If you agree to sell your share, you've made $3 (the difference between what you bought it for and what you sold it for). If the company did badly and you sell for $7, you've lost $3.

Why would you sell if you knew you were going to lose money? Well, if you know the company is going to continue to suck, it's better to sell at $7 than at $5 or less.

As for when you can 'cash in or out'... for a company that is bought and sold a lot, basically yes. As soon as you sell or buy, there will be someone there who wants to buy or sell. But in actuality you can only sell if someone actually wants to buy and vice versa. If you have a really small company that not many people know about, it can be hard to buy or sell shares on short notice.

And for the record... you don't actually make (or lose) money until you sell your stock. Until then, you have what's called a paper loss or paper gain.

It's also worth noting that the stock market can be a hell of a lot more complicated than that. If you're buying a stock though, the most you can ever lose is what you paid for it in the first place.",eli5

23f70w,"Why were nintendo 64 and ps1 games' graphics blocky and how were they able to make gamecube and beyond games less blocky? Like pretty  much everything in nintendo 64 games is a bunch of blocky jagged polygons and geometric shapes, why were they that way and what prevented them from making the graphics less blocky? Also, how did they change the graphics in next generation games to not be so blocky and jagged/rough looking? I mean in some early next gen games you can still kind of see the blockiness in more poorly rendered parts of the games afaik.

I dont get the progression either, how do we go from sprites that aren't blocky, to jagged polygons, to no jaggedness?

What prompted the design switch to jagged polygons too and made that graphics type so popular compared to just better looking sprites?","Limited processing power and memory kept programmers from adding as much detail as they would like. 

Two factors can cause jaggedness, low resolution, and low polygon count. 

When a you want a computer to process a 3d area, it has to check every polygon and pixel with some sort of math to determine things like color and location and stuff. 

More polygons and pixels = more math, which means it takes more computing speed to handle all the math. So they used less, which is why everything looked much poorer. 

As newer consoles with much more powerful processors came out, they were able to handle more math, which meant more polygons and pixels to hide edges and smooth things out. 

There is actually still jaggedness in games nowadays, its just much harder to spot(try taking a screenshot and zooming WAYYYYYY in). There are also algorithms that can smooth out the transitions from one edge to another. Those too take more math and processing power.

3wbxur,"Why, in film, Ancient Romans (and often Ancient Greeks) are almost always portrayed as being pale white guys with English accents, and have been for decades?","No, the Romans wouldn't have ""olive skin and black hair"".  You're thinking of Italian-Americans, whose grandparents disproportionately came Sicily, the poorest, most agricultural region of Italy... and also a region that was exposed to Arabic raids, invasions, and conquests from 650 AD and was only reconquered by Christians in 1060 AD.

Anyway, to answer your question about accents... at the time of the first ""talkies"", standard national accents weren't so well established as they are today.  Most Americans would speak with an instantly recognizable regional accent.  Think JFK's New England accent, Richard Feynman's New York accent, Faulkner's Southern accent.  (The situation was broadly similar in Britain, although I can't name the major accents that well.) Most actors would have grown up speaking in a way that was instantly recognizable as the speech of a particular place - just like it would be weird to have Al Jolson sing minstrel songs in a Yiddish accent.  And even the accent we now instantly accept as ""standard"" might have sounded pretty Midwestern.  The solution movie studios had to this problem was to teach many of the stars to speak in an accent that resembled a number of accents but wasn't actually the same as any... called the ""Mid-Atlantic"" accent because it is half British, half American.  That way it never seemed exactly wrong, no matter who they were supposed to be playing.

Over time they stopped teaching the ""Mid Atlantic"" accent because actors got into learning a new accent for every single role, if the part called for it.  But it persisted in big historical epics, whether set in medieval England, colonial America, or the ancient world, because it was accepted that it would be weird to have people speaking in anachronistic accents, so it would be better to give them the timeless, placeless accent.  It was also used for the strange Hollywood convention of English-speaking foreigners, à la the Von Trapp family.  But as American speech became more and more standardized, these intermediate accents didn't really sound unplaceable to Americans, they just sounded *British*.  So the convention became that when you hear actors speaking with a British-sounding accent for no clear reason, we know we've moved to a different time and place.",eli5

47lujv,"Why do so many English words that start with ""s"" start with ""es"" in Spanish? Pretty self explanatory, a lot of cognates have an English word starting with ""s"" while the Spanish word has an ""e"" before it. Some examples that come to mind are:

Station- estación

Stress- estrés

Stupid- estupido

Skis- esquís

There are a lot more. Is there a linguistic reason for this?","You'll note that this is really only true of English  >  Spanish words that start with ""s + consonant"". The reason this is true is explained [here](_URL_0_).

 >  The simplest syllable type is just a consonant (C) and a vowel (V), written as CV. Every language allows this type of syllable, but some languages, like Hawaiian don’t allow anything more complex than that, ever. This is why you get phrases like “Merry Christmas” borrowed into Hawaiian as Mele Kalikimaka.

 >  Other languages, like Japanese, allow a maximal syllable of CVN, where N stands for a nasal sound, as in Nihon (CV-CVN), but for an English loanword like “picnic”, you need to insert vowels again: pikunikku.

 > Many languages, including Spanish, allow up to two consonants before the vowel, as long as the first consonant is a stop or maybe a fricative (/p, t, k, b, d, g, f/) and the second one is a liquid or a glide (i.e. /l, r, j, w/). The maximal Spanish syllable is CCVC, which is why you can have words like playa “beach” _URL_2_, fresa “strawberry” _URL_2_, tres “three” CCVC, and duerme /_URL_1_ “sleeps” _URL_3_.  

 >  English allows for up to three consonants before the vowel (nucleus) of a syllable. When there are three, the first has to be /s/, the second has to be a voiceless stop, and the third has to be a liquid or glide. When there are two consonants, either the first can be /s/ and the second a stop, or the first can be a stop or fricative and the second a liquid or glide. So English allows for words like “stray” and “splinter” and “scream” /skrim/ in addition to words like “stop”, “spoke”, “skin”, and “twin”, “glance”, “queen” /kwin/. 
In fact, the maximum complexity that English allows in a syllable is something like CCCVCCC, as in the word strengths /strɛŋθs/, although it’s fairly rare.
 
 >  So when you borrow an English word into Spanish, [...] all of those consonant clusters that contain an /s/ don’t fit into what Spanish considers a reasonable syllable to be, so speakers will fix them somehow. Just like with Hawaiian and Japanese, we can do that by adding a vowel: that initial e- that you see in Esprite and also in Estefania (compare: Stephanie) or escuela (compare: school). The extra vowel means that the /s/ belongs to the previous syllable, so instead of sprite as a single CCCVC syllable, you have es.prite as two syllables: VC.CCVC.",eli5

2b1yk0,"Why do major civilian airliners fly over war zones? Seriously, I don't understand how anyone could think it's a good idea to fly over a state in anarchy and war. Is there any protocol? Does anyone have insight, I'm actually interested if there are any international laws governing this. ","There are government agencies (ICAO, FAA, etc...) that produce and publish notices and warnings, alerting airlines and flight crews to situations around the world that might require alternative flight plans, and air traffic control requirements. VERY rarely do agencies absolutely forbid overflight of an area, unless there is a clear threat of engagement by SAMs, which is very rare these days (until yesterday).

Airliners routinely fly over Iraq, Afghanistan, etc... without issue, and we have no reason to believe that there ever will be an issue. Yes, there are issues on the ground, but no one should (SHOULD) be firing SAMs at aircraft above 30 thousand feet.

These agencies had previously published restrictions and guidelines for aircraft transiting the area of eastern Ukraine, but only up to a certain altitude. MH17 was above that altitude. Many people are now criticizing the agencies for not applying the restriction to higher altitudes.

But, just understand that the agencies created their restrictions while balancing on the needs of the airline industry with the desire to maintain a safe altitude over a conflict area. There have been MANY airline flights over the area over the last 6 months, without incident or near-incident. Long-haul aircraft routinely traverse the airspace over troubled areas, because the threat of high-altitude SAM engagement has been seen as non-existent until yesterday.

Obviously the restrictions have changed since then.

But, just remember that MH17 was not doing anything illegal or restricted. It was taking the same route that many other aircraft were taking that day, and all were doing so legally.",eli5

Up until that point, men's clothing and appearance was more varied, brilliantly colored, and luxurious.   Wealthy men often wore high heels, makeup, wigs, and silks/satins.   After the GMR, the neutral colored suit became the only acceptable way for men to dress, and heels and makeup were out.   

Why?   At the time, it was a part of a conversation about how men were the tough, no-nonsense sex, while women were fragile and flighty.   Fashion and appearance were suddenly seen as topics inappropriate for men to be interested in.   

It was also a time when the industrial revolution was moving power from titled elites to a newly-emerging professional class of commoners - the neutral suit was a way to look like you ""meant business"" and separate yourself from useless aristocracy.",eli5

37izee,"America was founded by the British so how did Americans lose a British accent and maintain their own? Likewise how did different accents form across America (i.e. Boston, NY, Philly, Texas, ect.)? ","So first off, the most notable difference between American and British English -- non-rhoticity, i.e., not pronouncing the R in ""Park the car in Harvard Yard"" -- is an English innovation dating to around the time of the American Revolution that gradually took over most of the rest of England during the following centuries (because of the importance of London, where the non-rhotic accent apparently originated). Those of us who say the R's in that sentence are actually preserving an older pronunciation. American English preserves some other older features that have basically dropped out of the language in Britain -- ""gotten"" as the past participle of ""got"" is the only one I can think of right now, but I know there are others. That said, it isn't true that my standard American accent is closer to Shakespeare or King James's English than the Queen of England's accent is. They're both probably equally distant. 

So the non-rhotic accents of some parts of the US are a result of English influence -- that's why they're limited to the east coast. In New England, the further away you get from the Atlantic Ocean, the more R's you hear. I'm not sure if this is true for R-dropping accents in the South too, but I would suspect it is. Non-rhotic accents became the prestige accents in cities like New York and Boston, and because of the influence of these cities, this became sort of the most prevalent accent in US media. The bombastic sort of Britishy way of talking that you can hear in old movies is (a theatrical version of) this accent.

I think the contemporary standard American accent can ultimately be traced back to farmers in Pennsylvania and New York, who brought their accent to the central Midwest and then ultimately the West Coast. Most importantly, it's the local accent of southern California, which is the center of the American entertainment industry and has increased in cultural importance throughout the twentieth century. The increasing dominance of this rhotic accent has resulted in the weird fact that R-dropping, which used to be an upper-class thing on the east coast, has become pretty downmarket, and that's been measured objectively by a linguist who went to different department stores in New York and elicited the phrase ""fourth floor"" out of people who worked there. The employees at classier stores pronounced the R's far more often than the ones at the cheaper stores. 

The media hasn't totally leveled regional accents though, and some accents are actually on the rise. A good example of this is the ""Great Lakes"" or ""Inland North"" or ""Northern Cities"" accent, which is the accent that those people who say ""hat"" instead of ""hot"" and what sounds to me like ""hee-at"" instead of ""hat"" have. These people will generally swear that they can't possibly have an accent, that they're from the Midwest and that everyone knows people from the Midwest have the most generic accents in America. Well, they're wrong. 

I don't know where the Southern accent comes from either, although I think it's also somewhat new. I remember coming across a quote from a Civil War-era letter where some Confederate official lamented that their diplomat in Britain was too much of a southern hick to keep from calling himself ""Jeems"" instead of ""James"". I don't know if saying ""Jeems"" was widespread among southerners back then, but I've certainly never heard anything like it these days. I don't know where those odd mid-Atlantic accents came from either, but I'd love to know.",eli5

The iris is the muscular stuff that can constrict and change the size of your pupil. Your pupil isn't a structure: it's a hole whose size is changed by the constriction or relaxation of the iris.  
The cornea is the part of your eyeball that sits in front of the iris that has the lens in it.  
Your cornea has more nerves in it than the sclera does.  
When you touch (or poke) the cornea, you notice it more because more nerves get triggered.  
This makes sense, since the cornea is way more important than the sclera.

(Most of the times that Japan's views on sex do match up with the West, it was because of imperialism.)

To some degree, it's a result of anime becoming more developed and popular with more audiences. 

There was sex back then. Cutie Honey came out in the 1970s (also Robotech is the westernized version of the original Macross). 

A lot of these shows are meant for teenagers, not for children or adults. And Japanese teenagers are just as horny as ours.

3bn75c,Why do marathoners and triathletes tend to have small body frames? ,"Most body frames (skeletons) are very similar, and most ""shape"" comes from fat or muscle on those bones.

The heavier you are, the more work you have to do.  It's easier to move 150 pounds 100 feet than 200 pounds 100 feet.

Running results in injury to heavier people more often.  Joints stand up better to 150 pounds coming down on them than 200 pounds.  This is a ""[squares and cubes](_URL_0_)"" problem.  Stuff gets heavier basically in a cubic function, stuff gets stronger basically in a square function.  n^3 grows much faster than n^2.

Marathoning and training burns a lot of calories.  Compared to eating less, running isn't usually as effective for weightloss, but when you start talking 20 miles, you're talking about burning in the area of 2500 calories, which is more calories than the average person should consume per day.",eli5

1) They are acts of war. Only Congress can declare war. So off the bat, his drone program is unconstitutional.

2) They are war crimes. The drones are striking within the limits of foreign sovereign nations. 

3) Furthermore, the accuracy of these strikes has been called into question. It is estimated that only [2% of those killed by the strikes are ""high level militants""](_URL_4_)

4) There have been some very questionable targets. Such as [funerals and mourners.](_URL_3_) And sadly [this is not an isolated incident](_URL_0_) There are even reports of [rescuers being targeted](_URL_1_). If you can imagine a building near you blew up, you might offer to lend a hand without knowing who was in it. You also might get killed for it if you live in the Middle East where the Obama administration was droning. 

5) They are counterproductive. By engaging in this drone campaign we may ironically be creating ""terrorists"" at [a faster rate than we can kill them](_URL_2_)

6) There has been question if drones will be used for 24/7 surveillance in America. People argue this would be unconstitutional as a warrant is needed for surveillance beyond simply standing in public areas and looking into someones yard.

8sfd8p,"Why is Modern Family aired on ABC but produced by Fox? And why does Wikipedia say ""[the creators] did not pitch it to Fox"" if it's produced by Fox?","Ok, basically different television studios will pitch shows to different networks because they're not so sure that the television show will fit in at that network. When Modern Family hit the air in 2009, Fox basically did one night of comedy, which was mostly animated on Sunday nights, and Fox also has the NFL and NASCAR, which tends to preempt some of the shows during that Sunday night block on the East Coast. So, if you're a show like Modern Family, tone wise you already don't fit in, and there's good chance that you don't get a full season pick-up (again, at the time, Fox doesn't do Tuesday comedies), instead waiting until mid-season for something to fail.

Meanwhile, ABC at the time is hurting for sitcom programming at the time. They brought over ""Scrubs"" from NBC for its final season for Tuesdays, and on Wednesdays, basically everything was new. ""Cougar Town"" and ""The Middle"" all started in that Wednesday night line-up (along with a forgettable Kelsey Grammer show that apparently lasted a month) in 2009. Since ""Modern Family"" has performed consistently well in the ratings since its debut, that's where it stayed.

TL;DR: There was no room for ""Modern Family"" at Fox, ABC needed a sitcom, ratings have stayed up so ABC keeps up the contract instead of letting it go to Fox.

4nhtb5,What is a general ledger and why are there so many accounts? Title. I'm trying to understand some basic accounting and I just don't get GL and how it works.,"The general ledger is basically a giant sorting tool for measuring how cash enters the business, moves around in it, and exits the business.

Cash enters the business either through revenue (sale of product / service) or investment (equity), is maintained as various assets (cash, equipment, buildings), and exits through expenses (salaries, purchases).

The ledger can be very top-level and basic depending on the business, but can also involve many breakdowns of sub-type. A business might choose to distinguish online sales in one revenue account vs. sales from a physical store in another revenue account. Expenses could be broken out in various ways such as salaried employee's pay vs. hourly employee's pay.

The basic principle of dual entry accounting using the general ledger is that all transactions are paired as a debit to one account and a credit to another. A partner investing cash in the business, for example, is a debit to the cash account paired with a credit to the equity account. Buying a computer for the business would be a debit to the asset account tracking their in-use equipment while crediting the cash account. And so on and so forth, with varying levels of complexity.",eli5

8x6nbg,"How come Siri sucks when compared to Goolge/Alexa, even though it was the first voice assistant to the market","I would attribute it to the ability to play well with others, as in the base for their products. Let me explain: Apple, for the most part, creates their own hardware and software for all their products. While they do allow apps from 3rd party companies, they limit the number of permissions to their iPhones and iPads in order to keep them a ""closed"" system, and since Siri is a part of that software package, developers don't get to have as much cooperation with Siri as the Google Assistant, Alexa, or even Cortana. Also, if you look at the companies that design these assistants, they all admittedly have different goals and methods of getting to those goals. Siri was created as a voice assistant for iOS and related products, and that's it. Google Assistant was created by a company that also has the most popular search engine in the world AND created an open source OS for mobile phones and tablets, thus opening up the uses for Google Assistant and its knowledge pool. Alexa was created by the world's largest online retailer, which dabbles in devices that run on the same open source OS as a standard Android phone, plus they have developed a partnership with Microsoft that allows them to allow Cortana and Alexa to talk to each other, meaning that they have a link to one of the world's largest software companies and their knowledge base on making a voice assistant.

TL;DR: Siri is not as advanced as Alexa, Google, or even Cortana due to Apple's tendency to keep everything in house, as opposed to the partnerships and knowledge bases created by Google (Alphabet, if you're being technical), Microsoft and Amazon.",eli5

So why is it considered a bad thing by companies when you want to constantly check your credit score? EDIT: By checking, your score is lowered. It's pretty dumb to punish someone for trying to be organized and I honestly don't understand why that is.","There are two types of checks: soft and hard.

Soft inquiries happen when your credit is checked, but not for the purpose of getting a loan. This can be as part of a background check, or you checking your own credit. Soft inquiries *do not* lower your credit score.

Hard inquiries happen when your credit is checked to get a loan. The rationale behind your credit going down slightly when it is checked for a loan is that if you are very frequently trying to get loans, chances are higher you are in a financial situation that makes you a higher risk client/someone less likely to pay back the loan in full/on time. Thus your credit score (which is pretty much a reflection of your risk level) goes down.

Occipital is responsible for vision and Frontal is responsible for critical thinking, logic, reasoning etc.  In the brain of a sleeping person, the visual cortex is working yet the frontal lobe activity is severely diminished. So among believing any ridiculous thing, the diminished activity in the part of the brain that is responsible for logic makes it so that you really believe the things you see in your dream are going on.  So if you dream you're having sex with Kate Upton or Beyonce for instance.... you will have the most powerful nut of your life because you will believe that's happening even though that's ridiculous.  The reason you may wake up and have a vague memory or none at all but you obviously still know you came in your sleep is because of a mechanism I'm blanking on but it's just that you forgot your dream.  When you're awake your actual surroundings distract from the fantasy in your head because at the end of the day, when you're awake you know your fantasy isn't real (sucks, I know).

TL;DR:  Our brain plays tricks to make us believe illogical things while we dream and chances are we forget the dream when we wake.  The difference with wet dreams is we have physical evidence in the morning that the dream happened regardless of if we remember or not.",eli5

5u5svw,Why was helium discovered on the Sun before it was discovered on Earth? ,"Hydrogen and helium are light enough to escape Earth's gravity into space. That means there is essentially no elemental hydrogen or helium in our atmosphere. So, what's the difference between hydrogen and helium?

Hydrogen can react with other elements and form molecules. The most obvious source of hydrogen is water, which is basically everywhere. Basically, hydrogen got stuck to elements that were heavy enough to be held down by gravity.

Helium's chemical properties make it so it basically doesn't react with anything. That means that any helium that gets released will stay a gas, mix with the atmosphere, and eventually bleed off into space. There simply wasn't any helium around for scientists to discover.

Once scientists started to understand the [emission spectra](_URL_0_) of the elements, they realized they could look at sunlight and figure out what the sun is made of. Scientists started matching up the frequencies of light emitted by known elements with the frequencies the sun was emitting. They matched up all the frequencies and there were some frequencies coming from the sun that didn't match anything we knew. That eventually led people to look for helium and the other noble gases.",eli5

56ethf,Why do we assume other planets need water and/or oxygen to host lifeforms?,"This gets asked very often here so there are some good answers if you search. But most boil down to:

1. We don't assume it's the only kind of life possible but we know for a fact that our planet's combination can support life. We have limited time, limited resources, and i finite space, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts on those planets that we know have the right ingredients before looking at planets that we don't know have the right ingredients. 

If you lost your keys, you don't start by knocking on some stranger's door down the street and asking if your keys are by any chance in their tub. You start with the places your keys most likely are and where you have found them in the past.

2. There actually is good reason to think an earthlike planet is the most likely to support life. Namely, liquid water. For life to begin, chemicals have to come in contact with one another, probably millions of times. Liquid provides a medium for mixing and moving in a pre life way that gives these reactions  a chance. Given the elements most common in the universe, water appears to be the most abundant liquid. Water's polar nature also gives it freat disolving, organizing, and self insulating (top of the lake freezes first) properties that make it a particularly likely candidate. Carbon forms all kinds of great chains, and while silicone can too, it is less prevelant in the universe.

So there is decent reason to think life out there would be similar to warth, but it is limited resources not lack of imagination that makes scientists excited about goldilocks planets.

Edit: i may have been wrong about ratios of carbon to Si available on most planets.",eli5

4ael5c,Why does the foam on beer stay there for a much longer time compared to other fizzy drinks like soda? ,"The biggest difference is that beer, unlike simple carbonated solutions of water, contain additional compounds, which act as surfactants. Surfactants consist of chemical structures with both a polar part and a non-polar (""greasy"") part, as shown here. In beer, there are plenty of components that act as surfactants, especially proteins like glycoproteins. The important thing about surfactants in this case is that they reduce the surface tension of the water. To understand the main idea behind surface tension, look at this diagram. All water molecules are tugging on each other, but the molecules at the interface with air have no other molecules above them. This means that when you disturb (bend) the interface, it will naturally want to stretch back, and the surface tension is a measure of how strong this tendency to stretch back is. Surfactants on the other hand come in and reduce the water tension, which in turn reduces how much the water interface wants to contract and destroy the bubbles making up the foam in the process.
If you want to dig a bit deeper, the more detailed mechanism for how surfactants stabilize films is a a little more complicated and relies on the so-called Marangoni effect. You can see a cool demonstration of this effect here, but it's basic idea is that particles will spontaneously flow from regions with a lower surface tension to regions of higher surface tension. The way this effect manifests itself for foams is that if the foamy film is disturbed and becomes kinked as shown here, then because the surfactants move more slowly than the liquid in the interior of the film, the surface tension at the kink will be higher. This will then cause liquid to move from the area surrounding the kink (the region with lower surface tension) into the kink (the area with higher surface tension), thus restoring the shape of the film.",eli5

cehrs6,Why is it so hard for juries to convict a police officer when they shoot an unarmed civilian and there is clear evidence of excessive force?,"Self-defense laws are often intentionally worded to allow for some error in judgement, and specifically create the standard that ""feared for your life"" is a good enough reason to use deadly force, even if you were wrong. 

This is setup is honestly for a good reason.  Lets say I break into your house in the middle of the night, and am armed with either an unloaded gun or a realistic looking toy gun.  Technically you were in no danger from that weapon, but you shot and killed me...  The law can't cater to specific situations without creating more problems, so they give this lee-way. 

Meanwhile laws establishing police authority are often at conflict with regular criminal charges such as manslaughter, specifically because they grant powers to take away freedoms or take a life as part of the job.  So proving that a cop was wrongful in their actions often requires the prosecution to demonstrate a clear and specific malice (I really wanted to kill that guy), versus just plain on ""got scared and shot the dude"".  

Finally, throw in the fact that in general people still tend to trust the cops, and it becomes a monumental task to convict an officer.  A trial like that can cost the tax payers a lot of money, and knowing up front that you basically need a video of the officer saying ""Man, I sure do want to kill me somebody today"" to get a conviction, and it becomes not really worth the trouble to prosecute.",eli5

As humans evolved our brains developed past the point of basically every surrounding animal, and with that we created new sounds to communicate more complex things.

This in turns means that the bacteria squatting on your body, which are usually harmless at *worst*, in absence of management, throw a wild party in the under-protected mouth epithelium and cause ulceration as the immune system wakes up and decides to clean up the spots where that happened with the nuclear option.

That, or the change in immune response is not uniform, and the immune system goes apeshit on the same tissues for no real reason in absence of regulatory immune cells to keep them in rein.",eli5

 The reasons they do this is force is quadrupled as speed is doubled. So it takes 4 times the fuel to throw exhuast out of the engine at twice the speed, or twice the fuel to throw double the exhuast out at the same speed with the exact same increase in thrust.

1wt5y1,"Why, if I feel full eating one meal, don't I feel full if I eat a different meal that has the same number of calories? ","RD here. It's what you're eating (or not eating). You need a variety of macronutrients (protein, CARBOHYDRATES, and fat) to give your meal ""staying power"". 

Carbs are found in breads and fruits and sugar. They're good for instant energy BC they're broken down fast and absorbed quickly- but they're used up fast. Protein (found in meat, dairy, beans) takes longer to digest than carbs, and fat takes even longer. An ideal meal will contain all three (plus fiber, which helps you feel full because it's bulky, but isn't actually digested or absorbed by your body).

So if you eat 200 cal of like, fruit or crackers, the energy will be used up faster and you'll feel hungrier sooner than if you ate 200 calories of meat and cheese.

10kawg,Why apple released iOS 6 maps when it obviously wasn't ready for release. ,"Because google refused to license turn by turn, which was a HUGE feature. Apple had been trying to get turn by turn built in for years but they could never come to an agreement. Also, google changed it's pricing from wholesale licensing to pay-per-use, which would make the maps more expensive. On top of that, google started adding ads to their search results.

Apple was also getting nervous that google was collecting user info, so they made their own.

Basically they had 2 options:

1. Go another year without turn by turn, potentially losing users to android. Pay more for maps in the meantime as google advertised to their users.

2. Buy a bunch of mapping services, develop their own maps using third party data like tomtom or osm. Wait for the kinks to work themselves out through user reports.

8i49yi,Why does it feel so strange whenever I walk on to a stationary escalator?,"Basically every time you used the escalator, it moved by itself. The first times it felt weird because your body wasn't used to use stairs that move by themselves. So the first time you used an escalator, you probably felt like you lost balance and needed a few seconds to stabilise.

After many uses, your brain got it, and told your muscles and body in general to adapt, and to counter the movement of the escalator as you stepped on it. From the moment your body adapted to it, your brain knew that "" Big metal steps = need to balance and lean slightly forward "".

But this time, the escalators were not working, they were not moving. So when you stepped on it, your body leaned forward a little \( since your brain thinks that escalator = need to balance and lean forward a little \), but the escalators didn't move, so you kind of lost balance, that's why it feels weird.

Was it the terrain that made it difficult ?","The immediate cause of World War 2 was Hitler's desire to dominate the European continent.

However, domination doesn't necessarily require an invasion. Switzerland allowed the Nazis to continue banking with them throughout the war, and Swiss factories produced some vital military components for them too. Given that the Swiss were willing to freely offer that much cooperation, additional gains from invading and occupying Switzerland would not have been worth the cost.

Hitler wanted a similar arrangement with the United Kingdom, but the Brits were completely opposed to a German-dominated Continent.

 > France

The Germans wanted French territory lost after WW1, which the French were unwilling to give up, and the French were historical enemies of Germany. The people of France would not have accepted neutrality and even if they had, the Germans never would have trusted a neutral France at their backs to stay neutral.

 > Poland

One of Hitler's war aims was to depopulate Eastern Europe and repopulate it with German settlers. Again, this is something the Polish people never could have rolled over and accepted.

 > Czechoslovakia

Ditto Czechoslovakia

af7fal,Why is buying in bulk cheaper than buying stuff individually?,"Because some costs of an item are the same independent of how many you are purchasing. For instance, imagine that you need to buy a lot of paper for your business. The cost will include the paper itself, but also the cost of shipping. If you bought one pallet of paper the cost might be $1000 for the paper and $100 for the shipping.

But, if you bought 10 pallets of paper, they still need to send just a single truck. So, the shipping cost might not go up at all and you're only paying for the extra paper itself. So, each item is cheaper per unit because the shipping cost is spread out across all of the pallets.

","Historically, anyone can could to the U.S and work hard enough to achieve what ever it is they want. Not a lot of other countries  were able to provide that for their citizens.  (back when America was actually the greatest, most powerful and prosperous nation)


As this became more and more popular it was kind of engraved into society that America is # 1 in everything and anything. It will/would be really difficult to get that notion out of society and I'm sure that process has begun within the last few years. The recession, education, crime, etc is all coming to light and the quality of life of other nations is beginning to  improve more and more. Some nations have much better standards of living but we're stuck in our bubble that we fail to see it. 


Not all is bad though, I want to give you a simple scenario that hopefully gives you a little perspective. Let's say you are an 18 year old who wants to buy an Iphone. You work a part time job, making minimum wage and your first pay check is a whopping $150 bucks. You live at home, so there are no bills to pay. You save $100 of it for your Iphone. The next week you take the other $200 and go out and get yourself that new Iphone.

Now take a 5 hour flight down to Mexico as the same 18 year old and you first struggle to find a job, any job. You FINALLY find a job that pays you $500 pesos (minimum wage there, or roughly $44 a week). 

There, cell phone service is monopolized and outrageously expensive. You want that Iphone there? sure, no problem. Just save up $10,000 pesos (cell phones are not subsidized by carriers like they are here).

Now can you imagine how long it would take you to save up for that Iphone at that wage? 


that is what makes the U.S so attractive to foreigners and that's why they see the U.S as ""# 1"". The opportunities and the amount of things you can accomplish are incomparable to what you could do in another nation.",eli5

The degree of damage or not depends on the acceleration versus the strength of the structure. Insects have an exoskeleton which will move as a whole rather than a soft body like us where the shock wave of acceleration force has to travel through our organs before the opposite side of the body from the impact starts to move.

A second factor is that as our hand moves through the air to swat the fly it builds up a wave of air in front. That pushes the fly forward somewhat and so lessens the impact. It's part of the reason that the business end of fly swatters are a mesh rather than a solid flap, let's the air through.",eli5

305mut,Why aren't Inline 5 Engines More Common? I can understand with some flaws such as required injection but it is a good balance between inline 4 and inline 6.,"The problem is balance.

From a design standpoint, they only ever became viable with the advent of fuel injection, because of the odd number of cylinders and length of the manifold, there is no combination of carburetors that made any sense between symmetry and complexity; you couldn't feed all cylinders evenly.

From a vibration standpoint, the engine has a power stroke every 144 degrees of crank rotation which lasts 180 degrees (TDC to BDC of the power stroke). This means there is overlap between power strokes of any two cylinders. This is normally ideal, in even numbered cylinder engines... But in this odd number of cylinders, there is going to be unbalanced vibration between the last and the first cylinder. Also, torque is (naturally) not even throughout the stroke, meaning the odd overlap generates second and third order vibration; the engine is only going to be smooth at a narrow mid-range speed.

Additionally, an i5 takes up more space than an i4 or a v6, both of which have other advantages pertaining to symmetry and balance.",eli5

ul1vg,"Why is healthcare so expensive in America? Why is it that other countries like Canada and Australia can afford universal healthcare and still manage to compensate their physicians just as well as they do in America. Where is all this extra money going that hospitals in America are charging? I saw [this ](_URL_0_)on my fb news feed and was completely dumbfounded.
","Two things to say here.

First, the direct cost in hospitals is high because you can see it at all. Of course the care in Australia is not *actually* free, it's just that you don't see the bill directly because it goes directly to the Australian taxpayer. As far as you know, the Australian cost was just as high as in the USA.

But regardless of this, healthcare spending in America is extraordinarily high compared to most countries with nationalised healthcare. In fact, America spends almost as much of its GDP on healthcare as (for instance) the UK does! But the UK public healthcare takes care of everything for everyone, whereas Americans need insurance on top of that.

The reason for this is that private insurance really has a strong incentive to perform badly and inefficiently, since it's profit based. Insurance companies have very large overheads because they're for profit, not actually for improving peoples lives efficiently, though this is something that obamacare tries to address. As a matter of good business, they also will try not to insure people who will cost them money...that is, people that need healthcare. Since it's too barbaric to actually deny these people healthcare, the burden of their treatment falls on the state despite the private system. These costs can also trickle down to hospitals and inflate bills.

There seems to be an element of hospitals wanting to get in on the action on the for-profit front. Possibly they are themselves run in a more for-profit way than in countries with nationalised healthcare. If so, they also have an incentive to charge as much as they can, which in turn increases the insurance bills and the overall healthcare cost, plus of course the direct bill to anyone receiving it from the hospital.",eli5

2sbftu,"Why is Fox News considered not credible? My mother is a conservative and father a liberal. Whenever my mother watched Fox News, I would occasionally watch, and I never understood why it is so widely discredited.","I encourage you to work on critical thinking with regards to the media. This is not criticism of you, not at all, but when you can listen to Fox News and _hear_ what they're doing that people criticize, you will become far more able to make your own independent decision than like 85 - 90 percent of Americans - and it's a skill that applies to all media outlets. Fox News (and to a lesser but very real extent MSNBC) are great places to practice this.

Here's an example: Say that Obama went to a United Nations conference and played a game of golf with David Cameron (the conservative prime minister of the UK) while the conference was out of session. These are the facts.

_how_ the facts are presented is mostly where people get upset about media slant. A middling pro-Obama headline (like one might see on MSNBC) might say,

""Obama reaches across the aisle to demonstrate goodwill to foreign conservative UK Prime Minister David Cameron""

a more extreme anti-Obama headline (like one might see on Fox News) might say,

""Obama leaves United Nations conference; spends thousands of dollars to waste time with David Cameron instead of focusing on domestic problems""

Each of these are _presuming something_ on the facts. For all we know, Obama and Cameron just both like golf. They may never have talked about politics at all, and the conference was out of session so there was little work to be done. However, the media slant invents a story _that interprets the facts in a way that's designed to gain viewership, not to report the story_. They're doing what tabloids do; the difference is that we all generally know that tabloids are not real news, they're entertainment.

Fox is absolutely extreme about this: they often misrepresent facts, cherry-picking data they want to show, inferring motives on the people in the story, and so on. If you go to [Your Logical Fallacy Is](_URL_3_) and study up on all of the different logical fallacies, you'll start to see them all the time when listening to _any_ mainstream news outlet. Fox News is the prime example of this, so people focus on them, but you'll hear these in MSNBC as well.

I have no problem with this if people understood that they were watching entertainment; for instance, watching The Daily Show, it's clear that it's an entertainment show whose premise is based on news items. Fox News _represents itself as actual news_, though, and enough people believe it, that [studies have found that watching Fox News makes you less informed about the world than watching no news at all](_URL_1_).

EDIT: I was remiss on my original statement for the link above, as others have pointed out, by not mentioning that exclusive viewers of MSNBC were, in this study, _also_ less informed than the ""no news"" population. I was focusing on Fox News because they were the direct subject of the question, but they both do disservice to their viewers' knowledge of what's going on insofar as this study found.

I thought I'd add in some more information about the accuracy of news networks: I like [PolitiFact](_URL_0_) as an independent measure of the truthfulness of media statements for stuff like this. They have some meters to measure [how well networks are doing in reporting facts](_URL_2_) which are interesting with regards to this discussion",eli5

Schizoaffective disorder is basically like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder had an angsty child together. Its manageable, but it never goes away. I would imagine that it would make for a strenuous at best relationship for both parties. My cousin was diagnosed with schizophrenia, went off meds, and is currently and probably permanently hospitalized. My mother had bipolar disorder. Just imagining them together in one person, even when its not at the worst, would be hard to cope with. Any kind of depressive disorder makes maintaining a relationship painful to both parties, and far too few people understand that depressive disorders isn't just someone feels sad, and they have no control over it so they can't just think happy thoughts and make it all rainbows and sunshine. Just being alive is sometimes a struggle. That has a way of wearing down anyone, and yes I mean anyone even if they genuinely and truly love you from the bottom of their heart.

To my understanding, the first recognizably human beings originated around Ethiopia, in a warm climate which they were well adapted to. At some point, across millions of years, early human migrations spread the species across nearly the entire planet. But why?

What possessed them to get on primitive rafts and cross oceans to land in Australia or South America? ","It was a very slow process. Some theories state that humans actually followed the same habitat as it moved north following the end of an Ice Age. Also keep in mind that we're talking a really long time scale.

68frqt,why increased atmospheric CO2 levels don't just mean healthier more lush plant life which in turn offset that CO2. .,"Photosynthesis = H20 + CO2 + Light (particularly UV/V/B light) made into O2 (oxygen gas) + C6H12O6 (Sugar).... Let's keep that simplification in mind for now.

When we think about plants making O2 to offset the CO2 production, you run into two key limitations: water and rate of photosynthesis. When there is no water (particularly clean, harmless water), it prevents the process of photosynthesis from occurring. That is why a drought can be devastating in that regard. This usually isn't an issue as rain forests contribute much of the plant-based global-O2 generation and these environments are not insanely water deprived (but global warming and deforesting have still affected this cycle in some regards).

The biggest issue is rate of photosynthesis. Just because more CO2 is present, that does not mean the plant will engage in photosynthesis much quicker. Think of it like this: let's say your car tops out at 100mph. Does adding more gas in your tank make your car faster? The answer - no. Your car (plant) is still limited by its internals (plant chlorophylls) regardless of how much gas (CO2) is in the tank (atmosphere).

bv13zi,Why don’t more countries use nuclear power? ,"It depends on what time period you are talking about because in Europe it cause a mass protest movement in the 80's (especially in Germany and Austria) in which they held a public referendum where the people voted to end all nuclear power. They were worried about the effects waste would have considering the power plants that were being protested were close to the Danube river. 

While others simply can't afford or get access to the materials needed for nuclear power. 

Others are worried about the effects it would have on their economies due to international intervention. The US is still sanctioning Iran for following all the INF regulations agreed to in the Iran nuclear deal and what other country would want those sanctions that cripple the economy. 

Other countries have not used it as much because of accidents like what happened in Japan when a nuclear power plant was hit by a tsunami causing even more damage to the surrounding area than if it weren't there.

The Arabic script is written from right to left, because it's ancestor Aramaic was written from right to left, because Phoenician was, for whatever reason, and they stuck with it, for some reason.

605k4n,"Why is it that when we think about breathing, we generally start to breathe manually? ","Some background:

Breathing is controlled by a part of your brain called the medulla oblongata which is involved in regulating many of the bodily processes that are controlled automatically like blood pressure, heart rate and respiration, and your breathing rate depends on the concentration of acid in your blood. If your blood is too acidic, then you will convert the acid into carbon dioxide and breathe it out. When you exercise, your body produces lactic acid and you convert the acid part into carbon dioxide which is also acidic and then breathe it out, also oxygen is also converted to carbon dioxide by cellular respiration, especially in your muscles, and you breathe this out too, that's why you breathe more when you exercise and often struggle to breathe if you do too much exercise. The level of oxygen isn't really taken into account and if you go high enough (10,000ft/4000m) the amount of oxygen in the air won't be enough to use so you'll get altitude sickness where you don't get enough oxygen, you feel really lethargic and get a headache, you have to consciously remember to breathe more, because your body doesn't realise it doesn't have enough oxygen, because the carbon dioxide levels are normal, just trying to remember to breathe while on a mountain is exhausting after a while. Eventually you'll make more blood cells so your body will get more efficient at using the oxygen, the motto is 'climb high, sleep low' because the symptoms are dangerous when we're asleep but training at altitude will make your body adapt eventually.

We have evolved so that we can breathe without thinking about it, but we've also evolved so that we can control it by thought. Through controlled breathing you can actually calm yourself down when you're upset, or you can hold your breath when there's dangerous chemicals in the air. 

I guess breathing manually when you think about it is like your brain saying 'good job medulla, I've got it for the next few mins because my hooman wants me to think about this'.",eli5

5vobfv,Why is it rude to ask someone their salary?,"money is very personal to most people as it is essentially what controls what you can and can't do, where you can and can't go, and even to some degree who you can and can't be. even on a personal basis knowing the financial limitation or freedom that someone experiences can affect the way other people treat them. 

also money for the average person is a major source of stress on a day to day basis, so bluntly asking someone how much they make may put their mind in an uncomfortable place, with all of the things, and potentially people, that depend upon the money they are making, which could very well be below the amount of money their life requires.

on the opposite side of the spectrum, if someone is well off it might make them embarrassed. the reason for this may seem silly to you if you aren't in their situation, but talking about how much money they make may cause them to feel like they are bragging, so answering your question puts them in an awkward position where they are forced to either deny the question and seem rude to you or tell you a dollar amount and inadvertently feel uncomfortable about something they wouldn't have brought up in the first place. by denying the question it is justified in their mind due to the privacy they'd like to keep their finances surrounded with and you interpreting this as rudeness will probably not bother them, rather than the total transparency and vulnerability a straightforward answer would provide, which may seem perfectly fine to you but feels unnecessary and unwarranted to them.

 These are the breakdown products of the bile pigment bilirubin. Bilirubin is itself a breakdown product of the heme part of hemoglobin from worn-out red blood cells. Most bilirubin is partly broken down in the liver, stored in the gall bladder, broken down some more in the intestines, and excreted in the feces (its metabolites are what make feces brown), but some remains in the bloodstream to be extracted by the kidneys where, converted to urobilins, it gives urine that familiar yellow tint. [Here is a super, diagram example of how this works, Not ELI5; more like ELI Am Heisenberg for you Chemistry buffs](_URL_0_)


These same yellow chemicals also cause the yellow color of jaundice and of bruises, both of which result when more hemoglobin than usual is being broken down and/or the processing of its breakdown products by the liver is not able to keep up. Lastly, when we drink lots of fluids, we ~~saturate~~ dilute our pee which makes it less yellow. When we are dehydrated, you get this stinking, brown pee that is no good in your body.

The thing I don't understand is, a jury just found the guy not-guilty in an arguably higher court, how would there be any basis for a Civil suit?

Also I remember OJ Simpson losing the Civil Suit after winning the murder charges. How does this happen?","The two suits are trying to remedy different types of harm.  Take murder for an example.  Murder harms the *community* because the it loses a member and everyone else has to live in greater fear of death.  But murder also harms the victim's family members who lose a person they love and depend on for support.  

In a criminal trial, the prosecutor seeks remedy for the defendant's actions against the community.  The prosecutor tries to send the defendant to *jail* in order to punish and incapacitate him, and also to deter other would-be criminals.  

In a civil trial, the victim's family is trying to get *financial compensation* for the fact that they lost a family member.

In most cases, victims don't bother suing murderers, robbers, rapists, etc., because the criminals usually don't have any money.  But take a securities fraud case against a large bank or a company.  Civil suits often get filed in the wake of a criminal trial or investigation against a large corporation, simply because the company has money and other assets that it can use to pay the victims.",eli5

Currently there is no way to effectively kill a virus, because it is a really strange little beastie.

Viruses don't actually have cells that divide, **added, thanks ProtestTheHero**, it's that they aren't cells. They're a mass of proteins and DNA or RNA, and will multiply using the host body's own cells.  This means that the only effective way to wipe out a virus that has already infected a host is to wipe out the host's own cells.

Not really feasable when, in the case of a cold, the cells in question are lung tissue, and you need them to breathe.

There are two branches of medicine that do work on virus prevention or cure:

Immunisation.  This simulates the effects of a specific virus, meaning that your body's own defences grow immune, and next time you are exposed to the virus, you body can effectively fight it off.

In the case of ~~influenza~~rhinovirus (the cold), it is a rotovirus, meaning that it has subtle changes year in year out.  Also, there are many, many strains of the cold, so if you get sick one year, another strain could get you the next.

Anti-Viral Drugs:  They actually don't do anything to the virus itself, but will block the virus from entering your cells.

After such a long time it may seem irrelevant, but why didn't it happen in the first few years?

France (like many nations) won't extradite its own citizens to face foreign charges.

When you crack your neck, you put pressure on the fluid in these joints, which in turn changes the distribution of air in the joints.

30n8h3,"If sanitizers kill 99.99% of germs, how come there aren't any germs that are resistant to it? Essentially, why is it that not using a full prescription of antibiotics breeds stronger bacteria but sanitizer doesn't breed stronger germs?","TL;DR: Antibiotics are really specific and bacteria can mutate just a little bit to avoid them. Hand sanitizers nuke them from orbit and they don't have any way to avoid this.

The main reason has to do with how they kill the bacteria. Antibiotics target a very specific protein in the cell that is critical for a bacterium to survive. For example, pencillin stops bacteria from building their protective cell wall by inhibiting a specific enzyme involved in this process. Without the enzyme they can't make a cell wall so they are structurally unsound and die. Different antibiotics will target different proteins. However, since it's only one protein that they target, it doesn't take much for a bacterium to mutate and avoid their effects.  

Sanitizers (I'll talk about the most common type of hand sanitizers here) use alcohol to kill bacteria and work in an entirely different way. One way alcohol kills is by dissolving the cell membrane. Since all cells need membranes and they must have a certain structure, there's no way that you can make a membrane that's not sensitive to dissolving with ethanol. Alcohol also destroys proteins in a very nonspecific way. No matter what mutations occur in these proteins, they are still fundamentally the same molecule and can be destroyed by ethanol. Taken together, this means that resistance is essentially impossible.
 
As an aside, some types of sanitizers are less specific and less powerful than alcohol. Resistance to these can be developed relatively easily.",eli5

alx64y,How did people from earlier times get clean drinking water without our modern methods? ,"The simplest response: booze!

Back then, there was a very poor to limited understanding of water quality leading to illness. There would not have been attempts to purify the water, since it was not understood that this needed to be done to have potable water. The concept simply didn't exist.

However, it was noted that drinking alcoholic beverages or diluted beverages did noticeably reduce the rate of illness. As a result, people learned to harness fermentation to provide themselves with something to drink that wouldn't kill them. This didn't always work, as in the cholera outbreaks in England when drinking alcohol 24/7 was not an option and many still had to rely on plain water. However, much of our culture's association with alcohol is in part due to the discovery that it was safer to get a little buzzed than to crap your guts out by drinking plain water.",eli5

2ygeun,Why is gambling is considered a dangerous vice? ,"Okay, you're asking two questions here.

1. Why is gambling considered a dangerous vice? Because some people have the tendency to become addicted to gambling and it can engulf their entire life. They will spend every last dime to chase that feeling of winning. In the end though, the house always wins and that's why it's a business.

2. Why can you join the army but not gamble because of your age? Well, it depends on the state (assuming US) you live in, and also the type of gambling. Some states, depending on the form of gambling (lottery, casino, etc.) do allow gambling at 18. The other answer is outdated laws or laws that make zero sense. 

You're correct that in some place you may not be allowed to gamble because of your age, but you can enlist to go and possibly die. You are also not allowed to drink or smoke (some states). One can go and risk their life for country, but god forbid they have a beer after work.",eli5

The thing is, quiet sounds are incredibly low-energy. In order to detect the faintest sounds, those hairs need to be ultra tiny and lightweight - which makes them very fragile. Loud sounds, on the other hand, have exponentially more energy. If the sound is loud enough, it can bend or even break these hairs, rendering them unable to pick up sounds as well or at all, and we have no real method of perfectly regenerating them.

5nl5yi,Why radiation is so dangerous and how it sticks around for so long? Like why is Chernobyl still so dangerous?,"Well, it's not across the board. It depends on what you're working with. It's also important to note you're talking about ionizing radiation, which is either alphas (helium 4), betas (electrons and positrons), gammas and X-rays (High frequency EM waves), and neutrons.

The biggest mechanism for health problems is penetration into cells and causing cell death. It can also cause damage by breaking down chemical bonds, especially in your DNA leading to cancers.

Different isotopes create different types of ionizing radiation that penetrate to different depths. Betas for example, are pretty easy to stop with just plastic- which is why it's important to wear safety glasses- betas cause cataracts. A common beta emitter is 18F, used in PET scans.

Your skin does a pretty good job of stopping penetration, but your internal membranes? Not so much. That's why ingesting is so dangerous. When I get radiation dosimeter reports, they give results for skin dose, extremity dose, eye dose, and deep dose.

Neutrons penetrate like a motherfucker, but they don't have long lasting effects. When the source is turned off (I.e. Particle accelerator beam hitting a target, the neutrons stop.) You're talking like 10 ft think concrete walls to stop them.

As for lasting long? They all don't. All isotopes have different halflifes, from minutes (C11) to hours (F18 is 119 minutes) to thousands of years (C14)",eli5

21aixq,Why exactly were the Armenians targeted during the Armenian Genocide? My friend needs some help and I did some google searches and I was surprised when I couldn't really find out why they were targeted. I know the effects and everything else BUT the causes and why they were targeted. Thanks. ,"I'm going to repost an answer I made here a year ago that people liked. There's quite a lot of words because it's a long and complicated thing with a lot to it, but I tried to keep it clear and simple and readable:

So in the late 1800's there were people in the area we now call Turkey: The Ottoman Empire, along with a group of people called the Armenians who lived amongst them. It's important to know why they hated each other and what led to the genocide, which I'll try to condense down and put in plain English, but if you don't care about that, just scroll to the last two paragraphs.

The region was a fractured mess at the time, with the Ottomans in charge under a sultan. The Armenians started a big movement to come together as a single nation, but rather than as an independent nation, they wanted to cosy up to Russia for protection, who otherwise could have been a threat who would invade them, and they didn't believe the Ottomans could have protected them from that happening. Basically, they picked the side of a nearby country instead of the rulers of the land they inhabited, for pragmatic reasons.

The Sultan of the Ottomans offered up various protections to the Armenians, but his heart wasn't in it; the Armenians were distrusted for siding with the Russians, and for a few decades relations between the two groups soured badly. It culminated in the sultan giving legal rights to Kurdish bandits to openly go sacking and looting Armenian towns.

Meanwhile, Europe was busy messing around with all kinds of politics and got involved. One of these things was a treaty the sultan was supposed to sign which would limit the acts of these asshole bandits. He signed it just because. Nothing changed, no action was taken against the bandits, and it was clear he really thought of the Armenians as second class citizens or worse. This finally resulted in the open massacre of Armenians by these bandit groups that the sultan turned a blind eye to, which made people realise that thing the sultan signed was complete bullshit.

Europe said ""hey now, that's just not fair"" and began to get involved again, including that friend of the Armenians, Russia. The sultan just played this off as a blatant power grab. This was like when America poked its nose into Iraq and suddenly the entire Middle East erupted in anti-American sentiment, pretty much everyone in the Ottoman Empire began raging against Europe's underhand meddlings in local affairs. The Armenians were held firmly to blame for the whole lot of it as instigators.

So now we have lots of anger and hatred on both sides.

Suddenly, in 1908, the sultan is deposed by revolutionaries known as the Young Turks! Armenians rejoice! And are blamed too. They're total whipping dogs of the empire at this point. But whatever, the sultan is done with, this will end their oppression, hoorah.

But then the Young Turks are struck with a counter-coup, oh no! Violence erupts. Ottoman troops openly attack and kill Armenians in the various struggles that ensue (and to be fair, vice versa). The new government (a monarchy in fact) is still composed of Turkish people who hate the Armenians, oh dear. But we're still not up to genocide yet.

1912, first Balkans war breaks out, most of the Ottoman Empire is lost to Christian nations of Europe and Russia. I'll let you guess who received a lot of blame for damaging the politics of the Empire and causing the loss etc. But part of the fallout is that many, many Muslim Ottoman refugees fall back from these now-Christian territories, and land in heavily Armenian-populated areas. Powderkeg set up.

1914, World War 1 breaks out. Russia and the Ottoman Empire are on opposite sides. Russia calls upon lots of its little Armenian bros to help fight shit, and conscripts a whole lot of them. The shit majorly hits the fan.

Long story short, this upgraded the status of Armenians in the eyes of Ottomans from ""upstart troublecausers"" to ""the legitimate enemy"" and kicked off a whole lot of serious persecution of Armenians regardless of the individual's politics or beliefs. In 1915, the Ottomans officially began deporting Armenians from their lands, and unofficially began massacring them.

----Start Here For The Bit About The Genocide----

The ""Armenian Genocide"" as it's remembered began around April 1915 and continued until 1918. There were many stages to it. Thousands of Armenians were taken from a single village and burned alive, thousands more women and children were taken aboard boats under the pretense of deportation, then the boats capsized in the Black Sea, drowning them all. Ottoman doctors replaced vaccinations with poisons, then forged death certificates to say they died of natural causes. In May 1915, the major deportations began. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians, anyone ""sensed"" to be a threat to national security based on their being Armenian, were thrown from their house and sent marching. They were sent into the desert, with no supplies of food or water, destined for makeshift concentration camps, before the Ottoman government legally claimed all their ""abandoned"" possessions. These were later proven to be intentional orders of genocide. People starved, fell ill, or were attacked by bandits or even the very soldiers marching them, dying in their thousands on what are now commonly called death marches. Those few who reached the concentration camps discovered they were only intended to house people for a few days, which was to be their life expectancy. They were just left to starve and die. Final death toll is estimated between 600,000 and 1,500,000 Armenians.

Shortly after, World War 1 ended, the Ottoman Empire was somewhat dissolved, and a local war of independence broke out, leading to the nation of Turkey somewhat as it exists today. In Turkey, they don't like this part of their history, and refuse to accept it as a genocide. It's simply referred to as ""the 1915 event"" or other such vagueness, and is never taught in schools and in public is openly denied. A few years back someone publicly tried to raise recognition of the events and was attacked, legally charged, and eventually assassinated over it. The official Turkish government stance remains that Armenians were traitors to the Empire and had to be handled as such in a wartime situation. There's a slow, slightly growing movement to officially recognise it as a genocide, but it's still not something you should ever really bring up if you visit Turkey.",eli5

And black is what we experience when we don't see any light at all.

The rainbow also doesn't include all colours we can experience. For example, there's no magenta/pink in the rainbow, because that os what we experience when we detect both red and blue light at the same time, which doesn't happen in a rainbow because rainbows are sorted from lower frequency red light through higher frequency blue light - there is no pink frequency, and since the red and the blue are on opposite sides of the spectrum, they don't blend into each other the way, for example, red light blends through yellow into green light.",eli5

The mere fact that I'm even alive seems to irritate her at this time.","I think there are several things. 

The biggest one for me, is I am just all around pissed that I am on my period. For instance, having to work sucks, but having to work when I have cramps is just the worst ever, and that alone pisses me off. 

Being in constant pain puts me in a horrible mood. Not being able to fit into my pants depresses me and pisses me off. I am hungry more, and yet the only thing that satisfies are things like chocolate, ice cream and donuts, and since I am already fat and can't fit into my pants, I can't eat these things, which pisses me off, or I do eat those things, which pisses me off.

I hate to get gross on you, especially since you are 5 and all, but a lot of women get diarrhea and have to pee a lot more often. And trust me, bleeding out your vag for several days on end sucks. I feel all around just...dirty. Most men wouldn't touch us with a 10 foot pole, and a lot of men will touch us enough to tease us then politely request a BJ (sorry if you are 5, I am not explaining what that is). Since we have raging hormones, there is a chance we actually WANT to 'do it,' but can't because it is disgusting. This pisses me off.

Then there is the whole chemical imbalance. We are losing blood, so we have a drop in blood sugar which dramatically affects the mood. Our hormones change, also affecting our mood. We lose blood, and this causes a drop in iron, causing fatigue and irritability. Knowing that this is happening to me, making me mad or sad for no reason, pisses me off.

It is as if you got food poisoning once a month. Every month you know it is coming. You know you are going to be in pain, in the bathroom, and there is really nothing to help or stop it. You are just told to live with it until you are around 60 and then it gets worse before it gets better. On top of hating that, your body also releases hormones  that make you even more angry/depressed when it comes. It just sucks.

EDIT: These are all worst case scenarious, just like food poisoning, some months you are OK with it and it is not THAT bad, other months you really are in no mood to start vomiting for the next 5 days.",eli5

As others have said, it's an orange plastic film coated with aluminum. It functions as insulation. Heat is gained or lost through three mechanisms - conduction, convection, and radiation. In space only one of these mechanisms applies - radiation. (Meaning that hot objects cool down by radiating infrared light.) The shiny, mirrored surface reflects sunlight away, preventing overheating on the sunny side. It also reflects IR light radiated by the spacecraft back toward itself to keep the dark side cold. Without this insulation, objects in full sunlight become very hot and objects in shadow become very cold. Rotating objects swing wildly up and down in temperature. Since heating causes materials to expand, and cooling causes them to contract, this would cause huge amounts of stress on almost every component of the spacecraft as it changed shape over and over. 

Beyond this, conductive materials block beta rays (which are loose electrons flying through space). 

Lastly this can help protect against high speed dust particles by breaking up the dust particle a short distance away from the actual spacecraft hardware. This means that the force of the impactor will be spread out over a larger area, decreasing its potential for damage.",eli5

241qpy,"Why are some people ""morning people"" and some ""evening people""? ","Because your body needs to produces various enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, etc. throughout the day in order to keep you functioning. The timing of their production is pretty important as many of these processes can interfere with each other, or are only needed at certain times like when you are eating, waking up, going to sleep, etc. 

These processes occur on a roughly 24 hour schedule, which we call the circadian rhythm. However, this being a biological system, nothing is ever precise. This cycle is regulated by the production of certain molecules, and their production is controlled by certain genes. Some people have mutations in those genes that give variations in the production of these regulatory molecules, which in turn produce variations in the circadian rhythm that they control. Therefore you get people who might have a 22-hour circadian cycle for example or a 27 hour one. However because our calendar day is still 24 hours, these people are thrown out of sync with the world around them and have internal schedules of activity that can make them morning or evening people. 

These things are further screwed up by the fact that many people nowadays have weird shift-work schedules which throws their sleep schedule even more off. On top of that, the circadian regulation is itself controlled to a great degree by your exposure to light (thats how your body knows to wake up in the morning). However with the constant degree of illumination many of us live with 24 hours a day (streetlights, night-lights, etc.) our internal clocks are getting even more confused these days.

1ei8av,"Why are turbans used and would those who use them be offended that I want to try and wear one? 

I've asked a couple people who I have seen wearing turbans/cloth head dressings, Why they wore them and the general response was its personal, tradition or religious.... I notice on tv and movies (great resources i know) that people who most commonly wear them live in or come from places where its hotter, ie. Middle Eastern countries or African Countries.... Am I wrong to assume this is because it some how cools them down? I imagine the heat making them sweat and the sweat staying in the turban and cooling them down. 

I have always loved the look of these turbans and to think I could wear something that was also beneficial would be great, but I am not looking to offend people on a spiritual level or disgrace a religion...","Your question is describing two different headdresses: Sikh men wear a Turban (the sort of mushroom looking, wrapped cloth, often a bright colour) and Middle Eastern men wear a khaffiya (the patterned, loosely draped head cloth).

Sikhism is based on the 5 K's, I can never remember them all, but the Turban on men is one of them.

A khaffiya is worn in Arabic countries as most are very desert like and the desert sun is very hot and intense so a head covering is required.  Also, when the khamsin (desert storm) comes (French = mistral, Italian = sirocco, for when the desert storms blow off the Sahara and cross the Mediterranean sea), the high winds and blowing sand can be both very uncomfortable to painful and dangerous.  Wrapping the cloth khaffiya around your face helps to ward off the sand.  The khaffiya is held in place with the aghal, the halo-like black cord you see on top.  Regional areas of the Middle East have distinct patterns and colours of the khaffiya:

Black and white, average density pattern, woven = most countries

Black and white, light pattern, block printed = Syria

Red and white, heavy density pattern, woven = Jordanian Desert Patrol (police), these khaffiyas are beyond gorgeous.

Pure white = gulf states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, etc.

Khaffiyas have become popular all over the world as a fashion scarf so of course entrepreneurial companies have made all sorts of alternate colour combinations, but I've only seen them in North America, never in the Middle East.

Now, this is pure hearsay, I've never seen or read confirmation, but I've been told that even the way a man wraps or folds his khaffiya has meaning.  The example always given was the now deceased leader of the Palestinians, Yasser Arafat, had a distinctive wrap with a forehead crease signifying ""at war"".  Again, interesting story, never confirmed.

Above I capitalized Turban for Sikhs, but elsewhere in and around the Sahara peoples that don't really identify as Arab such as the Berber or Tuareg also wear a turban for the same reason as Arabic men wear a khaffiya.  The Tuareg turban is a fascinating piece of fabric: they beat indigo dye into linen as water in the Sahara desert is for drinking, not dying cloth.  This is why the Tuareg dark blue turbans appear metallic or shiny.",eli5

rjw1k,"Why is my Hotmail account so much more susceptible to spam being ""sent"" by me and junk emails being sent to me than my Gmail account? ","Short answer: Google spent a lot of money and hired a bunch of smart people to solve the spam problem. They have spent lots of money on making Gmail less susceptible to spam being sent by you or sent to you. 

Microsoft has also spent lots of money, and hired smart people to solve the same problem. They probably even use really similar techniques as Gmail, from the users perspective, Google has just been more successful at it. To be fair, I have seen many news reports of Microsoft working to take down bot nets, which are computer systems that are often used to send junk mail. Both of these companies are working hard (probably even collaboratively) to reduce the total amount of digital spam. 

If you created a brand new Hotmail account and a brand new Gmail account, and used them the same way in the same places, they would probably both have very similar spam behavior (not a lot for a while). Is your Hotmail account older than your Gmail account? Older accounts are much more likely to be spammed, since the older account has probably been used more.",eli5

Even with my 10+ year old Microsoft intellimouse I have almost pixel-level control. On a nice modern laser mouse I would have even more accuracy, and many of those have switches that allow one to change sensitivity on the fly, making the sensitivity low for things like sniping, or high when in high-action situations so I can spin around with just a tiny movement of my wrist.

Second, to win a claim of defamation, the person or organization filing the claim (the plaintiff) has to prove that there has to be some harm or injury done to the plaintiff by the defendant's defamatory statements.

However, I don't know enough about the mechanics to make a properly informed decision (yet).
Any good links would be really useful to read through and understand a little more.","An MEP is a person elected to the European Parliament. They have the power to vote on laws being passed in the EU, and European wide laws cannot pass without the consent of the majority. There is also a good chance the head of the EU commision will be appointed based off of the preference of the largest group in the parliament. 

Voting is important for two reasons: 

1. Whilst the EU parliament does not have as much power as Westminster with regards to their repective organisations, it still has some power. So voting is important because you get to pick who represents you. Its fundamentally the same reason you should vote in general elections. Brexit makes it matter less, but there is still the possibility we remain, so voting still makes sense (and if that possibility upsets you, voting for the Brexit party is a more effective protest than not voting)

2. You mentioned you were from the UK. In our case, who wins is going to be looked at and analysed with regards to Brexit. So the EU elections are a good opurtunity to express your wishes, and support/opposition to the government.


For voting for the right MP, I would reccomend looking for party manifestos to get an idea of what laws they would approve, looking at group memberships to get an idea of what kind of government they would appoint (Labour are the only major UK party in a group with any real shot at this, so its primarily vote Labour to back the S & D, or don't back Labour to ease the fight for the EPP), and looking at Brexit stances to see what kind of domestic message that would send.",eli5

Chandigarh was a pet project by Nehru to act as a replacement for the loss of Lahore during partition so it had central control.

2jcbmu,"Why is storing a hashed password any better than storing a plain-text password? I know its extremely bad practice to store plain text passwords in a database and I've never done it. However, I'm looking for the specific reasons as to why this is.

So maybe I can take a ""Explain Like I'm Slightly Older Than 5"" response, but I just don't get how holding the hash of a password protects the account from being accessed. If what you are inevitably comparing are two hashes, how is this process really more secure?","A hash is generated by taking the plaintext and running it through a one way encryption algorithm.  If the algorithm is correctly designed, it is very difficult to reverse the process and determine the plaintext that will result in a specific hash value, which means that it is very difficult for an attacker to use a stolen hash to figure out a password.

Since you aren't storing anything that can easily be reconstructed into the original plaintext password, and that original plaintext password is what the attacker needs to break into the system, it makes your system more secure.

If you store the plaintext password instead, well, the danger is obvious.  If an attacker gets the plaintext password, they have all the information they require to break into the system using that password.",eli5

11ct6z,"Why do opioids like Vicodin (hydrocodone, etc...) cause digestive issues like nausea and constipation? I'm stuck here on the couch with a broken leg, pain pills, and a whole lot of time. Teach me Reddit!","In the enteric nervous system, which is the portion of the nervous system that controls the digestive system, there are three types of opioid receptors - mu, kappa, and delta.  The mu receptor is mainly responsible for coordinating the movement of your digestive system.  When you take opioids, you stimulate the mu receptors, and throw off the coordination of muscle contraction in your digestive tract.  

Think of it this way.  You have a quarter full tube of toothpaste.  In order to get the paste out, you have to coordinate your squeezes.  Start at the bottom, then squeeze a little higher, then higher, until finally you get paste to come out.  If instead, you were to just poke the tube in different spots, you would never get anything out.   

So this overstimulation of mu receptors is like the random poking, and nothing can move very well in your digestive system.  Along with a few other factors, this will cause severe constipation.

Now for the vomiting: Part of it is due to increased stomach contents.  Why are there more contents?  Overstimulated mu receptors, which lead to poor movement along the GI tract.  Secondly, there are opioid receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the brainstem, which is responsible for nausea and vomiting.  Stimulating these receptors leads to nausea/vomiting.",eli5
36txrd,"Why is there no rain power? I live in B.C. Canada, on the coast, and we get our fair share of rain. I see scientists working on wind, solar, geothermal etc but never on ways to adapt rain to produce energy. I don't mean snow melt and hydro, I understand dams produce energy but i'm talking more specifically. Why are there no rain powered panels on the market? Ones where individuals could reap the benefits just like solar?
","Hydroelectric is sort of a form of rain power; it takes the water flowing downhill, either from rain or springs, and converts it to energy.

The fundamental issue is efficiency. For power to be efficient, you need to be able to concentrate a fairly large amount of it in a relatively small area (this is one of the biggest challenges with solar, for example). Rain is, by definition, spread out over a *massive* area, with fairly little energy falling on one particular spot. 

Hydroelectric works because it lets the landscape do the concentrating for us; instead of buildings huge ""rain power plants"", we let all the water flow downhill to a single point (aka a river) and then capture the energy of it falling there.",eli5

We started out ambushing them and stabbing them with spears, then following the animal until it died. This is obviously very dangerous and a lot of people were injured during these hunts. Eventually, we learned that we can throw the spear, which is a lot safer then running up beside a large animal and stabbing it. Just for reference, we think spears were invented over 500,000 years ago while throwing spears came around about 400,000 years ago. The next step was to add more force to the spear than we can provide through strength alone. The most basic way was to put the spear in a what's called a [Atlatl] (_URL_0_) aka spear thrower. 

The bow wasn't invented until around 64,000 years ago. Now you could throw a smaller spear with even more force from a farther distance away. Slings are also good for throwing a fast projectile from long distance, and can crack skulls. A quick search didn't give me a good date on sling invention, but both of these really improved our ability to hunt animals that are much stronger and faster than ourselves.",eli5

No disrespect to the PCMR or anything, I'm just trying to figure this out.","well.  first off.  that's not really true.  you can build yourself a $350 pc that can play all games just as well or better than the ps4.  since all the graphic/visual options are the ps4 are hidden from the user but they are all available on PC, you think that you are lacking something if you are playing the game at anything but max settings 1080p 60 fps.  also sony sells their hardware at a loss in order to get consoles into the market.  their plan is to make up the loss by selling games. 

this build is a little out of date.  but it's a pc build with similar or better specs compared to the ps4

If you think 3.4 is an unusual number, that's all (a).  There are companies that use 3oz bottles and companies that use 100ml bottles and 100ml = 3.4oz.  While the US usually ignores the existence of the superior metric system, the TSA is smarter than that.

25osjv,Why are some cars more reliable than others? Most people seem to believe that companies such as Honda and Toyota are far more reliable than Ford or Chevy. Why are they so much more dependable? ,"It would be nice to have a simple answer for this, but there honestly isn't one.  Narrowing it down to specific years, models, Engine choice, Transmission choice, Drive train configurations is a good starting point to begin to compare vehicles. 
 
I.E.  A 2001-2002 Ford Explorer's automatic transmissions are known to be not so reliable, although the V6 4.0L SOHC Engines they are mated to are known to be extremely reliable.  Problems start out usually because of unforeseen engineering problems.  Unfortunately testing these complex systems is very expensive and often they can get mass produced before the problem is identified.

When problems on newer vehicles (especially vehicles under warranty) get taken to a dealership for repairs, the mechanics will document the work.  Other sets of people including engineers will sift through that information and try to find the source of the problem.  The solution can often be a recall, where you take your vehicle in and they replace a faulty part, or sometimes they will just fix them at the factory for the next model years and sort of say ""screw it"" for all the vehicles that they have already sold.  Sad but true.

Some vehicles have a reputation of being 'bullet proof', which basically means they're really well engineered.  All makes have some extremely long lasting vehicles, and some really bad mistakes.  This is ongoing to this day, especially with all of the newer, unproven technologies that aren't totally yet mastered.

Researching online or asking any knowledgeable mechanic is a good way to avoid buying problem year/model vehicles.",eli5

4i39n7,Why do supersonic jets require subsonic airflow? ,"I am not quite sure what you mean specifically by requiring subsonic airflow. The typical jet engine requires subsonic airflow in order to work. Supersonic air causes a bunch of really strong shockwaves that can rip the engine apart as well as make it really inefficient when the engine is designed for subsonic flight primarily (aka all jet engines). The SR-71, for example, was special because the engines it had were actually two different engines. The first engine was a jet engine where the air had to slowed to subsonic speeds to be useful... but after it was going fast enough it switched to a RAM jet engine... which is where the airspeed in the engine actually needed to be moving really fast. The difference between a regular jet engine and a RAM jet engine is that the regular engine has a bunch of blades that compresses the air (makes it a lot more dense) and then ignites it for thrust. A RAM jet engine uses the speed of the aircraft and the air coming into the engine to do all of the compressing (so minus all the blades and moving parts). Just the fact that the air is being inhaled at such a fast rate and shoved into a smaller area does all the compressing... then it is ignited with fuel and it allows the aircraft to go forward even faster.

Then you have a SCRAM jet aircraft. And SCRAM jet is the same principle as a RAM jet... except the air moving into the engine is supersonic (which means in order to work you pretty much have to be moving at supersonic speeds to begin with).

What is interesting about all this is that actually the RAM jet and SCRAM jet... even though seemingly more advanced and allowing for higher speeds... are actually much less complex. They require very few (if any) movable parts compared to the Jet engine (and then interestingly enough... the jet engine is a lot more simple from a mechanical standpoint than a piston engine... aka a propeller aircraft). RAM jets and SCRAM jets are basically specially shaped tubes even though they allow for even faster speeds than a typical jet engine.",eli5

","Your heart seems to stop but its actually just changing how fast its beating. This feels like an abrupt pause if it happens fast enough. This happens many times a day, you just don't notice it most of the time.

The pain that comes is a result of the fear caused by noticing and misinterpreting the change in heart rate. You involuntarily contract the muscles in your upper body, and involuntarily inhale at the same time.  Since you're trying to do two things at the same time that are impossible to do at the same time, the result is discomfort.",eli5

The sensors in your eyes (rods/cones) get excited and signal to the brain they're seeing a colour/light. Even after the light has gone, the excitement in the sensor doesn't disappear instantaneously: it dissipates over the next while. How long it takes to dissipate depends on how bright it is,  That's why when you look at the Sun or look at a light bulb, you still see bright spots for seconds after you look away.

(Side note: there's a related effect, where the eyes/brain try to compensate for your retinas' stimulation, but end up *over*compensating and generating a negative image, called an [afterimage](_URL_0_). Vision is hard and your eyes/brain often get things wrong)

Anyway, that means that when you're looking at something fast-moving, the image of it hits your eye and then your eye sensors remain excited after that. When the object moves, they get excited by the new image, but there's still a bit of excitement left over from where it was last time. There aren't any discrete ""frames"" of vision, but everything ends up getting smeared together because your sensors can't dissipate the image quickly enough.",eli5

I'll give you examples of what i mean:

-In the Fallout series, bottlecaps are used as a coin because they are somehat rare but common. The civilization saif that was a good method of money. There's a mission in new Vegas that leads you to shut down a bottlecap maker in a soda factory because if the amoount of that money increases without control, the value of the individual bottlecap will plummet because there's too much of it.

-In a Clarence episode, the kids make the Clarencedollars have value so they can trade services and belongings, but when there is a craze, Clarence makes a ton of Clarencedollars, and because they're too many, their worth is close to none.

-It happened in some countries after WWII where they reproduced so much paper money that stacks of cash means practically nothing and kids used them as toy.

-The European Union has some countries with a unified coin, the Euro, which value is backed up by the European Union. An african country (maybe Zimbawue) has money bills that ascend to trillions, but they're worth like 20 dollars or so (not exact, but you get the idea) because is backed by a country with a weak economy and have billions of trillions of Zimbaweues dollars. Years ogo i went to Turkey, when a hamburger cost like 10.000 of their money, and i was shocked of how high it was but then they explained me (i was 8 years old) that the value of their coin was pretty low.

-The Debeers company is the most producer of diaonds, and they say they're rare but it's because they control their outcome to keep the prices up while they have stackaroos of diamonds to release.

-Even spices were used as money and a valuable thing because they were rare and people wanted them, as so did with gold. 

-If some apocalypse happened in the next month, civilization could say that old batteries have some ceratin value to exhange products and services.

When nose hairs are stimulated, or an allergen is encountered in the nose, other cells in the nose release compounds called histamines, which irritate those nerves that trigger sneezing. Histamines are also involved in mucous production and itching of tissues, so the burning you feel is probably a combination of the actual feeling of mucous being produced and the itching produced by the histamine.",eli5

White blood cells are like the artillery of the body.  They're a powerful force but useless on their own.  The ""brains"" of the operation are the antibodies.  They're what latch on to the foreign body and act as a spotter so the white blood cells know what to destroy.

This is what vaccinations do.  They give your body a ""test run"" using either something that looks like the target cell or inert versions of the target cell to let your body learn how to make the antibodies necessary to fight it when it's exposed to the real thing later.

andbvy,"Why is GDP growth the metric we use to measure the success or strength of an economy? Sure growth is important, but shouldn’t another metric be used? Say poverty rates, median income of participants in said economy, etc. Seems like worrying only about growth is what leads to inequality to me. ","To put it succinctly: all of these measure *are* used but GDP is the headline grabber because it changes frequently, and has strong predictive implications for all the other measures.

When GDP is growing rapidly, then that *usually* means that more jobs are being created, etc. When GDP is shrinking, or growing slowly, then that's a leading indicator that parts of the economy are in trouble.

But of course, as we've been seeing for at least the past decade, GDP can grow *very* unequally. The USA has decent GDP growth over the past decade, but the average American is actually less well off than they were a year ago, so you're correct to see that it's very misleading to assume GDP growth = better for everyone.

You're correct to identify that GDP doesn't necessarily tell you anything about wealth distribution or employment, which is why it's important to focus on other indicators as well. ""Gini"" is normally used for wealth inequality and of course the unemployment rate is a measure of workplace participation, although it's probably more accurate to look at the ""workplace participation rate"" since unemployment really measures ""how many people are looking for work"" rather than, for example, how many people have given up looking for work, or if women are not participating etc.

Long story short:

GDP is a good short term indicator of economic activity.

Gini or some other measure can be used to indicate income inequality (and it's bad)

Workplace participation rates are a good measure for... workplace participation.",eli5

Involuntary grinding is called bruxism. Stress is often the cause, although the use of certain stimulants may be causative or contributory.

If you're sure that you are grinding and that the symptoms are not caused by something else, you should try to reduce your stress levels - it's hard for me to give general advice about that because methods vary depending on personal circumstances. Also, reduce your intake of stimulants. If you're drinking a lot of caffeine, especially in the afternoon, this may be making the problem worse.

There are other things you can try: some people have reported taking magnesium, or using a warm cloth or heat pack against their jaw muscle to help it unclench before sleep. However, as someone who lives with a parter who grinds heavily, I would recommend targeting the source of the problem (stress and possibly caffeine) rather than trying to apply a band-aid.",eli5
9mv8ae,Why does dry ice squeak loudly when it is pressed against certain metals? ,"That's the sound of carbon dioxide making metal contract and expand quickly.  
  
[Longer explanation - There is a pressure drop associated with the increase in the speed of a fluid. The dry ice vaporizes into carbon dioxide gas when a comparatively warm metal comes in contact with it, creating a change in pressure.  
Because metals are good conductors, they transfer ambient heat to the surface of the dry ice. This increases the rate of vaporization of the dry ice. As more and more gas is created, it pushes through the points where the metal touches the dry ice, creating a pressure drop that draws the metal and dry ice together again.  As the metal is pushed up by the evaporated gas and drawn back down by the pressure drop, it will vibrate quickly enough to hear an audible noise. Reeds in woodwind instruments operate under the same principle. Depending on the conductivity of the type of metal, the frequency will be different.](_URL_0_)",eli5

15szol,"Why do I want to pace around when talking on the phone, memorizing information, etc? ","There has actually been a huge amount of research on this and it is pretty amazing the results. I will try and give the basic points and see if I can find an article later and I will edit it in.

Think about when you are talking to someone face to face. You have a huge amount of visual feedback, like their body language, facial expressions, and hand motions. So you are constantly getting those cues that convey different emotions. So you are basically bouncing these cues back and forth off of each other.

Now, when you are on the phone you don't have that visual feedback so your body has to do something to occupy those urges. So its basically like a hot potato that you can't pass on to anyone. So your body reacts by pacing, fidgeting, etc. Some studies have went on to show that you actually burn more calories while talking on the phone and pacing, fidgeting, or other unconscious movements than formal exercise.",eli5

Just wondering how bringing your knees up to your chest relives stomach pain.,"Something along the lines of: when you bend your knees up to your abdomen, it relieves the pressure inside your abdominal cavity that is causing the pain (usually triggered by the nerves in the lining of the abdominal cavity rather than from organs, themselves)

Edit: Textbook answer:

2s161g,How come Natives of Africa tend to have darker skin then Natives of South America who live in the same latitude? ,"It depends on what you mean by *natives*.  I take *natives* to mean persons who are born in the region, and in this case the *demographically prevalent ethnic group of the region*.  The explanation below has elements that can explain both.

A prevailing evolutionary hypothesis for why Europeans and northeast Asians developed light skin is that they needed it for vitamin D production.  In Europe, as well as in northeast Asia, there is a harsher winter and less sunlight exposure.  Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin with UV light.  However, dark pigmentation leads to lack of UV light, so vitamin D is not produced very well for people that have dark pigmentation in areas with less sunlight.

Modern South Americans are primarily descended from two groups:

1. Native Americans that came from northeast Asia about 15,000 years ago.  

2. Europeans (mainly from Iberia) who intermixed with these native Americans.  The isolated indigenous peoples will not have this admixture, but will still have the admixture outline in point 1.

Now, it is reasonable to expect that the native Americans who crossed the Bering strait would have developed pale skin.  Later relatives of South Americans would have had to survive in Canada and the United States before coming to Mexico and then settling in South America.  In Africa, the dark skin was able to develop over hundreds of thousands of years.  In the Americas, a likely pale-skinned population only had about 15000 years (short on evolutionary time scales) to change allelic frequencies to darker skin, and most of this 15000 years was likely to have been spent surviving either the Arctic, Canada, or the northern United States, resulting in an even lesser time scale for the frequencies to change.  Then, most of that population received admixture from another pale-skinned population (Europeans).",eli5

5kep53,Why can't bots check 'I am not a robot' checkboxes? ,"actually, clicking the box is a rather trivial part of what those CAPTCHAs are looking for.  What they're actually looking for are things like:

did the 'user' instantly move their mouse to the exact coordinates of the box, or did they traverse thru the page like a human would?  

is the user scrolling to the box, or are they remotely executing javascript to trigger a scroll to the box?

how long after page load did the user find the box? Too quickly is obviously a red flag, but taking too long is also. commonly, to get around reCAPTCHA you'll need to find out 4-5 areas to click in addition to the initial click. The way that most people do this is using CAPTCHA services, which are real people solving them and returning the answer to you (i.e. for a text captcha, you'd send them the image and they'd send back the letters/numbers).  The way you do this with reCAPTCHA is sending a screenshot of the computer, and you are returned the coords that you're supposed to click on to answer the question properly. [e: apparently this method is old, and a new method where the CAPTCHA is actually served up to the person within the service that will solve it for you!] However, it usually doesn't take a legitimate human 5 minutes to answer a few questions about 9 images.  if you take too long, they'll make you do another image check challenge.

basically, it's really, really difficult to make a bot move the mouse, scroll, and react naturally to a page load. and even if you do manage to fool reCAPTCHA, you'll be thrown to a few image tasks which may serve to block you out from the website completely, due to the reasons mentioned above.

e: as others have mentioned, this type of stuff is only part of what reCAPTCHA relies on to determine human/non-human - particularly, your referring information  &  whether or not you have a logged in Google account.

e2: there are a bunch of people claiming that mouse movement tracking is impossible to do. in chrome, hit ctrl+shift+j, paste
 > onmousemove = function(e){console.log(""mouse location:"", e.clientX, e.clientY)}

in, and hit enter. then move the mouse. it's easily done.

Senators are re-elected every 6 years, but it's staggered so about 1/3 of the Senators are up for election every 2 years.

This election is called a mid-term election because it doesn't align with the presidential election every 4 years.

Edit: This won't directly effect the next presidential election except that if the majority changes hands, it could affect the effectiveness of the President's policies.  Since the President doesn't have the ability to write laws (He can veto bills or sign/approve bills), he's dependent on Congress to send him bills that fit with his agenda.

Works for pretty much anything there's only usually so many ways to create something and they requires a particular order. Like a house of cards, destroying a house of cards can be done and massive amount of ways and unless they are elaborate they are usually easy and don't require a particular order.

Now what is interesting is if you aren't fussed about how you break a thing it's just a matter of energy and resources. 

But if you want to break something in a specific way then you'll start requiring energy, resources and creativity like for the demolition of a tower. You can just blow it up but if you want to demolish it with out killing anyone or damaging other things you need a very specific well thought out plan.

4ui52a,How do technicians determine the cause of a fire? Eg. to a cigarette stub when everything is burned out. ,"I was a fire investigator for 6 years. We go about finding what started a fire by A) looking at burn patterns and B) interviewing the people that were there if possible. 

If the whole house has not burned down, I look for the that has the most burn damage. In a urban area where the fire department is pretty responsive, you may only get smoke damage in most of the house. This rules out the rest of the house from starting the fire. Let's say the most burnt area is near the kitchen. You start asking yourself what can start a fire in that area. Usually this would be your stove, electrical systems, candles etc.  The next thing you would do is rule out each possible source of fire by looking at witness marks. These are distinct marks where the flames appeared to originate.  Eventually you will get to a point where you can conclusively rule out what definitely did not cause the fire and hopefully left with one source of the fire.  

It is not uncommon to sift through an entire room of debris to find common sources of ignition.  When sifting, we have found cigarette butts, arced wires, matches, and one time an 85 year old woman's stash of condoms.  If we believe arson was a possibility, we will take samples of the area for chemical analysis.  Arson is pretty obvious as it leaves what is called a ghosting pattern on the floor.  We can pull samples from the edges of the burn and test for gasoline etc. When it comes down to it, all fires need fuel, oxygen and a source of ignition.  This is called the fire triangle.  Our job is to look for the source of ignition. 

For those asking about forest fires, I was not in that type of work but I assume the same way.  I am sure they use an areal view of the area to determine the starting point and go from there.  

Edit*  I wrote this when I woke up without my contacts in so sorry for the grammatical errors.  Also adding some more details.",eli5

14nei4,Why public nudity should remain illegal? ,"In many places on this planet, public nudity isn't exactly illegal. For example, there is no law against a woman driving topless in California, in New York City it's legal to be topless and also you can be completely nude provided it's part of a ""play, performance, exhibition, or show"".

However, the reason public nudity is illegal (in the places where it is) goes back to Christian and Catholic shame and guilt. In Genesis, after they ate the apple, Adam and Eve were shamed by their nakedness and so covered themselves. This is basically the root of society's apparent abhorrence of human nudity. Jump forward several thousand years: America was founded by a Puritanical society at a time when the Catholics were in power in Europe, and the Protestant Reformation was just beginning. Regardless which side you pick, Catholic or Protestant, both societies follow the Bible which means we're all supposed to be shamed by our nakedness. This made its way into our laws where it survives to this day.

I know nothing about Eastern laws concerning public nudity, though, maybe someone else could chime in.",eli5
7dbzwo,"Why does insulin injection cause bumps of insulin, is it not delivering correctly? Been diabetic for 4 years now and I know that skin can become tough and resistant to insulin and that’s why it’s important to rotate injection spots which I do. I’ve noticed recently that when I inject; more commonly
In my arms and stomach; there will be a little bubble near the injection spot post injection. I’m assuming this is insulin 

1) why does this happen?

2) is my insulin delivering correctly? Or should I be worried

Thank you 
","Medical advice is best gained from speaking with your doctor, or your diabetes specialist nurse in this case. 

In this case it sounds to me like you're not depositing the insulin into the fat layer, but between it and the skin or even within the skin itself. Or are these bubbles basically a little bit of fluid leaking out? That could be interstitial fluid or the drug, or most likely a mix of the two. However, I can't really pass judgement because I'm not a diabetes specialist and I haven't seen you inject or what these bumps look like. 

The most important thing is- how is your glycemic control? If it's fine, and you're not having spikes in your blood sugar (or lows, for that matter) then it doesn't sound like it's causing too many issues. But I'd still make an appointment to speak with someone about it. Far safer than taking medical advice off a random person on Reddit.",eli5

","There's lot more that goes into it than just ""Someone committed a crime.""
First someone has to file formal charges. Then you have preliminary hearings to decide if there is enough evidence to require a trial. Lawyers will often spend as much time as possible gathering information and assessing the case before they enter a plea. In this case, Holmes' lawyers claimed that he was mentally unstable and that they needed time to asses his mental condition. There are often many court hearings as new information comes up. For Holmes, many of his appearances were postponed because he apparently injured himself attempting suicide. 

So basically as new evidence is found, they have a hearing and the judge tells them if they can use the evidence at the trial or not. The judge finally called for the trial in January 2013 and the hearing at which he would finally enter a plea was scheduled for March. Before the plea, the defense and prosecutions negotiate pleas/sentences. In Holmes case, the defense offered a guilty plea in exchange for the prosecution's avoidance of the death penalty, a bargain they did not accept. In June 2013, finally Holmes pleaded not guilty due to insanity. The trial was originally set for February 2014 but more time is needed for a possible psychiatric evaluation. Currently the trial is set for December of this year.

But it's not ""clear cut"". There is a long process of finding out what evidence can/can't be used in court, negotiations about sentencing and pleas, and in this case issues over the mental stability of the suspect.

In fact, you get rid of a good bit of bacteria just by rinsing, the soap just makes it more effective.

When you rinse veggies, you are physically removing the dirt, and maybe traces of pesticides (in the US, at least, there are rarely even trace amounts of pesticide; but just in case). Fruits and veggies aren't animals and the bacteria / viruses on them are not generally harmful to people. Even then, water washes much of it off.

The only time there's really a risk is when manure is when natural fertilizers (like manure) are used. Sometimes that may have harmful bacteria. That's not really a concern unless you buy organic. Even then, rinsing it off will get the majority of anything harmful off.",eli5

7glygd,Why Do We Get Eye Strain? ,"u/masterchief0213 is slightly wrong on a number of issues primarily concerning his point 2.

 >  The actual lens in your eye has to be stretched to change its focal point to keep things in focus

This is not how accommodation (the process by which humans view objects close to them) works. What actually happens is that the lens in the eye is held in a stretched position by a relaxed circular muscle attached to the lens via what are called zonules when viewing **distant objects**. This does not put stress on that muscle as it is relaxed when viewing these objects.

**To view objects close to you** that muscle contracts to relieve tension on the lens and allow it to become more compact and slightly more circular. This means it provides more power (a concept that allows for quantification of the ability of a lens to focus objects at certain distances) to allow the lens to focus on a closer object.

 >  especially as we age, it gets tired from doing this and it becomes harder to focus on close-up things.

This is probably also misleading in that there is little evidence to suggest significant loss in muscle ability with age. The process by which our near vision worsens has little to do with eye strain.

Eye strain can be related to accommodation or in short sighted people may be related to screwing up of eyes to improve distance vision.

Why isn't there a noise by pushing a denser medium (such as water) when sound travels better through dense media? ","In the specific case of air in a whistle and water in a whistle, the what’s actually happening is this: the shape of the whistle causes a rapid rise and drop in air pressure inside the whistle. This is the vibration — sound. In text form the pressure goes HiLowHiLowHiLowHiLowHiLow. 

Unlike air, water does not compress and decompress. Because water won’t compress, it won’t generate the same kind of vibrations — especially if you use the same whistle. In text form the pressure goes SameSameSameSameSameSame — no vibration here.  

If you picked a denser medium, but one that still compresses (say, sulfur hexafluoride) the whistle would still work — I would expect it to sound deeper.   

The difference here is not about how sound *travels*, it’s about sound *gets created*.

9fk8lf,Why does a recession follow full employment? ,"It's important to note how a recession is defined.  A recession is defined, officially, as 2 quarters (each 3 months long) where GDP declines.  Basically, a lack of growth = recession.

How can a business grow if there's no one to hire?  How can a business sell more if it's already selling everything it can make?  The inability to hire new employees is critical for growth and ""full employment"" means that there's no one out there looking for work.  So every employee is an employee poached from someone else.  So every business that grows because it hired someone is also causing some other business to shrink because it lost someone.

You want a small amount of unemployment because there needs to be some slack in the system so that people can get hired.  Say I'm laid off, spend 2 weeks unemployed and find another job.  That's a pretty good setup for me.  But for employers, they are limited in who's available for hire to a very small window.  In the case of zero unemployment, there are so many employers looking for workers that the moment I get laid off I accept another offer, spending zero time unemployed.

So there's always a group of people looking for jobs and a group of employers looking to hire.  It's highly unlikely that those 2 groups always are perfectly matched.  So one group or the other group are going to have some waiting that needs to happen.  Economically it's better for the individual if that waiting is on the employer's side, but for the country as a whole, it's better if the waiting happens on the individual's side.

That's why you end up here regarding full employment.  Most people look at it from their own point of view, lose my job and immediately get 10 other offers, sounds pretty good to me!  But they don't look at it from the employer's side.  Need to hire someone, everyone I offer the job to declines it so the position goes empty and my business can't grow like it should.",eli5

In Spain however, the word used to describe a similar rank (leader of companies of men) was *coronel* (which may have happened because *corona* is crown so *coronel* implies royal authority).  So the term *coronel* migrated to English, and the word started being pronounced according to English rules, which is where the modern pronunciation came from.  

Later, as European communication increased and military ranks were becoming more standardized the spelling was changed to better reflect the original Italian roots of the word, but the pronunciation was well established and remained true to the Spanish coronel.",eli5

5mz72z,How did Chris Pratt do the magic trick? (Link in description),"I watched it and figured it out. At 50 second mark he fans through the deck, he's looking at the top cards. He even slows down so he can see the top 3 cards. He then does a few semi false shuffles. The top of the deck is never mixed with the rest and always remains on top. When he splits the deck into 3 piles, the top is put in the middle and that is where he directs the other guy to take his card from. 

He already knows he is picking the Ace of hearts, the rest is just showmanship and entertainment. Shuffling doesn't change anything.

After Chris looks through the deck to find the Ace, he moves it to the near bottom of the deck. Probably an even position such as 6th from the bottom. Take note of the card burning. He reveals a card, it's not correct do he deals it to the table and burns a card. The burning is to hind the fact that the card dealt to the table at least once didn't come from the bottom of the deck so the A is now on the table. 

The showing of the 4 cards on the table, he shows a card, the 3 of clubs, false deals the Ace onto the table again, and burns the 3 back to the top of the deck. He shows another card. Then the last 2 cards at the same time to help hide that we already saw that 3 earlier.

66atno,"why we can't immunize against the bacteria that causes tooth cavities TIL that tooth cavities are caused by bacteria that we are not born with, but we aquire from others just like a communicable disease. So why can't we immunize for it or treat it with medication in the same way we treat other bacterial infections?","First of all, I read that same post on Reddit and it's BS. Yes, you aren't *born* covered in bacteria but it's very true that you depend on bacteria to live. Bacteria are on your skin. They are in your intestines. If you're a girl, they are all up in your vagina as well. And while they can sometimes make you sick, some of them are quite helpful to you. Bacteria are ubiquitous in the environment and they will colonize you no matter what you do. Yes, you might get your mother's when she kisses you the first time but you also get covered in bacteria climbing through the birth canal. They are on practically everything you touch to the food you eat to the air you breathe.

No, you do not get cavities like communicable diseases. While they can cause some diseases (endocarditis, abscess, certain types of pneumonia under the right conditions, infections from being bitten by other humans) brushing your teeth works pretty well just as bathing does.

Developing vaccines against them would not only be a waste of resources it would do very little to prevent cavities since your immune system isn't protecting your teeth. When you brush/floss and you bleed, your immune system handles them just fine on its own unless you have certain risk factors--and those *do* get antibiotics before dental procedures. And if you do get sick, endocarditis or pneumonia or otherwise? We give you medicine.

You also have to keep in mind, what would the medicine do? Antibiotics are in you blood and the bacteria on your teeth are not. If you want to kill the bacteria, you brush your teeth, but they are just going to come right back. Also keep in mind that antibiotics don't just kill the bacterium you want--they kill lots of other bacteria, too. And when you kill off the good bacteria, really bad bacteria can take up residence in their place and make you sicker. Additionally, frivolous use of antibiotics also selects for drug resistant bacteria so not a good idea.

TLDR: Cavities are not communicable diseases. The bacteria that cause cavities are generally handled by your immune system just fine, but your immune system is not protecting your teeth. Brushing your teeth periodically to get rid of them is a better solution than medication in a similar fashion to bathing regularly.",eli5

Is there an actual reason why film makers stay away from 60fps in movies?","Well, there's a number of reasons. One is that people are simply not used to it. The Hobbit came out in 48 fps and pleanty of people said it negatively affected their experience. Now if all movies started being at a higher fps, they would get used to it and it wouldn't negatively affect them anymore, but for now, because of that reason filming in 48fps might mean that your movie sells less. 

Secondly, fps is more important for interactive mediums (games) because of input lag. Having to actually move around characters yourself makes that low fps much more noticeable. Simply put, it's not as big of a deal for movies.",eli5

1zflpl,Can alcohol really effect individuals differently at higher elevations? What about THC in marijuana? ,"Alcohol yes, if you are not used to the elevation. Alcohol does lower blood oxygen saturation, which means that less oxygen is being carried to tissues throughout the body. High elevation does the same thing because there is less oxygen in the atmosphere. Drinking at high elevations would combine both of these effects. This would only occur within the first couple days of being at a higher elevation since the body will recognize that there is less oxygen available in the atmosphere and generate more red blood cells in order to compensate. People who live at high elevations will not be affected by this, but may have the opposite effect when going to lower elevations. 

THC no, because its affects have nothing to do with the cardiovascular or respiratory system, beyond the actual smoking of it. The change in atmospheric pressure is not likely to have much of any effect on the absorption of THC in the lungs.",eli5

61uqp5,"Why do we need sunscreen? Why do we need sunscreen if our ancestors spent so much of the day outside? Do I actually, as a white guy, need to wear sunscreen if I'm spending more than twenty minutes outside? ","Hi there!

I think I can help you answer this question. To start a little background into why some people burn and others don't, and skin color plays a massive role in determining this. Our ancestors who made their way out of Africa and in to Europe about 40,000 years ago developed a change in their DNA that turned their skin white. This change in DNA allowed European settlers skin to absorb more sunlight, thus allowing for more Vitamin D to be absorbed during colder months where less sunlight was available. This change in the DNA also made it easier for lighter skinned people to be extremely sensitive to sunlight and UV rays (a type of bad radiation which can damage this DNA). This should answer your question about differentiating our ancestors, who spent time outside because this is an important factor. 

Now, our ancestors did spend a ton of time outside, but for thousands of years these people died at a significantly younger age then the average life-expectancy today. Today, we are potentially exposed for double if not triple the amount of possible time than our ancestors.

With any type of radiation, such as UV, any exposure adds to your life time exposure and increases your chances of cancer. UV radiation, doesn't penetrate very deep like radiation from a Nuclear bomb so it mostly affects your skin and eyes. It is recommended to wear sunscreen daily like SPF 10-15 in a moisturizer, but as a fellow white male, I don't moisturize with sun screen every day. Look, if you are outside for 20 min you are exposing yourself to a type of low penetrating radiation but as long as you aren't spending your life outside or working outside for long periods of time annually, you have a better chance of dying in a car accident than dying from being exposed to 20 min of UV radiation and dying from cancer. 

Hope this helps,
Cheers!",eli5

8my1tk,Why do video games leave their rating as RP when everyone knows what the rating is going to be? E.g. Madden ,"The advertising cycle needs a lot of time and momentum to get going. As others have mentioned if the ESRB has not yet issued a rating for the game then the advertisers are legally not allowed to put anything other than RP for the advertising cycle. Now in a press release they are allowed to say ""we expect the game to be rated E or E10"" but they are not allowed to advertise the game as ""Rated E for Everyone"" until the ESRB has officially said, ""This game is rated E for Everyone."" This is especially true because sometimes the ESRB changes their policies regarding rating systems (I remember when E10 did not exist, it was E, T, M, AO, and now it is EC, E, E10, T, AO) so if, utilizing your example, the producers of Madden went ""Madden is rated E, always has been always will be. So we're just going to advertise Madden 20 as rated E for everyone."" Then in review the ESRB goes, ""We have changed our policies and all games with online multiplayer capabilities are now going to be rated E10."" BAM! That's false advertisement.",eli5

Hopefully my question made sense.","With the wins Paterno is once again the all time wins leader for college coaches at 409, without them Bobby Bowden at FSU takes it with somewhere in the 350's.

The NCAA was essentially saying that those games were won under ""false pretenses"" in that if everything had come out at the time recruits wouldnt have wanted to go to PSU and those games might not have been all wins. However the NCAA had very shaky legal ground to sanction the school at all as it was mostly a criminal matter. What is concerning is that there are on going criminal investigations and that there were people in the building who may have acted inapproriatley and they should face the consequences of their actions, but the evidence that Paterno was one is minimal at best, he told his bosses what he heard and then went back to being a coach, could he have done more maybe, but he never saw anything directly either like some did.

Think of the body as a compost pile, the inside will decompose much faster than the outside. It's a breeding pool for bacteria because of the furnace like containment. 

The insides will pull moisture from the skin making it into a leather like barrier thus intensifying the composting inner organs.

Now, if the dead person had multiple deep lacerations and wasn't cleaned up by a cosmetic mortician, the skin would indeed turn black much faster.

Eventually the entire body will turn into a black oily goo leaving not much left other than the thicker bone sections.

4zbr87,"What is a 'Calorie' and why do people worry about them rather than Fat, Carb and Protein? This may sound like a strange question, but what exactly is a 'Calorie' and why is that the preferred use of EVERYONE instead of what actually makes up those calories i.e. Fats, Carbs, Proteins 

EDIT:: Thank you for all the replies, makes more sense why it is the way it is now","Ok, so Fats (Lipids), Carbs and Proteins are all considered ""Macronutrients"", so called because you need a large amount of them to function correctly (relative to Micronutrients), but ALSO because they are the energy providing nutrients.

The key here, is that they all provide energy; your body has an engine that uses this energy, and a system for storing excess energy (turning macronutrients into fat cells for storage) and a ""calorie"" is a measurement unit of this energy.

A gram of Protein = 4 calories, a gram of Carbs = 4 calories, and a gram of Fats = 9 calories.

People worry about calories (and this continues to be both a popular and hotly debated topic today) because weight gain and weight loss is based off the calorie equation. Putting it extremely generally, the calorie equation says that if theres more coming in than is being used, you will gain weight because that energy will be stored (turned to fat).

Do note that this all concerns an individuals fat levels; muscles weigh more than fat, and as such you could be losing fat, but still gaining weight. The point is people are trying to lose excess fat, and so they worry about the calorie.


EDIT:

Going a little further, a specific food's calorie total does not correlate evenly with hunger satiation; a simple example is like I said below in another comment, 800 calories of rice is easy to eat and will leave you hungry in a couple hours whereas 800 calories of broccoli might be damn near impossible to eat in one sitting, and leave you full for a while.

Thinking about it this way, we are able to separate the ideas of calorie amounts and hunger satiety as two separate aspects of a food, and this is important when dieting (and choosing the right foods to eat in regards to energy concerns). So long as you are keeping within a certain calorie budget you set for yourself and are decent satiated hunger wise, it doesn't matter if the foods you eat are primarily comprised of carbs, fats, or protein. (in regards to fat loss. It definitely matters for other reasons related to health concerns, if you don't have a balanced macronutrient diet)


EDIT:

Going even further, you mentioned something about arbitrary calorie totals, and your concern is correct in that regard. Every individuals calorie needs are different, and setting an arbitrary calorie budget for yourself (the famous, arbitrarily set daily 2000 calorie limit for example) is unlikely to work. The point of the calorie equation is that you need to set a budget, work with it for a while, and see if you're losing weight or gaining weight. Then you can adjust the amount of calories in your entire budget from there to get a feel for how much calories you personally may need.

EDIT:

I should also say that this explanation is purely about calories and energy which is what OP seems to be concerned with; there is a whole other side to the diet where you have to worry about getting all the micronutrients you need (vitamins, minerals, etc), and so therefore you can't just eat tree bark your whole life :)

However, while its easy to understand the point of ""we need to eat healthy foods and not 'empty' junk foods"", many times the calorie and how energy intake management works can be convoluted. Therefore I focused only on calories and energy in this post.",eli5

Also, APA format has been around longer than computers, and citation-managing software specifically. Nowadays, you can automate citations in a word processor and auto-adjust the numbering pretty easily. But back in the day of typewriters and early word processors, if you wanted to number things you had to *manually* number things. So if you decide to add in another reference later, you would have to manually re-number *everything.* And if you're working with 30, 40, 50+ references... you get the idea.",eli5

The CO2 dissolves into the water, filling in pre-existing gaps between the water molecules and reducing gas pressure without significantly increasing the water volume.  Shaking the jug briefly and dramatically increases the surface area of the water to accelerate the process.

7uie95,"Why a mother's allergies or autoimmune diseases antibodies don't get transmitted through colostrum to its newborn, but the rest of the antibodies do? ","Not all antibodies are the same. Colostrum is mostly IgG, IgA, and IgM. Allergies are usually IgE mediated. IgE generally causes a very strong response, and is used in fighting parasites in a normal animal. 

Generally IgE is located in tissues and is very reactive (skin and lungs especially), and is very low in the blood. Colostrum gets antibodies (and other stuff) from the blood, so since there isn’t much to begin with it doesn’t get into colostrum in meaningful amounts.

Autoimmune diseases aren’t always due to autoantibodies, but those can be transmitted. I can’t find much evidence that it causes disease, but it could. However, colostral antibodies don’t last forever. Generally they get cleared after awhile and the individual’s own immune system takes over.",eli5

While reading a textbook my mind tends to drift and i begin thinking about completely irrelevant things but i keep reading even though i won't remember it at all when i re-read it.,"Our brain is really good at automating mundane work. It is very tiring for the brain to actually ""think"" about what it's doing, and can't be sustained for long periods of time. But what the brain can easily do is learn over time how to do stuff without thinking.

If you drive for long enough, you know how sometimes you just ""black out"" and just don't remember how you got somewhere. This is especially true when you're thinking of some big problem / planning something while driving.

Like if you drive somewhere new and running conoversations with your ex in your head, trying to plan out your next phone call to your crush or just thinking about homework - and suddenly find yourself arriving at your workplace. And you don't even remember how you got here because ""your brain wasn't the one driving"", and wasn't paying attention to the route because it was busy (obviously it was your brain, but not the conscious / intentional parts of the brain).

Same with reading. Your brain automated the ""turn text into sound I can listen to"" part. And like while driving - the brain can now do it while thinking of other things.

So now the automatic parts are just ""reading to you"", and like when someone else is reading to you - you can get distracted, daydream etc. and just not listen.",eli5

49hkar,Why do some words and names sound 'funny' whilst others don't?,"THere are two reasons a word/name sounds funny to you.

The first reason is the cultural norm. A name like Jake for an American sounds perfectly normal since its really compatible with English and is commonly used so you're use to hearing the name and there is a standardized way of pronouncing the name. A name like Phuc can have multiple pronunciation because there is no standardized way of pronouncing it in the U.S. (but there is in Vietnamese) and you don't commonly hear it. 

The second reason is that the word/name is not compatible with the language. Some words just cannot be adapted to the correct pronunciation in English so there is compensation which sounds 'funny' to the ear. Vietnamese is a tonal language so its almost impossible to have the name Phuc pronounced correctly in English, a language with little tonal requirements.

8qf12y,Why does baking soda cure canker soars?,"It doesn't cure them per-say.  

But the canker sores are typically infested with bacteria that like acidic environments.  Likewise, the pain receptors exposed by the sore will react from acidic things.

Baking soda is a basic compound, which means it will neutralize acid, which may both help with killing off bacteria keeping the wound infected, and more immediately, remove the stinging pain every time you poke at the sore (until your saliva eventually lowers the pH back down).

You can get the same effect by chewing up a Tums tablet (calcium tablet) in your mouth and swishing it around over the wound.  It might sting for a second, but then pick and prod at it all you want - you won't get that sharp shooting pain.",eli5
416re4,Why do our eyes water when we choke on something? ,"Because you have certain reflexes which are designed to protect your airway. There's a nerve supply, the internal laryngeal nerve which is sensitive to everything touching your epiglottis inwards and down into your airway. You need to defend your airway very carefully because if anything goes in there it could threaten your ability to breathe properly.
 
There's a very profound choking reflex and that triggers a cough. It also triggers various secretions to happen, the idea being that it will lubricate your mouth and anything that's stuck will get free. At the same time the same secretery, motor system also make your eyes water a bit. It makes tears come to your eyes and also what you're doing when you're coughing and choking you're blowing air up your tear duct. Normally the tears that you've got in your eyes drain down little punctum which is a little plug hole in your lower eyelid towards the middle. They go down towards the naso-lacrymal duct and tip into your nose. 

If you raise the pressure in your nose by coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose the pressure is reversed. It pushes the tears back up your tear duct and into your eye. There's two things going on. One – you increase the secretions and two you probably jettison some tears back into your eyes.",eli5

2v0e7r,"Why do my prescription drugs cost MORE with insurance? Apologies if this is a dumb question, but I'm a college student and don't quite understand these things yet.

I just tried to get two prescriptions filled at my campus pharmacy.  With insurance, the cost would've been $75 for one rx and $30 for the other, totaling $105.  Thankfully the pharmacist noticed the drugs were cheaper without insurance and didn't run them, so I walked away paying only $45.

This whole situation left me really angry.  Being in college means that money is very tight and I'm very strict about what I spend.  I thought the whole purpose of insurance was to SAVE money, but instead they wanted me to pay more??

I really want to know why this stuff happens.  If anyone has any answers please help me out.","Pharmacist here. The thing about the cost of drugs without insurance is that it is usually up to the individual pharmacy/pharmacist. Independent pharmacies will usually have more reasonable prices because they'll charge based on the cost for them to obtain the drug. For example, I might charge $10-15 for something that costs me $5 to obtain. For big retail chains, they usually have a policy to just charge the AWP price. For example, even if the drug cost $5 to obtain, the pharmacist would still be forced to charge something ridiculous like $50 or $200 whatever price it says in the computer which may or may not be updated. 

Now why your meds cost more WITH insurance also boils down to your individual insurance plan and could be for several reasons. I've seen some plans that charge the pharmacies and then pass the cost onto the patient. Example would be a drug that costs $10. Insurance charges the pharmacy $10 and charges the patient $30. The pharmacy ends up making $10 profit here but they could have made the same profit by simply charging you a lower price of $20. Why insurance companies do this I have no idea.

Another reason is that the negotiated price for the drug with the insurance companies might not be that closely related to the cost. This goes back to the ridiculous AWP prices some drugs have when compared to the actual cost. Drugs that cost $5 might have an AWP of $200 or something like that. The contracted price will usually be something between the AWP and the actual cost, maybe $75 for this example, so if you have a copay, you would pay a portion of this much higher cost. If your plan wanted you to pay 33% of the cost, you would end up paying $25, compared to the $10-15 I stated earlier that an independent pharmacy would charge you on a $5 drug.",eli5

I think regulators eventually stepped in, limiting the time they were allowed to float the funds.

4ip084,"How does frakking cause earthquakes, but detonating nuclear weapons underground....nothing? I really don't understand how we have exploded nuclear weapons all over (and under) New Mexico and Nevada and somehow have not caused major detrimental issues to the surrounding areas.  ","Detonating nuclear weapons underground ABSOLUTELY causes an earthquake. If you're standing fairly close you'll feel the ground move, and seismic detection systems will trigger all over the place depending on how big your bomb is. That stress is created all at once, and they don't continue to cause earthquakes afterward though unless the cave that they carve underground collapses sometime later... and they try to avoid detonating them where they can trigger other earthquakes too. Nevada and New Mexico are big empty deserts so they're perfect places for testing - California with its big fault, not so much.

But fracking gradually changes the earth's substructure by pumping in fluids that crack supporting rock to release its petrochemicals, and then extracting those petrochemicals. The result is a massive change in the integrity and strength of fairly big areas of the layers of rock underneath you as well as the fluids that support those rocks and all of the ones that sit on top of them. Like pulling blocks out of the bottom of a Jenga tower, this can cause collapses that lead to tremors. 

If there are already faults with their own underground stresses in the area, or slightly unstable layers of rock above them, it can lead to triggering those faults as well because the nature of the supporting rock nearby has changed. So it could create an outlet place for some earthquake-causing force to be released. Suddenly those stresses have a place to release, and boom, small tremor.",eli5

People are complaining that they made her character weak because she was put in the ""damsel in distress"" situation by being captured and needing to be saved. The reason the writers did this was because ScarJo was pregnant, so they had to find a way to get her out of some scenes, and that's what they chose.  
  
The other main complaint is that her romance with Banner kind of came out of left field, and it definitely comes off that way in the movie. However, Whedon had to cut a full hour out of the movie, yes that does mean it was supposed to be 3 1/2 hours long. I'm willing to bet that extra hour set up their romance a little better, along with a bunch of other small gripes people had.",eli5

That, combined with the addition of a romantic subplot annoyed people who liked that for once, a female lead in a film didn't need a love story to be cool.
 
Oh, and the line about being sterilized got interpreted by some fans to mean ""Because I can't have kids, I am a monster."" Instead of as ""I can't have kids, because of the horrible things they did to me, which resulted in my being a monster.""

Accepting cancer rates are rising due to known carcinogens, but we rarely know exactly which ones isn't satisfying.  Understanding cancer rates are rising because people are living longer isn't satisfying.  

Basically conspiracy theory fulfills two basic needs, feeling smarter than other people and replacing uninteresting work i.e. studying a dry subject with interesting work e.g. studying aliens.  

If you don't like the explanation for something you can explain it however you want and be outraged at whoever you want.  That's appealing to people.

Written Danish and Norwegian is kind of similar. Spoken Norwegian is closer to spoken Swedish.

Going to Norway I can make myself clearly understood if I speak slowly and articulate well.

If I try the same in Denmark, they’ll immediately switch to English because we have better understanding of each other using a third language than using either of our own.

It’s kind of the same with Icelandic. It sounds similar. You have a constant sense of understanding that is...frequently undermined. But in reality it’s easier to switch to a language we have in common instead of pretending until it gets absurd.

When he realized the people was coming, he ordered police to stop them, but there was too many people. His solution was to ask his brother-in-law (or father-in-law, cant remember) to stop them..

And that was the fuck-up, because the brother/father-in-law was the regional leader of a drug cartel called ""Guerreros Unidos"" (""United Warriors"") who kidnapped the normalists, asphyxiated and killed many of them, drove them to a city dump, and then burned them, some of them maybe alive. Also, the leader of the students was shot, the skin of his face removed and his body thrown to the highway.

Some days ago 6 bags with ashes appeared near the city dump, seems like are the student's.

EDIT: Officialy the students're still missing, until they can be sure that the ashes found are from the students.",eli5

5ytog4,What goes on in our mind and body when we meditate and why some people hallucinate when meditate for a long period of time? ,"Our brain uses a lot of unique tricks to interpret our perception of the world around us. Our eyes for example can only see details in the very center of our field of view. The rest of your sight is good at picking up movement quickly but not detail. The reason you don't notice this is because your brain filters through the information from your senses and fills in gaps where needed.  (This is also why you don't see a big blur of motion when you move your eyes from object to object, your brain knows that the motion is useless and removes it from your conscious perception)  A lot of optical illusions trick this part of your brain by getting it to fill in images that seem illogical. In the case of meditation (or maybe you are thinking of sensory deprivation tanks?) in the case of a lack of incoming stimulus, your brain is still trying to fill in gaps in your senses. With nothing for it to references, it fills in randomness that we interpret as a hallucination.",eli5

5882gw,"How and why do hard drugs drastically change a person physically ? In all aftermath pics, the drug user ends up looking horrible with scabs, anorexia and overall a near completely different face!","As Snewzie alluded to, it's mostly about what the drugs do to a person's behavior that changes their physical appearance.

If someone smoked meth or became a coke addict and continued to eat healthily, get regular sleep, exercise, and maintain social bonds, their appearance would not degrade in the same way.  (Over time, methamphetamine does also destroy the teeth and gums.)

Unfortunately, hard drug addiction does not allow for healthy living.  Sleep goes by the wayside, food that might be spent on good food instead goes to drugs, and then of course there are the ""bug"" sensations which literally cause some users to pick at their skin and face until they have many open sores.  Intravenous drug use also lends itself to infection, collapsed veins, and ""trackmarks.""

If a sober person didn't sleep, ripped their skin to shreds, and became severely malnourished, I can't imagine they'd look much better than a drug addict after a few years.  Most sober people don't engage in such activities because there are literally no benefits to doing so.",eli5
82pe1h,Why was Prohibition passed as an Amendment to the U. S. Constitution?,"We underestimate today just how passionate the issue was.  Alcoholism was a bitter, pervasive, and constant influence on society, far beyond the imagining of people today.  Because the indirect victims were so often women - beaten, raped, cheated on, or impoverished by their husband's addiction - the Temperance movement rose right alongside the Suffrage movement.

So on an emotional level, they didn't just want a political decision, they wanted a national statement at the very highest level of consensus.  They wanted to avenge beloved family members who died from alcoholism, to avenge their own ruined lives at the hands of abusers, and to build a society that was safer than the chaos they experienced.  And they tended to be very religious, and saw it as a mission of their Christianity.

On a more practical level, the Supreme Court in the early 20th century was generally skeptical of federal authority in peacetime, so a statutory ban might not have been upheld on legal challenge or might have been reversed or diluted by political fickleness or corruption.  

In which case an Amendment *allowing* the federal government to ban alcohol might have been necessary, so if they could get such a thing passed, they might as well pass an Amendment directly banning it.",eli5

1eshx9,"Why is there such strong opposition to same-sex marriage in France? France just legalized gay marriage, but the opposition to it seems much stronger than in the US. A few months ago at least [300K](_URL_1_) people attended an anti-gay marriage rally in Paris (scaled up to the US population that's the equivalent of 1.5 million, about the number who attended Obama's 2008 inaugural). Then today a [French historian](_URL_0_) became the anti-gay marriage version of self-immolating Buddhist monks.","I'm French, living in France. From what I see and hear, I think there is not such a strong opposition to same sex marriage. There is opposition, one can't deny it. But it's not that strong. What is strong is the focus the media has on it. While it is a matter people easily and peacefully discuss, the bill is a project from the socialist government we have since François Hollande's election. This government is often criticized for his lack of action and for delaying promises made during pre-election campaign. So the media keeps the focus on the same-sex marriage by giving speech time to opponents and supporters. But supporters don't walk the streets with signs, so news-worthy show here. Then we have opponents, who give real news material, and the result is this: everyone can see how the government's action is strong and changing our lives judging from reactions of opponents. So what everybody here thinks (Hollande is a lazy little man, promised things he won't do), is ""proved wrong"". Foreign media copy-paste french news, so the world thinks some pretty intense shit is going on in France about ""le mariage pour tous instauré par François Hollande et les socialistes"". That's just not true. Opposition exists, as for much other things, but what makes it so visible is that opponents are mainly conservative right-wing lunatics hungry for some tv appearences, opportunist politicians that grabbed the matter and put their troops on the streets.

9fzlps,What causes enclaves and exclaves to form? ,"Do you mean like political exclaves and enclaves of one country in another?

It's the same reason any other border or boundary forms, and it's different in each case. For example:

- the town of Baarle-Nassau has loads of enclaves and exclaves between Belgium and Holland. That's because those countries in that area formed around the holdings of various dukes. The town contained lots of properties owned by the Duke of Breda and Duke of Brabant. Breda's stuff ended up as Holland and Brabant's stuff as Belgium. 
- Büsingen is an enclave because what is now Switzerland used to be a lose confederation of microstates and city states. Some of these joined Germany (or its predecessors) or Austria and some banded together over time as Switzerland. Schaffhausen and Büsingen both originally joined then-Germany (the Holy Roman Empire) but Schaffhausen was then able to get free and later joined Switzerland. Büsingen wasn't and ended up trapped surrounded by Switzerland by Schaffhausen. Then later when they voted to join Switzerland Germany said no because Switzerland didn't have anything to offer them in compensation.
- Nakhchivan is an enclave if Azerbaijan between Iran and Armenia. It's the result of Soviet policy and ethnic reasons. The whole area had a mix of Azeris and Armenians separated in part by ethnicity and in part by religion. The Soviet Union had a policy of giving each ethnicity its own country while making them all part of the Soviet Union in order, they hoped, to reduce tension. They neatened up the borders and lumped together all the areas that were ""mostly"" one ethnicity even if the split was often 60-40 or what have you. That resulted in three countries: Armenian SSR, Azerbaijani SSR and Nakhchivan SSR. Then at independence the two bits with an Azeri majority (Nakhchivan and Azerbaijan) joined together. 
- Nahwa is a double enclave, part of the UAE surrounded by Oman surrounded by the UAE. Basically around 70 years ago the tribes of the area, who didn't really have any affiliation with any country, were sounded out to ask if they'd like to join the UAE or Oman. Most of the tribes joined the UAE, but one Omani ambassador was particularly persuasive and persuaded tribes in one small area to join Oman. But then there was one village in the middle of that area where the chiefs had family ties to the UAE and so they went the other way.
- Kaliningrad used to be a city state Königsberg founded by Teutonic (german) knights who founded a number of trading ports around the Baltic They all became part of Germany as did Poland. After world war 1 the bits in between Königsberg and the rest of Germany were ceded to the new independent state of Poland to give Poland a coastline but Germany got to keep Königsberg as a historically teutonic town. Then after world war 2 the Soviets invaded Königsberg chucked all the Germans out and then asked if they could be allowed to keep it as they wanted a Baltic port and this one was going spare. At the Potsdam treaty the world said yes
- Campione is a bit of Italy surrounded by Switzerland. When the surrounding area of Ticino voted to leave Italy and join Switzerland this village said ""nah we're good"" and so wasn't included.",eli5

55btcs,"Why do dubbed voices in movies sound dubbed? Voices in the original language always sound like part of the film, but dubbed voices always sound overlaid or with a different combination of mood and crispness. So what difference is there in the equipment (mics, software, etc) and voice recording procedures studios have that dubbing companies don't?","The best dub work is done during production - this way the studio can simply remove the native dialogue track, but keep the ambient sound, music, etc, and add in the new (dubbed) track. Post production dubbing is the worst, since the studio basically adds new dialogue over the existing audio track.

Even with the best dub work, it will still be obvious for several reasons. The most obvious is that the lip movements don't match the words. Another is that the voice doesn't fit the actor. Another is that the actor doing the dub typically is the cheapest actor the studio could find, so the delivery of the line won't fit what the actor is physically emoting. It could also be a cultural phenomenon, where some languages are less subtle than others, so it sounds to you like the dialogue is over-dramatized, while in the dubbed language it's perfectly normal.

It's not that the dubbing studio doesn't have the right equipment, it's that they don't have access to the raw video edit, nor money/motivation to hire quality actors. And they can never overcome the fact that the lines will never match the lip movement.",eli5

Animals didn't develop eyes because of a need, it just happened and turned out to be beneficial. 


Due to random evolutionary changes, a single called organism probably created a protein in their structure that could sense light. The best way to image what this would be like is close your eyes, and look towards a light source. They couldn't see but they could tell where light was coming from. This was beneficial because these organisms lived in water. Light was more visible near the surface where there also tended to be more food to eat. So these organisms had a way to find the surface, and therefore food. These species thrived, passing on their gene for this light detecting protein which eventually became eyes.",eli5
3a22db,Why are we not supposed to use phone cleaning apps? ,"For one, Android uses an SD card for file storage rather than a traditional hard drive. SD cards are a type of flash memory — similar to solid state drives — and don’t need to be defragmented. In fact, one of the downsides to flash memory is a limited number of times that data can be written to the card before it expires. By defragmenting an SD card, you can decrease its lifespan.

When you clear apps from RAM, Android is just going to load them into RAM again the next time it needs to access those apps (for notifications, updates, and other background details). This is actually slower for you since SD cards are slower than RAM.

4rxqt8,Why water when frozen gets bigger in size even though the molecules are technically getting more compressed? ,"Ah! Water is a 'special case'. It forms a spacious crystal lattice as it freezes, and so actually increases its volume. 

That means that the atoms within the water molecule connect to the atoms in other water molecules in a pattern or design that takes a lot of room - not very compact at all. 

As a bad example - but it gives you an idea, imagine the volume of a box of toothpicks. Now you glue the individual sticks together, one on each edge, to form cubes. The cubes would take up a lot more space than the box of toothpicks. 

With most substances, this transition leads to a more compact arrangement, but not with water. However, once water is frozen, then it, ice, does contract when cooled further, but still not enough to be more dense than water. 

Not many substances do that. This turns out to be extremely important in the evolution of life, since it keeps lakes and oceans from freezing solid, since the ice forms on the top and becomes a sort of insulation from the cold air. That allows fish and other living things to survive in the depths..",eli5

up7yn,What lossless music is and why I should care (as opposed to a regular mp3). ,"**Technical explanation:** The more you compact and condense audio information into a smaller filesize, the more audio detail you lose, particularly in the high end and low end. Think of it like a jpeg becoming gradually more grainy and blurry as you decrease the quality of the compression and lower the filesize.

**Practical explanation:** Assuming you don't have crappy headphones or a crap sound card, do an experiment some time.

Download an album of classical music or something without much noisy instrumental to it (so no heavy metal or dubstep) in the lossless FLAC format.

Then listen to the same songs but encoded at a standard 128kbps mp3 format. The FLAC will not only have more clarity, but more atmosphere to it (depending on how it was recorded).

It doesn't make a difference for all types of music, but if I am listening to something like the OST for Skyrim, you bet I am going to prefer it on a lossless codec such as FLAC or at least 320kpbs CBR mp3. Anything less and you start to lose details in the music. If the instrumental is grungy and noisy to begin with however, it becomes more difficult for each instrument and aspect of the song to be lost with the audio data being taken out.

It also makes little difference when recording singular things such as the human voice.

The downside to lossless is that the filesize is much bigger, which is why the current standard is a relatively low quality one. The smaller songs are on average, the more songs a company can claim will fit on their mp3 players.",eli5

As various powers gobbled up various areas they became local ""Guineas"". ""Scramble for Africa"" The country of Guinea was French Guinea, the country of Guinea-Bissau was Portuguese Guinea, Equatorial Guinea was Spanish Guinea.

There are only 4 countries with this name, I wouldn't consider that a lot really. Guiana and Guyana are not associated with Guinea in any way. It's only a coincidence that they look similar. Guiana/Guyana aren't etymologically related to Guinea; the name Guiana or Guyana comes from one of the indigenous languages of that section of South America.

Also, a big chunk of West Africa was known as Guinea by Europeans so when it split following colonialism, you got the named based on which area a particular european country took. For Papua New Guinea... Locally, the island is called ""Papua"" -- hence Papua New Guinea.",eli5

3ct97j,"Why do so many video games reload the entire level when you die or load a save, even if you end up in the same place? I've wondered this for years. With a handful of exceptions, when you load a save in a game, it needs to reload the entire level as if it was doing so for the first time, even if you'll end up standing in the exact same place. I know it has to reset enemies, environments etc. but isn't most of that in memory already?","Former game dev here,

One possible explanation is due to code reuse. Part of that program is written to load a level given a number of parameters, which constitute your game state. The game saves your progress through a series of checkpoints which is no different than your save file data. So when you die and need to go back to your checkpoint, reuse the same code, which reloads the whole level as though it were the first time.

Reloading a level by reusing resources already in memory is additional code that has to be written and maintained, and it's error prone. It's extra work when you already have level loading code that ostensibly does the same thing. Now you have to determine if what you have in memory is the right data, which might be information not encoded in the data, so now you need to be able to do that, and then you need to take inventory of what you have vs what is needed, and then you have take inventory of what parts of the data need correction, then you have to load the stuff that's missing. And what if this behavior is invoked for another level that isn't in memory? It gets messy. Lots of bookkeeping. It's safer and easier just to blow the whole thing away and start over with existing code that has been thoroughly tested.",eli5

Is it something to do with the variance in snow and rain? Temperature/the sun?","The effect /u/PhillipthePenguin mentions plays a role. But I think the more important factor is that buildings in warm climates are more often made from materials like mud brick, adobe, or rammed earth, which are typically white-washed to give them a protective coating and a nice even-looking color. A white-washed building provides a nice ""canvas"" for cheerful painting.

The reason these materials are common is because they provide a lot of ""thermal mass."" This means they warm up slowly during the day, and release warmth throughout the cool nights common in many warm climates.

So, my question is, what are the reason for the Delayed aspect of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness?","There are a couple of reasons, but the most basic of them is that your body becomes inflamed. Inflammatory processes happen in your body when something needs fixing. In this case, the muscle fibers need fixing (it is good to note, muscle fiber destruction or micro-tearing isn't directly correlated to soreness, but that is the general principle). Inflammation isn't an instant process. Think about someone who gets hit really hard in the elbow. The pain is nearly instantaneous, but the elbow probably looked the same until a few hours later, when the inflammatory process had moved more blood and repairing enzymes into the area to help it heal. This is what happens with your muscles on a smaller scale. Also, generally, the bigger the muscle group, the longer it takes for ""peak soreness"" to take place.

This means that stuff happens that the camera can't really capture. Because it doesn't record *everything* the wheel of the car does, sometimes we end up with pictures that are misleading.

So let's pretend we're watching the little tire valve on the car's wheel (where you put air in), and the car is moving from left to right. We see the valve go from the top, to the right, to the bottom, to the left, back to the top, and so on. Up, right, down, left, up, right, down, left, up, right, down, left:

    Up Rt Dn Lt Up Rt Dn Lt Up Rt Dn Lt Up Rt Dn Lt Up Rt Dn Lt Up Rt Dn Lt Up Rt Dn Lt

Now say the camera's taking pictures at a speed that results in it only actually seeing every third one of those; here's what the camera would see:

    Up       Lt       Dn       Rt       Up       Lt       Dn       Rt       Up       Lt 

Woah! Up, left, down, right is what you'd see if the wheel were turning the *opposite way*! So, then, when the video is played for us, it looks to us like the wheel is spinning backwards.

This also explains why they look like they're spinning slowly as well as backwards.

That's just an example. Depending exactly on how fast the camera takes pictures and how fast the wheels are turning, sometimes the wheel just looks like it's turning slowly but in the right direction. Sometimes it can even look like the wheel is standing still!

Even though we have phones with high processing power and multitasking features, why can't the software system  allow multiple apps to be downloaded and installed at the same time. I believe this is already possible in iOS devices.","It doesn't because there's no good reason to. It hasn't got to do much with processors, installing mainly is unpacking and moving files around. Installing 10 apps at the same time means they all have to share the limited disk writing speed that is available, and so they all will go 10x as slow, possibly even slower due to overhead. 

Installing the same 10 apps sequentially means that there's 9 less installer programs running and accessing your storage, making your phone run smoother. There's also less chance that the installation has to wait to gain access to parts of your system in use by other installers or apps and there's less chance for errors, since the phones developers can assume that there's always only one app installing at the same time.

j6j1a,"Explain diet soda/energy drinks and how it's lack of calories effects weight gain and loss (like I'm five) I really don't understand the workings of diet drinks, so explain away!","When you eat food, your body uses all the sugar and vitamins in the food to make organs like your heart and your brain work. Your stomach sorts the food into sugar (it can even turn the food into more sugar than was in the food!) and vitamins, and all your guts sort them even more. Your guts make the sugar and vitamins go into your blood, and your blood moves like a river in your body. It goes to all the organs and gives them everything you got out of the food.  

Sometimes, people eat too much sugar. Since your body has enough sugar for all the organs to work, it turns it into fat. Fat is like a body's cookie jar. If you can't get enough sugar some day, your body will reach into the jars and turn the fat back into sugar so your organs will keep working. But some people don't like how the fat looks on them, and a lot of fat can make you very heavy and hurt you in a lot of ways. 

Since sugar is what turns into fat, if people want to get rid of fat without eating less food, they'll eat foods that don't have sugar. Really smart people know how to make food that *tastes like sugar*, but isn't really sugar. Your stomach and guts can't turn those foods into sugar because it's fake, so you end up saving fewer cookie jars as fat or even have to use them up. That way people can eat foods they think taste good without saving up too much fat.  

But then, how do they make something taste like sugar, but it's not sugar? It's all about your tongue. Your tongue tells your brain what things taste like by using lines called nerves. There's nerves all on the inside of your tongue, and the ends are all along the top. They're really small, so you can't see them.  

When you eat something, the different tiny pieces of the food hit the nerves. Sugar tastes sweet, so all the nerves that like sweet tell the brain that there's sugar, so you know it's sweet. Other nerves tell your brain if it's spicy or sour and other flavors. The reason that different nerves like different things is like when you have different shaped holes and blocks that you push into the holes. The square sugar matches with the square hole for sweet, so that's how the nerve knows it's sweet.  

What the really smart people did is learn how to make things that matched the holes, but weren't sugar. They trick your brain into thinking it's just like sugar, but it's fake stuff made by the smart people. They put the fake stuff in the food instead of sugar so that people who don't like having a lot of fat can have sweet foods, but without the sugar. That stuff is called ""diet"".  

""Energy"" stuff is very different. It has A LOT OF SUGAR. It has a lot of sugar because it ""energy"" is like food and sugar for your body. You drink energy stuff when you know your organs and muscles will have to work very hard, so they need a lot of sugar to make sure they don't stop working.  

Some people lie and pretend that a food or drink is ""energy"", but it doesn't have sugar in it. It has vitamins that are good for you, but if you're eating lots of vitamins already, your organs are working fine. Those fake energy things help people who *don't* eat enough vitamins. If you don't eat enough vitamins, your organs and muscles can't use the sugar in your blood right, so even if you have real energy stuff for the extra sugar, it just floats in your blood or turns to fat because your organs and muscles are messed up. Those fake energy (or vitamin) food and drinks are for people who aren't eating and drinking stuff that has vitamins *and* sugar.",eli5

5friys,Why teenagers and young adults naturally want to stay up late and sleep in late?,"Melatonin, puberty, and maybe artificial light or sex!

Children generally respond to light exposure (sundown), but will also produce melatonin after being awake for 12-14 hours. The pubescent body is transitioning from 10-12 hours of sleep to 8 hours of sleep and from dependence on external controls (light) to dependence upon purely internal cycles.  What impact artificial light has on teens is not fully understood, but studies have shown modern urban teens to begin melatonin production as late as 1am.  

Some anthropologists speculate that this may have been selected in our species as teens who stayed up after the tribe went to sleep produced more offspring.  But we don't know enough about pubescent melatonin production to know if this occurred in pre-Industrial teenagers.",eli5

Why the omissions? ","There's only so much room on a DVD, and you want your local regional release to make the most of that space.

Some marketing person probably looked at the box-office sales for the movie when it was in theatres and saw that it did well in the UK, France, and Germany, and so bundled the languages for those relatively close-together countries onto the DVD.

If they wanted more languages, they'd probably have to either bump off some bonus content, or in the case of a TV show have 1 less episode per disk and have another disk in the set, adding cost and potentially raising the price point past what someone else would want to pay.",eli5

B) Don't go for preventative care. This means that instead of going to their doctor and getting the $50 prescription for a cold, they wait 6 months and go to the ER to get $5000 treatment for respiratory failure.

2c05on,"Why do wall chargers seem to charge iPhones faster than computers, xbox... etc My Xbox and computer seem to charge my phone much slower than the standard wall charger. Why is this?","To add to the other replies, current (measured in amps) is drawn by the phone rather than pushed by the charger, and the rating of the charger is how much can be drawn before it shuts down/overheats/burns out.  

By default, the phone will only draw a low amount of current (should probably only be 150mA to allow for USB 1.1, but it's generally 500 mA). The charger has a way to signal to the phone that it's able to give more current (connecting the data pins together, putting a resistor across them, etc.), and then the phone will draw a higher amount, generally 1 to 1.2 Amps.

Most phone manufacturers have settled on a de facto standard, but Apple decided on a proprietary standard so an iPhone charger won't charge an Android device quickly, and vice versa.",eli5

3ib42c,"How come cats get stuck in trees and need to be rescued? Could they get down on their own given enough time? Do they enjoy being up there and just choose to not come down? Or do they truly need to be rescued? If a stray (ownerless) cat climbs a tree, will it die of starvation by not being able to get down on its own? Or would it eventually find a way down? Just seems strange that a cat would instinctually climb up a tall tree when startled or chased without having the ability to get down.","Cat claws are designed for climbing up. A cat is not a squirrel.  Squirrels can climb up, down, and sideways, always headfirst, no problem. But a cat has to climb with her head up to avoid falling, and once she’s up, the only way down is to back down.  A cat that's exhausted, scared, or injured can't make that climb, and sometimes the cat just has trouble figuring it out.

There have been cats that have eventually become too weak to climb down, and even after being rescued, have died later of the effects of starvation, dehydration, or exposure.

We don’t see cat skeletons in trees because Kitty becomes too weak to hold on, lets go, and falls.  If the kitty were to actually die in a tree, they'd be picked apart by scavengers, insects, and then wind pretty quickly, and what was left wouldn't stay intact or in a tree very long. How many bird skeletons have you seen in trees?  Truth is, skeletons just don't last long up in the elements.",eli5

bjv4l2,Why did these metronomes eventually sync together? (see video) [_URL_1_](_URL_0_),"When they are started, they have a net momentum.  Over time, the momentum is redistributed until each metronome has the same amount.  They are coupled together by the board, and that's placed on the almost friction-less beer-can rollers.  Each metronome has the average motion fed into them through their base, and this adds or removes energy to sync them up.  Any excess is lost to air friction and any shortage is made up by the metronome's spring.

9c6wk7,How come my reflection on a spoon is upside down?,"This is a tricky question, because your reflection isn't always upside down. Only if you look into the concave side of the spoon (and if you're sufficiently far away).

For a super simple understanding, think what happens to light as it leaves the top and bottom of your face and reflects off the spoon. Think of the concave side first. Light rays from the bottom of your face hit the bottom of the spoon and get bounced ""up"". Light rays from the top of your face hit the top of the spoon and get bounced down. So the top of your  face gets bounced down, the the bottom gets bounced up - leaving you upside down by the time the light gets back to your eye!

If you looked at the other, convex side, the light rays from the top of your face would be bounced back and upwards, and the light rays from the bottom of your face would be bounced back and downwards. This keeps you upright.

The warmer it is, the more sensitive your tongue is to tastes. The colder it is, the more tastes are dulled. When warm, your buds are excited and more are engaged to send signals to your brain which in turn helps you perceive food as sweeter/bitter. 

Now from a cooking perspective, heating food can release more of the food's aromatics. Breaking down proteins, releasing vapors and juices affect the way food smells and by association how it tastes. The two are very intertwined. A pizza fresh out the oven tastes better than one out the fridge because we can smell the fresh one as it's radiating all these flavors.",eli5

4iaje3,"Why does it feel like it's easier to have negative thoughts rather than positive? Also, why are we more attracted to negativity - violence, drugs, and vices?","I'm a doctoral candidate in clinical psych and a therapist, so here's my two cents on this phenomena. *Please remember that this information is a generalization based off of existing research and observation of humans--there are always exceptions to any rule.*

One thing I often tell my patients is that we notice negative events more often because the positive stuff is happening all the time. Think of it like bad reviews on Yelp. Most of the time, if you had a decent experience somewhere, unless the experience was *exceptional* you're probably unlikely to post about said experience. Whereas if something bad happened, you definitely want to tell the world, right?

Secondly, negative emotions are associated with the release of a lot of different neurotransmitters and hormones, such as cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline). Both of those stimulate our nervous systems to enter fight/flight mode--this is a heightened state of arousal. Generally speaking, positive emotions don't put us into fight or flight mode unless we perceive something as a threat. 

This is the same reason that we are more inclined to remember nightmares rather than dreams. Nightmares release the same chemicals and wake us (very quickly) from sleep.

All of that said, as to why we ""seek"" risky behaviors, that's all human nature. If you tell a kid ""no"" to something, what are they going to try and do? They'll find a way to do it. It's quite possible that this is because we like adrenaline rushes (and that's why adrenaline junkies exist).

Lastly, violence, drugs and vices are not usually seen as negative experiences by the people who partake in them. Mostly because they are getting some positive reinforcement from their brains--usually a flooding of dopamine (the feel good neurotransmitter).

**TL;DR: Good stuff happens more so we don't always see it and being bad makes us feel good sometimes (like sneaking cookies from the cookie jar).**

5spv7s,Why can't we go back in time?,"This is an unsolved problem in physics. Really.

The mathematical equations that describe physics generally work just as well backwards in time as they do forwards, so it's not immediately apparent why time only goes one way. If a system would do *this thing* going forwards in time, you can just flip the signs and infer that it would do *the opposite thing* going backwards in time. 

This sort of thing is at play in the claim that going faster than light would take you backwards in time. That's one way of interpreting the math, but it may not really have any material meaning if it's impossible to accelerate anything *to* the speed of light, let alone past it (doing so would involve an infinite amount of energy). 

The single-direction nature of our movement through time is known as the **arrow of time**. It's connected to the second law of thermodynamics - the idea that entropy always increases. But for a more fundamentally satisfying ""why""? Good question.

34hv8i,what is different about all the blood types? What happens if somebody gets the wrong blood? ,"Blood types are simply the shape of the proteins that reside on the surface of our red blood cells. Some people have the A type of protein, some have B, some have AB together and some have none of these marks, so they're labeled 0. The bloodtype has little to no known effects on our inner body balance, but things change when you're to receive a blood transplant:

Our immune systems are trained to identify which molecules belong to our body, and attack pretty much anything that do not belong. So, if you're blood type A, you have the protein type-A in your body and your immune cells do not attack your own red blood cells. But were you to receive a B or AB-type accidentally, hell would break loose.

Having never seen them in your body, your white blood cells do not recognise a B-type protein and start attacking it with full strength. The antibodies stick to the surface of red blood cells and bring them down to the bottom surface of your blood vessels so that they can easily be swallowed by immune cells.

But, red blood cells are MUCH larger than viruses and bacteria we face daily, and the clots they form on our vessels soon block them. You lose blood flow, and the clots they form damage your delicate organs.

When this condition develops, death can occur, in a painful way.",eli5

The 28 minute delay isn't so much a problem as it is signal strength/quality. Rosetta and Philae are over 500 million km away from Earth - at those distances it's very very hard to transmit a clear signal that can be picked out from background noise.

One of the ways we combat this is by setting the transmission rate very very slowly.

If you don't have several thousands of dollars to lose you shouldn't be investing in individual stocks.  Any single company could have all sorts of things go wrong with it and you would lose everything, that you cannot afford to lose.  

 > and their stock would go up as a result, right?

Not really no.

A few thousand people buying one share is irrelevant to the share price.   The way you should be buying into google (or anyone) is by buying into a mutual fund that has several tech stocks.  You get a tiny piece of the larger pie, but you're not stuck to a single company. 

 > Or do they not want that for some reason?

They want to drive away hordes of small investors who have no meaningful portion of the company.  1 million investors with 1 share each are only worth a billion dollars, which is less than 1% of the value of the company.  That's a lot of paperwork for basically nothing.  Particularly if they're  highly volatile and trading small numbers of shares around.  


 > please explain if this is not the case

Different companies have different strategies, particularly when it comes to stock splitting. If you feel there are enough shares available, or if you feel that you stock is so expensive as to even be pricing mutual funds out of the market you may need to consider a split, unless you only want long term investors.  Cheap stocks can see a lot of trading volume from people trying to get a few dollars a share here or there. 

Berkshire hathaway (warren buffets company) is the example of strongly resisting - to a point of excess.  Their share price as of when I type this is 174 000 USD per share.  Yes, 174k.

Then there was the arbitrary designation of the Greenwich meridian (passing through Greenwich observatory near London) as the latitudinal reference of choice.
