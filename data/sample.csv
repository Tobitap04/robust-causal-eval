27uxdo,"How in cold weather, we are able to see our breath come out white, how come we do not see this when we fart? ","This answer is going to sound facetious, but bear with me. We generally don't see our farts in cold weather because our assholes are a lot tighter than our mouths.

Why does this make a difference? Well, because gas that is forced through a small opening expands rapidly, and rapidly expanding gas cools down fast. Want to test this? Find what's called ""canned air,"" then spray it on your arm. Just a quick blast but, wow, that was cold, right?

That's because all that air comes out under pressure through a tiny opening, then expands rapidly and cools down.

Same thing with a fart -- gas, under pressure, through a tiny hole, it expands rapidly and cools down.

Meanwhile, as you exhale through your nose or mouth, you're pushing air, not under a lot of pressure, through openings that aren't all that small. End result? Warm, moist air comes out, doesn't expand rapidly, and hitting cold dry air makes the water vapor in it condense, which makes it visible.

This is the same principal that creates contrails behind airplanes -- hot gas is coming out of the engines, but without being compressed upon exit. Voila -- visible trails behind the plane.

If you pursed your lips really tight and blew, you probably wouldn't be able to see your breath, either.",eli5

b1gkfd,Why do mobile apps get updates so frequently? Some of the apps literally have updates in 2-3 days. What is it that they are adding to the app so frequently? Is it not possible to have delayed updates that are larger in size?,"A few reasons.

1) It's very easy to update an app, even for small changes. A day's work could solve a lot of problems, and just a few button clicks sends it out to everyone

2) Apps potentially have much smaller dev teams than a lot of other software. This cuts down on the bloat and allows them to push through updates a lot faster

3) Phones are *fragmented*. Especially on android. It's unrealistic to try and test for every phone out there, but they all work very differently and a lot of different issues come up. These can be minor, or totally app-breaking issues that you were completely unaware of.

This totals up to a situation where big flaws can come up for a section of users, that can be fixed quickly, and can be pushed out easily.

So if you've managed to fix a problem for some users, there's really no reason to hang on to it just for a big update later.

Most of these fixes are fixing problems that you might never encounter, and might not even be *able* to encounter if they're device-specific issues.

Of course, quick and easy fixes *might* lead to more problems for other users... but that's a whole other thing. A lot of times it really is pretty simple, if you've got a simple app, to just quickly identify an issue and be pretty well-assured that fixing it won't cause other issues.",eli5

98jybr,"Why can my aches and pains ""reset"" by doing more exercise?","By reset, I assume you mean a brief yet acute dulling of pain. This is due to something known as exercise-induced hypoalgesia. As the muscles start aching, they activate the pain related nerves in the body, known as A-delta and C fibres. This pain is alleviated by two main mechanisms, Gate Control Theory and Descending Inhibition. According to the former, if other touch receptors are activated, it activates inhibitory neurons, which will in turn inhibit the pain. This explains why rubbing the injured area might lessen the pain. But our focus here is on the latter. So there exist in the brain certain areas, PAG and RVM, which have high levels of natural opioids i.e. endorphins. These opioids, using serotonin as a transmitter, are projected into the spinal cord, alleviating your pain for at least 20-30 minutes after exercise. So when muscles start paining during exercise, these endorphins are activated.   


This exercise-induced hypoalgesia is characterized by an increase in pain tolerance, and reduction in pain intensity during and after exercise. In effect, it resets the aches and pains.

Women tend to be more buoyant than men because they have a bit more body fat, percentage-wise, than men, and fat is less dense than water.

614p98,"Why does the word ""occur"" get a second 'r' when adding the -ing suffix and why does this happen with certain words? I googled this and found nothing so have mercy mods and AutoMod.

Basically 99% of words stay the same when adding -ing at the end, and when there is a change it's usually something that makes sense like changing a y to an i or something along those lines. Adding an 'r' doesn't really make sense to me though.","So, usually in English writing, an ""-e"" following a vowel/consonant pair leads to the first vowel being pronounced long.  For example:

""Cur"" [kur] v. ""Cure"" [kyoor]

""Rat"" [rat] v. ""Rate"" [rayte]

""Tap"" [tap] v. ""Tape"" [taype]

""Cap"" [cap] v. ""Cape"" [caype]

When you add an ""-ing"" suffix to a word ending in ""-e"", it generally replaces the trailing ""-e.""  (E.g., ""shape"" becomes ""shaping."") 

Which means that, if this were the only rule, you couldn't tell whether the ""-ing"" is just tagged onto the end or is replacing the ""-e,"" and you wouldn't know what the root word is.  (E.g., if someone is ""kiting,"" are they flying a kite, or getting someone's kit together?)  

So, generally, when ""-ing"" is added onto a word without a trailing ""-e"", the final consonant is repeated.  It's a signal that the root word ended with the consonant.  

So, for example, if you tap something you are ""tapping,"" if you tape something you are ""taping.""

""Occur"" follows the same rule. If you obscure something you are ""obscuring,"" and if something occurs, it is ""occurring.""",eli5

1t7yme,How can I see fire? And why do the colors change depending on temperature? ,"Seeing fire is no different than seeing any other light source, whether it's the actual source of light, or reflected light from an object.  You may as well ask why can we see, which is a wholly different subject.

Now as to the temperature vs color... there is some truth to this, but flame color it is more complicated than just that.  There is how complete the burn is, how much oxygen premixing there is, what material is burned, and what light is absorbed or emitted by the chemicals when burned.  It's not directly temperature related.

A good example of a fire that is hot, but there is no color, is a methanol fire, like you see in the pits at Indy or other car race some times.  All you see is the heat eminating from the fire, and the charring of the suits or the bodywork.  There may be a *very* faint flame, but mostly, it's an invisible fire.  Here's an example:

1wlr09,Why do the ends of fingernails turn white? ,"I disagree with the answers previously posted.  They are all talking about moisture/bloodflow/oxygen which is not a factor.  The fingernail is already dead matter, it is not alive.  There is no bloodflow to the nail itself, only to the nail root.

It's because your fingernail is not transparent, it's translucent.

Think about a frosted glass window.  It looks white.  Because of the limited light that passes through, you see more of the white reflected light.  But when a beautiful woman presses her boobs up against the other side of the glass, more of the skin-colored light gets reflected off her boobs and through the glass.  Therefore where her boobs are touching the glass, the glass will look boob-colored.  Where her boobs are not touching the glass, the glass will look white.

If you break your nail off, the entire thing will appear white immediately.  There is no drying out.  As soon as something pink isn't touching the other side, the nail will no longer appear pink.",eli5

2oetg0,"Why does beer taste so different on nitro? Draft beer on nitro tastes very different than the same beer on regular draft or from a can. How does it work, and why does it taste different? (Bonus question: Is there any reason to put a beer on nitro other than the different taste?)","Beer on nitro - either on nitrokeg or draughtflow cans - has very little carbonation, which makes the mouthfeel very smooth. Carbonation is dissolved carbon dioxide, which actually adds a small amount of acid to the beer, and makes the mouthfeel prickly.

The faucet for nitrokeg is different because it's a special type specifically for making that dense, creamy foam that Guinness is famous for. A number of other beers (not just stouts) are served that way also.

Nitrokeg is really an imitation of beer served by hand pump (aka beer engine). Beer served through a pump passes through a ""sparkler,"" which is a cap on the end of the faucet with tiny holes in it. In order to emulate that, beer on nitrokeg is pushed through a restrictor plate, a piece of steel with only a few pinholes in it. This restrictor plate is what makes the characteristic head. Because the holes are rather small, you have to push the beer harder at the keg to get a decent flow rate. If you used all CO2 for that level of pressure, the beer would be massively overcarbonated (because CO2 dissolves in beer much more readily than nitrogen does), and would gush in the glass. In short, nitrogen is used to push the beer because high pressures are required to pour the beer through the equipment that makes the foam, not because the nitrogen causes the foam itself.

You can give any beer a creamy head by pushing it through fine holes. I've done this myself, by building an ersatz beer engine. This uses a hand pump to push beer through fine holes I drilled in a brass fitting. I've also heard of it being done by just drawing up beer in a syringe and squirting a needle-stream back into the glass. Both of these are done without dissolving nitrogen in the beer; it's the turbulence that makes the dense, creamy foam.",eli5

1cd4a9,Why linux-based OS are supposedly less susceptible to virii than Windows? ,"two important reasons

First of all there are just fewer viruses are programmed that target Linux. this isn't so much a feature of Linux itself being more secure, just a consequence of it being less attractive for criminals to try and attack. There are more Windows systems in the world than Linux systems. Its a bigger target.

Second, Linux has a different user permissions and security model than Windows. In Linux all of the most important commands require permission from a special user named _root_. in a properly configured system _root_ isn't actually an account belonging to a particular human, its an account reserved for system level operations (like permanently installing new programs, making permanent changes to system memory resources, and accessing the operating system kernel). 

A human user will have their own account and can gain temporary permission to act as if they are _root_ if necessary, but activating that temporary permission requires entering a password. If the virus program doesn't have the password to gain _root_ permission then it just won't be able to do much damage. This isn't to say that there aren't Linux exploits and security vulnerabilities, just that the way the system is designed is pretty good at containing the potential damage that can be done from a compromised user. As long as the password for _root_ is secure the system should be able to recover from a virus pretty easily, with the worst consequence being some possible loss of specific user account data, but not a corruption of the whole system.",eli5

4tie4h,How does vacuum insulation (like in a Thermos) work? Why is it so good at keeping things hot or cold? ,"Heat travels in three ways, convection, conduction, and radiation. 
Convection is from an air or fluid flowing over the object. Example: the steam coming off tea, or when you open a hot oven and feel a blast of heat on your face. 
Conduction is from the two objects (one hot and one cold) physically touching each other to transfer heat. Example, how an egg cooks when it hits a hot griddle, or how you burn your hand on the stove. 
Radiation is from energy carrying particles hitting the object. This can travel through a vacuum and is how the sun heats the earth. 
By putting a hot or cold liquid in a thermos, you are preventing two of the three methods of heat transfer. You prevent convection because it's sealed so no flowing air goes over it, and Conduction because there is no matter in a vacuum, meaning there nothing touching so the heat can't transfer on touching things. Plus most radiation is blocked by the thermos not being clear (most common form of radiation heating is light). So you are slowing down heat transfer like how shutting down lanes of a road slows traffic.",eli5

1fc26q,"why some people want to get rid of the Federal Reserve Why do they want to do this?  What problems does the Federal Reserve cause?  Would there be problems if we got rid of it?  Do any other countries not have the equivalent, or used to and got rid of it?  Basically, I am trying to figure out whether this is a good idea or not.","The Federal Reserve is considered to be a ""central bank"". Other countries have their own central banks much like the federal reserve.

First off, you have to understand that most currency (US, Canadian, etc...) are based off of fiat money.  That is, your money is not backed by anything ""real"" other than the guarantee of the government.

This allows the central banks to effectively create more money when they require it.

The central banks have a mandate to keep unemployment low and to stabilize currency (keep inflation or deflation as constant as possible).  In essence, they try to maintain economic growth in a country.

So the tool they usually use to do this is by controlling the prime interest rate.  The Federal Reserve can loan money to financial institutions at low rates (because hey, they can effectively print money).  By controlling the interest rate on that loaned money, they try to affect the rate of inflation.

Right now, since the financial crisis in 2008, they have kept the prime interest rate near 0.  Their one lever to manipulate the economy is maxed out.  They can't lend out money at negative interest, because then they'd essentially be giving away free money.

So they have started a program called ""Quantitative Easing"" where they are actively BUYING debt. So say a private bank needs some cash, and is willing to sell bonds or assets to get that cash.  The Federal Reserve will now buy it to increase the cash flow in the economy.

So effectively, the Federal Reserve manipulates the economy by printing money.  By either lending out money at the prime interest rate, or by doing something totally new called Quantitative Easing.

The argument against this, is that no institution can effectively do this. And that their actions may actually hurt the economy in the long run. The economy is an extremely complex system, and no one truly understands what the ramifications of their actions are.

Also, there is a notion of unfairness that is occurring. All of a sudden, banks get access to cash that is almost interest free, to loan to the rest of society at a higher rate.  While at the same time, because that cash is ""printed"" from nothing, it hurts everyone else.",eli5

For the sole purpose of choosing a president, shouldn't we just have a tally system (Count up all the votes, the person with the most votes wins). I see answers that basically say the founding fathers thought it was best for the states to decide who the president should be. Assuming I understand that right, is that still the best system in today's world? Objectively, the constitutional framework aside, I still can't reason why a tally system is bad policy. ","It is designed to not let big states' interest control the entire election. The top ten states control just over 50% of the population despite being 1/5th of the nation. Yet 46% of the electoral college. So it's still heavily in favor of the big states. No individually california is 13% of the population while it's only 6% of the electoral college so I guess on that level it makes sense
each state has state based interests so while the top ten are 50 percent of the country they also aren't. Florida and California both have oranges and could elect someone promising orange subsidies more easily than the states that need corn subsidies. However corn subsidies are more important to the nation so it's in our best interest to give some smaller states at least somewhat of a fighting chance.

My impression is that the deal with an endowment is generally that it's set up so that it's invested, and operating costs are paid out of the interest - so if a school takes 16 million a year to run (pay the staff, upkeep, insurance, everything) and has a 32 billion dollar endowment, that's 1/2,000th of its funds - meaning they'd have to be making 0.5% of their investment back annually.

bxvvrq,"why is it easy to cross your eyes, but almost impossible to have each eye point outwards (left eye looks left, right eye looks right)? ","Our eyes are designed to follow a straight-line path to an object (which is called *looking at it*). The reason our eyes narrow is that they're a distance apart, so the closer an object is to you, the more extreme of an angle they need to turn relative to each other in order to focus on it.

That's the obvious stuff you can observe just by feeling how your eyes move when you look at something. The trick is the reverse: objects that are extremely far away. 

Let's take the sun. It's a fantastic example. Light radiates from it in a sphere. However, we are so far away from the sun that all the light that strikes the earth (and especially your eyes) is basically moving parallel to itself, since the aiming from that distance had to be so precise. If you follow the paths the light took back to the sun, your eyes would wind up nearly parallel with each other. And if you looked at some hypothetical object infinitely far away, you'd *have* to be looking in parallel lines in order to see it.

There is no situation on earth where you can see something more clearly by having your eyes turn any further outward than that. Any attempt would necessarily mean you lose all the benefits of binocular vision (two eyes facing forwards).",eli5

There is complicated hormonal processes going on, cortisol regulation being one of the most prominent ones. When we sleep these processes are ""tidied up"" and the balance is restored. Cortisol for example is directly influencing the metabolism, the heartrate, your stress levels, your general feel of exhaustion. When the metabolism doesn't work anymore we, bluntly, die. The sickness from not sleeping is the beginning of your body shutting down.

If it helps think of working nonstop in a kitchen that gets messier and messier by the minute. 

As long as you will keep working in that kitchen it won't get any tidier, stuff will be everywhere and working in there will take longer and longer since you have to look for things or clean your knife before you can use it again.

Of course it makes sense that they hurt, but the pain level is way off from the relatively innocuous nature of the conditions. I mean, I've accidentally cut off my fingertips and it still didn't hurt as much as a canker sore, and even the tiniest splinter is absolutely agony.","Hands, feet, the face, the mouth and the external genitals have a very large number of nerve endings that give a high level of the sense of touch in those parts. Other parts of the body are a lot less sensitive. Some internal organs sense no physical pain at all. It's pretty easy to see why the body has evolved this way: a good sense of touch in the hands and feet is required for climbing trees, peeling fruit, working with tools etc., and being able to accurately feel and taste what you're chewing on can also be the difference between life and death.

And once humans started bathing regularly, in the early 20th century, we started noticing smells more.

Here's an interesting experiment. I've experienced this myself, seen it in others, and it's even been on television and the like. You take a smelly thing, and you start huffing it. After a couple minutes, the intensity of the smell deminishes until you know you're inhaling the sent, but you can't smell it anymore. Your body does this for you, so you can ignore the regular smell of your environment, and be able to notice the distinguished smell of something new, like a predator.

People wash regularly, removing the regular smell. Now, when it's there, I notice, and I don't want to have to endure the stink of another fellow until the smell goes away.",eli5

2qp778,"Why was the Tog Gear crew attacked in Argentina? I don't understand why the crew had such a 'dangerous' time and were told to leave.

Edit: Yup Tog Gear. ","In 1982 Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which are British Territory. To a large extent they invaded for political reasons.

The Argentinians called the Falklands ""The Malvinas"" and there is a long history behind this and ownership of the Islands.

The British armed forces arrived and defeated the invaders, however since then Argentina every so often rattles the chains about taking the Islands back. For example : _URL_0_ - There are lots more articles and quotes, especially from Kirchner who is their former President, at the time she was battling various domestic issues and it would seem she was trying to divert attention from them.

Anyway, in certain areas feeling and emotion runs deep about the Falklands.

Top Gear turned up with their cars, the number (or license plates) seemingly significant to the war - for example one of them was H982 FKL. 982 obviously referencing the 1982 conflict.
Debate rages as to if this was done on purpose - Top Gear claim it wasn't but personally, I don't believe them. I think the plate was done on purpose, but they didn't realise it would land them in so much trouble.",eli5

15t8r4,The Louisiana Purchase. How did we keep track of the borders if they were so far away and no European people lived there yet? ,"The Louisiana Purchase wasn't worded as a modern border.  France laid claim (from New Orleans) to the entire watershed of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, west of the Mississippi.  (The eastern half was taken by Great Britain in the Seven Years War.)

France had numerous trading posts and forts across the region, but not much settlement beyond that.

Border control between Louisiana and neighbouring territories was non-existent. France would build forts or posts on rivers (which were by definition within their claimed territory) and, unless at war, would try to keep their military within the borders.  Private citizens could mostly go where they wanted, as long as they paid the required taxes upon arrival at whatever their destination was.

In fact, there had been almost no European exploration in the upper reaches of the Purchase area, which is why Thomas Jefferson authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition to give the US government a better idea of what had actually been purchased. 

EDIT: I should clarify that there were several French settlements, with French inhabitants (Canadiens) across the territory that is now the USA; it wasn't just military outposts and fur traders.  Most of the French settlements, however, were east of the Mississippi River in Illinois Country, or south of St. Louis.  Lots of French place-names survive from this period, like Detroit, Illinois, and all of the stuff in Pittsburgh named after Fort Duquesne.  After 1763, some of the Canadiens moved west across the Mississippi to found cities like St. Louis and Des Moines.",eli5

There's also a theory [from a biology class I just took] that on particularly painful paper cuts you could actually be slicing some of these pain receptors. 


From wikipedia: ""Paper cuts can be surprisingly painful as they can stimulate a large number of skin surface pain receptors (nociceptors) in a very small area of the skin. Because the shallow cut does not bleed very much, the pain receptors are left open to the air, ensuring continued pain. This is exacerbated by irritation caused by the fibers in the paper itself, which may be coated in chemicals such as bleach. Additionally, most paper cuts occur in the fingers, which have a greater concentration of sensory receptors than the rest of the body.""",eli5

ay6udj,Why is it children’s shampoo is “tear free” while regular shampoo burns like all hell in the eyes? ,"Soap is a chemical with a long, and kind of clever, molecule. One end of the molecule attracts water. The other end attracts dirt, particularly oily dirt. So when you wash stuff, the oily-liking end sticks in the oily dirt and the other end gets stuck in water... and so the oily dirt gets pulled away from what you are cleaning when the water-liking end gets pulled away through scrubbing or swirling water around. So put some soap on your greasy hands, and scrub a bit, and all the greasy stuff gets lifted away.

Now there are different levels of soap out there. The CLEANING 100 soap doesn't care about gentle, it just sucks dirt up like  crazy at the expense of wimpy stuff like moisture and balance. The weaker soap works, but not quite  so well, but at least it doesn't damage your skin or eyes, or dry out stuff in the process.

So stronger soap chemicals are great for super greasy dirt, but the trade-off is they cause your eyes to sting when it hits them because your eyes are sensitive to super-effective soaps.

But other soap chemicals don't cause your eyes to sting because they're not QUITE so good at sticking to oily dirt at one end, so they're not quite so good at cleaning or wrecking the careful balance of chemistry that keeps your eyes moist and in good shape.

So we have a trade-off: oily dirt removal? Or no irritation to the eyes? Which one you want goes to which ""soap"" you use in your shampoo. And baby shampoo uses the second one even if it doesn't clean as good as the first, because babies generally don't stand underneath leaky car oilpans or go swimming in cold deep fryers unless you're a really bad parent.  


\*\*EDIT: Thank you all for the mega-gilding. I shall hammer them together into a scrub brush handle so I can finally get that out-of-reach spot on my back whilst I pamper myself in long hot gentle-and-not-irritating-soapy showers. You all rock.",eli5

3wn5zd,"What is happening with the oil prices and why is it happening? Oil prices came up as subject the other day while we were discussing things while eating. I haven't really kept up with hustle about it so I couldn't keep up with the discussion either. 

I've seen some headlines on the news about Saudi Arabia trying to crush down the oil prices by pumping up more oil to the market, but what has caused all this? Did it all happen suddenly or has this all developed slowly over a long period of time

I'd really like to know the big picture behind all this.
","The US has made more oil now that the last few decades growing. 

The US experienced an oil boom a few years ago. Oil prices were around $70-90 a barrel. Only problem was they used fracking. More expensive than traditional oil drilling like Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC countries do. Fracking let's say costs $30 a barrel to operate, while classic drilling costs $10. So US companies were making $40-60 a barrel driving industry. OPEC sales fell, so controlling the market, they increased output flooding the market. Now with the increased supply, oil today is $40 a barrel. Their goal is to bankrupt more expensive US fracking. So now all these US frackers expecting to make $40-60 a barrel are now only profiting $10 a barrel. 25% their previous rate. They grew too fast with the new oil boom expecting prices to still be in the 70-90 range. The other oil nation's goal is to bankrupt these US fracking businesses so that they can raise the prices once they're all out of business. That's how despite being more scarce and in turmoil, oil is in a 8 year low.
tl-dr; OPEC increases production because they have a lower per barrel cost hoping to drive out more expensive US fracking",eli5

Kennedy  &  Johnson escalated from there. Nixon expanded the war into Cambodia  &  Thailand but that was not the reason for the impeachment.

 When his reelection campaign started he was trailing in all the polls so he directed his reelection team (Known to its own people as ""CREEP"" for Committee to Re-elect the President) to start a ""dirty tricks"" unit whos job it was to undermine and disrupt the other candidates (google Donald Segretti for a peek into some of the work they did). Eventually they hired a bunch of cuban thugs to break into the Democratic headquarters and bug their phones  &  offices, they got caught. Nixon then directed his team to pay bribes  &  hush money and to use the FBI and the CIA to thwart any investigations.  Eventually the story broke down  &  it was discovered that(he recored all conversations in his office  &  the tapes were, after a long fight given to investigators)  in addition to all of this he had plans to use every power of the Federal government to punish people he thought of as his enemies. This went beyond political enemies  &  even included the head of Otis Elevator company because Nixon once got stuck in one of their elevators!

3mr9rj,"Why does it hurt being ignored? More specifically, what goes on in the brain due to social rejection?","A lot of things go on.  How we handle social interactions is really complicated. 

I think the most basic part of it, however, is the kind of disappointment common to most of any of our reward/motivation behavior.   

* We want some response. (A specific response, acknowledgement, friendship.) 
* We imagine the outcome.  Memories of positive outcomes and memories of negative outcomes are remembered and imagined. 
* Positive outcomes motivate us.  Negative outcomes put a barrier to action. Sometimes stress will motivate us as well. 
* We focus on an expected outcome which affects us disproportionately. 
* When we have more motivation than barriers, we act.  
* After we've acted, we use the feedback to evaluate whether we exceeded the expected outcome, or fell short. 
* If the result was better than expected, we feel good, and those good feelings are associated with the memory of our action.  Next time we will be more able to overcome the barriers that keep us from trying again.
* If the result was worse than expected, then we feel bad, and those bad feelings are associated with the memory of our action.  Next time we will have more barriers to try again.

But when it's social interactions, there's a whole bunch all wrapped up in it about why it's so important that we feel accepted and how we imagine how other people will react and all that stuff.

But essentially, we want something, the more we are afraid of the negative, the more we have to build ourselves up to overcome the barriers that those negative fears have built, and the more crushing the result is when it's disappointing. 

It's also kind of the reason why it's a little easier to handle it when you expect the worst. When you expect the worst, it's not devastating when it happens, but it's still a pleasant surprise when it does.  It's just harder to get over that mental barrier when you expect the worst, because you don't have that positive expectation helping to motivate you. 

So for instance, you are terrified to talk to a girl. You had a big crush on her for months.  Finally you tried to chat with her, and she completely ignored you.  You had built up such a high expectation, and it was completely dashed.  Not to mention the fact that you feel everyone else can only barely tolerate your presence.  You feel absolutely horrible, and mortified about ever trying to talk with her again.

But then, you are assigned a project, and you're assigned a partner, not of your own choosing.  Your partner is this girl.  You can't do anything about this.  You must talk with her, everyone else in the class is collaborating with their partner, you'd look really stupid if you couldn't even talk to her on this level.  To try to not talk to her would cause more stress than talking to her for the project, so you do, and she's a normal person.  She doesn't remember that incident you agonized over, she didn't even hear you.  You do your project, and you feel a bit better, it wasn't as bad as you thought.

Alternatively, you get forced into doing the project with her, and she DOES remember, and she was intentionally trying to hurt you, and she insults you while you're working on the project.  You start to expect that behavior and it stops being surprising, and starts being annoying.  You tough it out and finish the project, or you talk to the teacher and ask to be reassigned because you can't complete it with a partner like that, and you really have lost any interest you had in this girl. And still, things are a bit better than you thought because you've been able to revise your identity narrative.  Instead of thinking ""I'm a person people ignore"" you can end up thinking ""This girl is a really nasty, it's not just me, she's just a jerk.""

But again, it's so complex.",eli5

In carbon chain fuels, the lighter the fuel, the less the amount of carbons are in one molecule of the fuel. This means that less energy can be gained from only seven bonds being broken for example when the fuel is ignited. The thicker fuels have more carbons in the chain per molecule and this produce more energy when ignited, to power a bigger engine or a bigger vehicle with less amount of fuel.

9aibxf,"Why do scientists think the Universe is flat, if we can travel in any direction? ","The flatness of the universe is often a way to describe the topography of the universe in 4 dimensions. There is no real way for us to visualize an infinitely big 3 dimensional object curving, so instead we describe it as a 2d object and reserve the 3rd dimension to describe the 4d curvature.

As for what this curvature, or lack there of, actually means is simple. The universe follows the rules of Euclidean geometry (geometry on a flat plain) almost everywhere. Pick any three points across sufficiently large space and their angles will add up to 180. This seems obvious to us, after all triangles always add up to 180, but that's only true in Euclidean space. If you where to pick 3 points sufficient distance from each other on earth surface, you would find that the angles add up to 270 degrees. This is because a sphere does not follow the rules for Euclidean geometry. There are other oddities that would happen if the universe wasn't flat like parallel lines converging or straight lines intersecting themselves.",eli5

Any optical discs has a reflective coating (usually silver) and a layer of microscopic holes that represent the binary data that is stored. Commercial prerecorded discs are pressed, similar to how paper is printed. A large steel plate holds a negative of the holes and is pressed against the plastic disc, leaving an imprint. This process is very fast and is perfect for making many many copies of the same exact disc. 

Recordable discs on the other hand have no holes/dimples on them when bought, the data is instead recorded by shining a laser at the surface, burning holes into a layer of plastic and exposing the reflective silver coating below. To make this process easier for the laser, a special dye is added to the plastic, and that dye is what makes for different colors of discs. The different colors come from various dyes that are formulated for specific wavelengths of laser light (which can enable higher write speeds), so CDs tend to be green and DVDs and BDs are usually blue or purple.",eli5

a9v3w2,Why is there a value for the square root of -1 (i) but not for dividing by zero?,"Well, *i* came about because we just decided to create a new number to fill an existing gap (""you can't take the square root of a negative number""). We made the definition that, whatever the square root of -1 is, we would call it *i*. The lovely thing is that it fits perfectly with the existing body of math, and so making this jump actually makes sense. As an example, you can rewrite √(-4) as √(4)×√(-1), by using regular algebra. √(4) is just 2, so that becomes 2×√(-1) or 2*i*. Square root of -4 is twice the square root of -1, just like square root of positive four is twice the square root of positive one. This makes sense.

So let's make that same jump for division by zero. Let's take 1/0 and, whatever that number is, call it *q*. We now have the relationship

 > 1/0 = q

which we can rewrite using regular algebra as

 > 1 = q×0

But this has a problem. An equation that looks like this can't exist alongside the math that we already have, because we *already* have a definition for zero times a number. Zero times any number, positive negative imaginary or otherwise, is by definition zero. Zero times three million is zero, zero times -47*i* is zero, zero times *q* should also be zero. We can't assign a value to x/0, because of the way we already define zero.

TL;DR: making *i* meant making some new rules, but they fit perfectly with the ones we already have. They just added extra stuff we could do. Making a value for 1/0 would require breaking rules that already exist in math.

 & #x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all the positive feedback, it warms my heart to see so many people thinking and wondering about math. My answer is of course my own simplified slice of a very rich topic. I couldn't help but notice that some of you are naturally thinking and asking towards a bigger slice: **limits**. What if we don't just look at an isolated point like ""7/0 = ?"", but instead have a whole function to work with? We can get some interesting and much more satisfying answers by looking at how the function behaves as it gets closer and closer to dividing by zero.

The simplest such function is y = 1/x, which is easy enough to answer for every nonzero x-value. What about at x = 0? Well let's look at the [graph](_URL_0_). If we start on the left side and follow the curve closer and closer to the y-axis, it shoots way down towards negative infinity. If we follow the same approach from the right side, it heads towards positive infinity. You can see why, unlike *i*, there isn't a single answer when dividing by zero. Even just this one function points to two different answers depending on how we come at it.

Okay, let's try [y = sin(x)/x](_URL_1_). Just worry about how it looks right beside the y-axis, on both sides. As you get closer and closer to x = 0, since sine of 0 equals 0, you approach the question y = 0/0 = what? This time however, the function points towards an answer of 1, no matter which direction you approach from. So in this case, we can say that the *limit* of the function as you *approach* 0/0 is 1. The specific point ""y = 0/0"" isn't calculatable and has no defined value, but the nice and simple behaviour of the function through that point lets us say the *limit* at that point is 1. Mind you, this is only when you approach it from inside that exact function. 

In *general*:

But I haven't necessarily destroyed information. I might remember the rock.

It's generally accepted that both of these are impossible. But general relativity suggests that black holes should be able to destroy information.

cf55fv,Why do old movies and videos have this sorta staticky sound in the background and modern ones don’t? ,"A lot of reasons: 
Old movies had the soundtrack imprinted on the film, it was analogue and intrinsically noisy - like cassettes, the same was true of video. Also copying the film to make a new print or change the format would introduce more noise. To deal with that Cinemas had quite sophisticated analogue noise reduction to minimize the background noise. 

Old TVs were pretty quiet so we weren't as aware of the background sound. Older equipment tended to have less treble and more bass so hiss was muted.

Modern TV speakers are smaller have a lot less bass so we notice the treble hiss more.  

Modern recordings have digital sound which pretty much has no background noise like tape hiss - and copies are identical to the original so the hiss level doesn't go up when copied for modern recordings.",eli5

The sugar isn't forming polymers is it? What is it about about sugar that can make a syrup but salt cannot?,"Firstly, they are very different chemicals. When salt dissolves in water it breaks apart (dissociates) into sodium and chlorine ions which are individually herded (conjugated) by water molecules. Sugars are much larger, complex molecules which do not generally break apart when interacting with water.

Because sugars are carbohydrates, they can participate in hydrogen bonding which increases viscosity and surface tension. Each molecule's ""heads"" try to stay close to their neighbors' ""butts"". Because they are larger and are mostly planar they can more strongly interact through van der Waals forces (this effect is small compared to the hydrogen bonding in solution)",eli5

It seems like you would need to ask way more people, but you actually really don't. A general rule of thumb is that if you want to sample a population of size X, you only really need to ask sqrt(X) people to get an accurate result. The square root of 300 million is somewhere around 17 thousand, so 20 thousand people with Nielsen boxes is more than enough.

Why's that the case? Well, the math behind it is fairly sophisticated, unfortunately. Suffice to say that this is something that has both theoretical (ie mathematical) backing, and has also been verified by people who actually went through the trouble of asking an entire large population something and comparing it to their result when they only asked a small subset of the population.

ygibe,"; What were the causes and consequences of the intergration of Little Rock High School in the 1950's? Title says it all and I will need to link it to the Plessy vs Fergusson case and the Brown vs Board of Education.
Any answers would be great help! 
","* Plessy vs. Fergusson (1896) was the Supreme Court case of Homer Plessy, who was arrested for breaking Louisiana's separate-car law after he sat in a whites-only car of the train. Think like Rosa Parks, but on a train and with a man who was only 1/8 black. The Court upheld that the separate-car law was constitutional, and that case was used to justify segregation and Jim Crow laws all over the South.


* Brown v Board of Education (1954) was a class-action suit filed by parents of elementary schoolchildren in Topeka. The 3rd-grade daughter (Linda Brown) of one of the plaintiffs had to travel over a mile to attend a black school when there was a white school just blocks away from her home. The Court decided that ""separate-but-equal"" was a load of crap and that segregation was unconstitutional. This meant that the government now had to integrate public schools.


* The state of Arkansas, being part of the Deep South and all, initially resisted Brown v Board of Education because its white population really REALLY didn't want their kids going to the same schools as black children. But eventually they couldn't put it off any longer, and so in 1957 they picked Central High School in Little Rock to be an integration testing ground, allowing only nine black students to attend. But the segregationists, including the state governor Orval Faubus, didn't like that, which is why the state national guard showed up on the first day of school to keep the black students from entering. It took another month and the protection of the U.S. Army for the black students to even get into the school, where they were allowed to attend classes but were generally abused by their white classmates. 


* A year later, Governor Faubus was still fighting for a postponement of integration. When he didn't get it, he instead closed all the public schools in the state, intending to lease the buildings to private schools. This way, with every school being controlled by private charters instead of by the government, the state could get away with continuing to segregate students. But that plan didn't work either, and so there was really no functioning school in Little Rock during what should have been the 1958-1959 academic year. Tensions between blacks and whites got worse during the ""Lost Year"", because the white community blamed the black community for the schools closing. Eventually, the Little Rock school board replaced some of its segregationist members with people who supported integration, and the public schools were reopened in August 1959 - accepting both white and black students. Though race relations were still extremely tense in Little Rock, African Americans living there could finally send their kids to school.",eli5

11vefc,"How come I never hear people from Russia and other western Asian countries referred to as Asian. Whenever someone says Asian I think of Japan, China, Korea, and other Easter Asia countries. I don't believe I have ever heard a Russian called Asian despite the country being (mostly) in Asia. Is there a reason for this?","Before the 1960s, people of East/South-East Asian descent were called ""Oriental."" However, in the 1960s, Asian American rights activists thought that term was both derogatory and colonialist (meaning, ""carried all the overtones of Western ethnocentrism/Eastern subordination, subjugation, and 'Otherness'""). These activists looked for a more neutral term to describe themselves, and eventually started using the term ""Asian American.""  Note: all these activists were almost exclusively people of East/South-East Asian descent, as the South Asian/Central Asian (Middle Eastern) population in the US was minuscule at this time.

In the 1970s, this term took a turn for the formal when academics (most notably [Yuji Ichioka](_URL_0_)) started using the term Asian American in scholarly papers/books/writings. From there, it slowly seeped into mainstream usage, where it was shortened to simply ""Asian.""

**EDIT:** Keep in mind that the term ""Asian"" referring to people from EAST Asia is purely American. In the UK, SOUTH Asian individuals (Indians, Sri Lankans, etc.) are called ""Asian,"" and East Asians are called ""East Asian,"" ""Chinese"" (go figure), or ""Oriental"" (which ISN'T considered to have negative connotations over there, REALLY go figure).

So what are South Asians called in the US? Are they Asian as well? Varies based on who you ask, including between South Asians. I can also tell you that most American governmental things/standardized testing/surveys don't include ""South Asian"" as a race, so they get grouped under Asian.",eli5

Serious answer: this is the fight or flight response in action. ""Embarrassment"" is a human emotion, but it triggers primal feelings -- either kill the thing that embarrassed you or run away from it.

In order to do that, your body needs to pump blood to your muscles, and it does that by opening the floodgates -- i.e. the vessels and capillaries in your muscles and near the surface of your skin.

End result -- if you have pale skin, you turn bright red. You are now ready to either kick the crap out of the person who embarrassed you or run away fast.",eli5

7k30bc,What is a bubble in investments and why do they occur? ,"A bubble is when assets are priced higher than their underlying value.  This is typically fueled by speculative investing or over-zealousness - basically, too much money being invested in the asset which causes prices to rise too fast.  They are tricky to predict, because you can only really tell something was bubble when the bubble pops - the asset prices drop back down to normal levels.

A good example of this was the housing bubble.  Housing prices typically rise, to they have always been seen as good investments long term and banks were happy to give out mortgages to people for them (since it was easy to just sell the house and make your money back in case of default).  The bubble happened when the banks gave out _too many_ mortgages to people who would have trouble paying them back.  This resulted in a lot more people trying to buy houses, which drove prices up. This lead to larger mortgages being issued, which drove prices up even further.  It was a bubble caused by too much money in the housing market.  

When people started defaulting, the banks couldn't sell the assets at the high prices anymore, so prices fell, which caused more defaults.   The bubble popped.

This is overly simplistic, but you get the idea.",eli5

2rj25a,"What claims do Argentina and Great Britain have to the Falkland Islands, and why has the dispute never been resolved? I've done some fleeting research into the history and geopolitics of the Falkland Islands, yet I've struggled to come across a balanced and well-sourced review of the situation. Is anyone able to provide a relatively unbiased, brief and reliable overview of this topic?","NB: There's a lot more to this, but I'll cover the main points.

Argentine claim:

* Proximity
* The principle of *[Uti possidetis juris](_URL_0_)* which basically states that newly formed sovereign states should have the same borders that the preceding occupying power had before independence. Argentina's take on this is that the Spanish were the colonial power in command of the Falklands when Argentina became independent from Spain, therefore the Falklands passes to Argentina.
* A period of de jure control of the islands between 1820-1832, and a period of de facto control between 1832-1833.

British claim:

* That the Falklands have been a de jure part of the British Empire since 1690.
* That the Falklands have been a de facto part of the British Empire/Overseas Dependencies since 1833.
* That the population is from British descent and overwhelmingly wish to stay part of the UK's overseas dependencies.

Both claims have stronger and weaker parts to them. The British claim of de jure occupation since 1690 is tenuous on many fronts, since often this was only a tiny garrison and the islands were at times completely abandoned. Spain's claim to the islands was certainly better reinforced in terms of maintaining a presence there, but they too abandoned the islands in the early 1800s. Argentina's inheritance claim to the isles is therefore equally tenuous.

It is best to dismiss all and any claims of inheritance since they're hotly disputed on many fronts. The proximity claim is also weak and there are no lack of precedents to dispute it worldwide. Furthermore, it's difficult to really decisively or objectively pick out any truly legitimate claim in the  disputes over control in the early 1800s. Great Britain never accepted Argentina's occupation since they never gave up their claim to the islands, and they expelled the tiny garrison that Argentina installed there in 1832. The British then populated the islands with their own subjects. 

The only truly salient point from all of the above is that nowadays, pushing 200 years from the date that the British expelled the Argentine garrison in 1833, the population of the islands desires to remain under British control. A war was fought over them that resulted in a decisive British victory, and a referendum of self-determination was held that resulted in the same. In some ways this is a self-fulfilling prophecy and an example of ""might is right"", but in absence of a truly compelling claim by anyone else (in reality France has the best claim but doesn't press it) this is the fairest way to resolve the dispute. As stated elsewhere, the only reason this issue pops up is to distract the Argentine population from the very real shortcomings of their current and past governance.",eli5

24vylo,Why does everyone hate Comcast so much? ,"When I was with them I had micro outages roughly once a week. That was annoying but tolerable I guess. Plus at $65 the internet only service was not terrible at least. Then I moved out of the area that Comcast services and was told that my year-to-year contract had become a 3 year contract and that I needed to pay 75% of it in order to cancel it. That means that I owed $1,600 in early termination fees. All this after they ""lost"" the recording when I told them that I didn't want a contract, etc.

I called to resolve the issue and it required working with the Better Business Bureau, complaining on Twitter constantly, and some pretty damning articles on the Washington Post in order to talk them down to $400. Even worse, they refused to let me record calls (even though they record them) and wouldn't work with me at all.

5lptcy,"Why do we need sea ice? I saw an article describing potential methods of engineering sea ice to sustain or rebuild our melting sea ice. Why do we need sea ice, and what happens if it all melts? Bonus points if you can explain why some researchers claim ice levels are growing while others are saying they are dangerously low.","Sea ice is white, so it reflects a lot of radiation back into the atmosphere and into space where it can't be absorbed as heat. 

If it all melts, greenhouse warming effects can be compounded, resulting in even more CO2 being released by soil and methane clathrates, resulting in more greenhouse warming, resulting in more greenhouse gasses being released... it's a very negative cycle.

The world is currently in a stage of the Milankovich cycle (the cycle that determines long-run average temperature, things like ice ages and such) where things *should* be cooling down... but the average global temperature, per-year, is rapidly rising in direct opposition to this. Regular seasonal variations in the amount of sea ice are common (it's winter in the northern hemisphere, so regionally more ice may form) but over time the amount of sea ice present is decreasing, and is currently at dangerously low levels and is continuing to decrease.

Now for my personal tinfoil hat part: Some 'researchers' will buy into politicized 'facts' (read: fabrications) that the amount of sea ice is increasing on one particular day, so, to them, obviously climate change can't be real. There's that biased aspect to some 'studies,' (especially corporate-funded ones, don't trust a report on climate change sponsored by Exxon-Mobil) so you should be careful what climate studies you pay attention to.",eli5

asryd6,"If hail is ice, what causes rain to become hail instead of snow? ","Hail is a summer event.

In the summer, you can have giant thunderstorm clouds which have huge temperature differences within the cloud (ice cold up high), very warm down low.  There are often large updrafts in the clouds.  

Drops of water will get blown up into the colder part of the cloud where it will freeze into ice.  The ice will fall for a bit but then get caught in another draft of upward flowing air and go back up into the colder part again where it gets another layer of ice.  The cycle continues until the ball of hail gets too heavy and falls out of the cloud... reaching the ground before it can melt in the summer air.  The size of the ball of hail tells you how strong the storm is because it tells you how many times the ball was blown back up into the highest part of the cloud before it finally fell.

Snow is a winter event.  Tiny ice crystals form in a cold cloud and fall to the earth.  No updrafts of win.  Freezing rain is another wintry event.  Rain falls from a warmer cloud but freezes in colder air before it reaches the ground.",eli5

ah2qw7,Why can we sometimes see heatwaves?,"If you're talking about a mirage, it's because of the change in density that heat causes. When solar radiation hits concrete or sand, it heats up (the darker the surface, the faster this happens). That heat is then transferred into the air closest to the hot surface. Since heat causes a decrease in density, and less dense objects float, the hot air then rises and is replaced by cooler air from higher up, which is then heated in turn, etc. When observed at the proper angle, the rising and falling layers of air distort the light, and cause the rippling visual effect that we associate with mirages.

You can also see this in water (more dramatically, in fact). If you can get a hold of a tall, thin Pyrex container, try filling it with water and lighting a tea candle underneath. You'll be able to see the waves of heat. It's pretty cool looking, and you can make it even more dramatic by adding a drop or two of food coloring.",eli5

The iris is the muscular stuff that can constrict and change the size of your pupil. Your pupil isn't a structure: it's a hole whose size is changed by the constriction or relaxation of the iris.  
The cornea is the part of your eyeball that sits in front of the iris that has the lens in it.  
Your cornea has more nerves in it than the sclera does.  
When you touch (or poke) the cornea, you notice it more because more nerves get triggered.  
This makes sense, since the cornea is way more important than the sclera.

12x11q,Why the world cant have a single currency? ,"Let's take a look a the Euro.  It is an economic and monetary union (i.e. single currency with multiple, 17 European and 10 non-European, member nations).  But it is fundamentally flawed (not to mention structurally) in the sense that it is comprised of several, vastly different economies.  Greece, Spain, and other southern Euro economies will never be able to compete with northern economies like Germany.  Think about it, Greece produces commodities and tourism services while Germany creates pharmaceuticals and automobiles.  Greece, if it remains in the Euro, will always have an overvalued currency due to Germany's obvious advantage in the goods that it produces.  This will crush any prospects of growth in the southern economies, especially Greece due to its size, because the costs of labor will remain expensive.  There is no central banking function that will allow Greece to devalue its currency relative to other countries in the Euro. When you have a single currency it does create a common market that allows materials, labor, etc to move more freely, but when you have cultural and linguistic differences, it constrains this mobility.  Now if we put this example on a global scale the same thing would happen. We would see an influx of trade and capital into the stronger bigger economies, while systematically denying small, less competitive economies any prospect of growth.",eli5

609ykf,If raising our heart rate through exercise is healthy why is raising our heart rate with stimulants like caffeine considered bad for our hearts?,"It is dangerous based on how it causes heart rate increase. With exercise, you are increasing the muscular need for oxygen and, therefore, the cellular response from muscle to blood stream is to increase heart rate and blood flow to those muscles. Your heart rate increases, blood pumps faster, your breathing increases to increase oxygen turn over,  the process continues. However, with amphetamines, you bypass all that natural signalling and cause increased heart rate and vascular constriction with no target for exchange of oxygen or co2. As such, that same reaction is dangerous without an outlet, if that makes sense. Your pumping massive amounts of blood and elevating a heart rate with no way of alleviating that pressure in the system. Your muscles aren't​ needing the extra blood flow so your circulatory system is just pounding away. That kind of stress is unhealthy for the system because there is no outlet (the muscles, liver, and brain don't need the extra blood flow so it's just zooming around increasing pressure within the system). Also it's a neurochemical reaction so the stimulant binds to receptors in the brain and 'fakes' the need for increased 'fight or flight' reaction so there is adrenaline in the reaction which isn't as present in exercise. The whole process is more physiological stress than healthy physiological need. The drugs fake a need, cause an extra reaction, and ultimately cause stress on a system. Repeated stress will cause system failure eventually. I hope this makes sense.",eli5

Specific to electricity, ancient civilizations knew about electric charges, though they did not have the necessary scientific tools to explore them. According to [Wikipedia](_URL_0_):

 > Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing.

23b2z3,"What is region locking, and why does it exist? I hear comments or threads discussing how video or gaming content is blocked in certain areas globally, but not because of laws but cooperate policy. Why would companies be motivated to ban their product from a potential market? I don't get it.","It allows them to price differentiate. For example, a game released in the US can cost $60, and the same game, but European-regioned can cost €60. If you compare those prices, €60 is about $82 nowadays. So, if there wasn't region locking, a European could order the $60 game from the us, and as long as they paid less than $22 on shipping, they could get it for cheaper. With locking, the game company can get that $22 extra off its European customers without worrying about having to compete with its own pricing from another country.

Games have sort of moved away from this system. As a European in the US, I'm glad my PS3 can play games from both sides of the ocean fine (the PS3 still supports locking, but 99% of games are not enforcing the lock). The 3DS is still locked though.

For movies, it's both the above and that licensing laws are still very restrictive, so region locking allows content producers to keep their products inside a certain region. Stuff like Netflix ""could"" be global and allow people to sign up for it from everywhere, but for some reason I don't really know movie companies would prefer to lose that revenue and keep it locked.",eli5

Doesn't that just give a hacker a single place to get all of my passwords at once if they get through? ,"Password managers are useful because they can allow you to use much more secure passwords as opposed to passwords that are easier to remember and, probably, easier to guess.  It means that when as password database gets stolen, it will take significantly longer for brute-force methods to get your password.

It's safer because when people are looking to break into accounts they generally don't care which accounts they get.  They just run the whole list looking for people who did use easy passwords and then seeing what they can steal from the related accounts.  They're not targeting you directly.  Someone who is targeting you directly and get can get access to your computer (either physically or via the internet) with enough access to do something like steal your password manager file will probably be able to circumvent any passwords you chose anyway.  

Even if they do get the file, most password managers use *very* robust encryption.  For example, 256-bit Twofish (like is used in Password Safe) is essentially impossible to break on any meaningful timeline even with massive computing resources.",eli5

1pnayz,Why does masturbating help clear out my sinuses out? ,"Erections work by hydraulics. Blood vessels down there expand, making tissue swell. If the blood vessels contract, then it shuts off.

Congestion is also under the control of blood vessels. If the blood vessels around your sinuses expand (or become inflamed due to infection or allergies) then the mucus membranes in there leak more fluid into your nose where it mixes with other stuff (the protein mucin controls consistency) to become mucus. If the blood vessels contract, then mucus production stops.

Ejaculation sends a powerful pulse through your sympathetic nervous system and leaves it abuzz with activity. Blood vessels throughout your body constrict, causing your erection to deflate and stay that way for a while so people take a break. This is called a refractory period, and during this time your nose won't be able to make much mucus either leading to clear sinuses.",eli5

","Guitar is simply using all the available strings as opposed to only 3 of them. They double the A because the the root or tonic or the chord. Meaning it's the most important note. It's why we call it an A chord. They double the E because it's the dominant note and a perfect fifth above the tonic. It's a really important note also. Those two notes alone are enough for us to understand we are listening to an A chord. The C# is the third. This note is important but also not. It simply tells us if we are playing in happy major or dark mysterious minor (if it were a C natural). 

On piano, we just play A C# E as a stacked chord. We could add more A and E pitches in different octaves to give the chord a bigger sound, but we just don't.  

Tldr: guitar repeats A and E to utilize more strings and fill out the chord. Piano is lazy and just plays the basic 3 finger chord.",eli5

In many of the offensives in World War I, it resulted in usually hundreds of thousands of casualties for both sides. In D-Day however, the Americans and British lost only about 20,000 men, which is relatively small compared to the amount of people that would die on a World War I offensive. With the invention of better military technology and tactics shouldn't there be way more losses in World War II?","If you're talking about total military deaths, WWI had around 10 million, WWII had around 22 to 25 million. Germany alone had around 5 million dead soldiers. World War II was by far a more deadly time. 

If you're looking at individual battles, D-Day, while one of the most important battles in the war, had very few casualties, and America in general had far fewer casualties than countries like Germany, Japan, Russia, and China. It seems like WWII had fewer casualties, but that's us with our American education that focuses on our own involvements. I guarantee in Russia, with the Soviets losing 10+ million soldiers alone in WWII, they teach it differently.

It's true that WWI was mostly trench warfare, and each battlefield would have hundreds of thousands of casualties over the course of years. But WWII had more isolated fights, city-to-city, house-to-house, a small company lost in the woods, an aircraft carrier sinking with thousands of sailors. While the technology allowed wars to be fought in the open, it only splintered armies, and while each battle had fewer deaths than WWI's trenches, there were a lot more desperate battles going on... southeast Asian jungles, South African deserts, bombed out cities.

Edit: I also want to point out that Allied (mostly American) firebombings in Japan killed between 240,000 to 900,000 people. We moved away from the trenches, and instead of soldiers dying to shield their people, our new technology can bypass them and go straight for the civilians.",eli5

If you own a couple hundred million in stock, a couple of million in CEO salary doesn't make much of a difference.

Plus, salaries are paid whether the company is doing well or not. Stocks only become more valuable if the company is making money. If a CEO takes a low salary, it is a signal to other investors that they think the company will gain in value in the future. 

Finally, the CEO gets taxed at 40% on salary, but only 20% on capital gains (stock price increase.) 40-20=20% difference. That adds up to a ton of cash when you're talking about millions and millions of dollars of total compensation.",eli5
3j57zt,"Why are there different grammar/spelling rules for ""It's"" and ""what's""? ","""*It's*"" actually means ""*it is*"" even though lots of people use ""*it's*"" to indicate possession.

For example, the sentence ""*the dog grabbed it's ball*"" is grammatically incorrect because what you are actually saying is ""*the dog grabbed it is ball*"" which obviously does not make grammatical sense. 

Instead the sentence should be ""*the dog grabbed its ball*"" - which is the correct way to indicate possessiveness in this case.

In the case of ""*what's*"", it can only mean one thing (""*what is*""). It can't be confused with a possessive *s* because *what* is not a pronoun. 

Therefore, if you type something like ""*whats*"" instead of ""*what's*"", that's considered more like a spelling error / typo than a grammatical mistake. It's not that you're completely changing the grammatical meaning of the sentence, you're just not typing the word(s) in correctly. Some programs may also expect you to write ""*what is*"" as two words instead of ""*what's*"" because the latter may be considered too casual/informal.",eli5

It has been 4500 years since the construction of the Pyramids, Egypt has been through a lot in that time.  Egypt went through 27 more dynasties after the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza until they were conquered by Alexander the Great, then a small scuffle, then conquered and held by Rome.

One reason it is bittersweet is because it clearly articulates the passage of time and inevitability of death.  Another reason is that when one recalls a wonderful time past it is also very clear that it can never happen again, and that brings a certain amount of remorse.

Here are two examples.  I often recall my boyhood and the memories are usually good.  Then I am reminded that decades have passed and seemed to have passed quickly.  That causes a bittersweet memory.

I remember things my daughter did when she was two.  She will never be two again and that makes me a little sad.",eli5

I'm sure Einstein's theory of relatively must have helped in a big way, but what other scientific breakthroughs have helped shape today's technological world and have allowed it to develop so rapidly?","Relativity likely doesn't play as much of a part as you think.  How would that be used to create iPods? Or more efficient HVAC systems?

Technology builds upon itself.  The more technology available, the more technology that can be created.

Without the transistor, there would be no feasible personal electronics or computers.  Since that transistor was created, new things can be created which depend upon that transistor. The transistors and other things can be combined, or the transistor can be used to create a new thing.

Item 1 lets you develop something that lets you then create Item 2, Item 3 and Item 4.  Without Item 1, none of these would have even been possible.  But now that you have Item 2, you can use that to create, develop, invent, or produce Item 5 6 7 8 and 9.

This government fought an communist insurgency between 1927 to 1936, but after the Japanese invaded, there was an uneasy truce/alliance to present a common front against the Japanese.

After the surrender of the Japanese, there was a huge power vacuum in China and the Communist insurgency was now a lot bigger, attracting a lot of people in their rank to fight the Japanese. So after WW2, the insurgency developed into a civil war. The Communist constantly attacked the capital, forcing the the ''official'' Chinese government to keep retreated back until they had to flee on the island of Taiwan by the end of 1949. About 2 million people were transferred on Taiwan, while the local population at the time was 6 million. This government still had loyal forces on the mainland controlling region like Tibet and several others, but all of those eventually fall under the communist control by 1951.

So Taiwan consider themselves the legitimate government of China, in exile. While Communist China consider Taiwan the last remaining land they need to take control of to finish the civil war, but that the US protect.

For Tibet, the region was under Chinese control for a long long time, but the region have a different culture and language. Tibet have a independence movement and the authoritarian government of China won't allow them. It's not just because they are bad guys either, the deep root reason is that Tibet are the source of most of rivers in China and provide a geographical protection against any outside forces. Losing Tibet, would put China at risk of outside influence. For example, an independent Tibet could ally themselves with an enemy of China, which would allow them to put forces right next to the rich region of central China, or construct Dam, limiting the water going in the Rivers that go through China, which could put the agriculture of China in danger. 1 Billion of people is a lot of people to feed and a great risk of revolt if food supply decrease.",eli5

Doing this on regular basis will with time, small by small break your vessels on fingertips and you will freeze on fingertips more easily, you will feel more less, they will be whiter (also less blood flow).

Once your hand faces this frequently, you will feel it less and less, that is where you should be aware of vibration damages.


It's recommended to use gloves so it absorbs the vibration rather than naked skin/hand.


That tingly feeling is when blood flow starts back and your nerves can feel the blood flow starting back.

p3vqa,"Why do computer processing speeds continue to increase? I know Moore's Law, and it's clear that it's essentially true, but I have a couple questions: 

1. Why do computers seem no faster now than they used to? 
2. If Photoshop and FCP and whichever other processor-heavy applications aren't really changing that much, why do computers need to keep getting faster? 

","Things have gotten a lot faster, really - in even the last 10 years, processor speeds have gone up by a pretty good margin.  Now you can buy stuff that clocks in at like 3.3GHz, which would have been totally crazy back in the year 2000.

But I suppose you're talking about things ""seeming"" faster.  Well, that's probably because computers are super, super fast.  Like, right now I programming something that is for a board that clocks in at 50MHz, something that most people would balk at - fifty megahertz, that's terrible!  The computer's clock only ticks 50 000 000 times a second!  If there's something I want to do that takes, say, 5000 steps, the computer takes a hundred microseconds to do it.  (100 * 10^-5, or 0.001 seconds.)

Now, I could pick up a nice processor today that runs at... say, sixty times that speed (3GHz).  I do the exact same operation with the exact same steps  (aside: computer people, let's just assume the exact same instruction set, ok?).  Now I get a result in 166 *nano* seconds (that's 0.000000166 seconds).

That's a lot of zeroes, so the two are off by a *huge* factor.  But how about this:  you tell me the difference between the two.  I'll start my stopwatch, and you tell me STOP! once some time between  0.000000166 and 0.001 seconds have passed.  I'm not sure you'd get it on your first try.

Humans just have this limit of perception when it comes to things that are very small.  You can't easily tell the difference between 10 nanoseconds and 100 nanoseconds any more easily than you can tell the difference between 10 nanometres and 100 nanometres, even though if it were the same factors' difference on a larger scale - like 10 centimetres and 100 centimetres - it'd be very, very obvious to you.  It's just that computers live in this world where *literally billions of things are happening every second* - and it's hard to tell when that changes.

~

As for the second part of your question, well - why not?  If we have better hardware, we can attempt bigger and better things with software.  There's kind of a symbiotic relationship between the two - better hardware means that people can attempt more complex things with software; when people push machines to their limits, other people want to make better machines.

It's also worth mentioning that even on a supercomputer that has hundreds of processors all working together, some things can take *hours* to finish computing (mostly in scientific fields).  I've done some work with a supercomputer, and when I wanted to submit a job for it to run I'd have to get in a virtual line and wait for my turn - even running constantly and doing trillions of things per second, there was more demand for the supercomputer's time than there was actual processing time available.",eli5

We are the first species on Earth that can completely destroy ourselves if we're too shortsighted with our use of technology and exploitation of the environment. Before recent times, there was *no need* for any animal to be able to think long-term.
Our brains are good at immediate, simple benefits like, ""I am hungry, so I hunt,"" or ""I am under attack, so I will run,"" or even, ""I *will* be hungry, so I'll plant these seeds.""

When it comes to things like pollution and global warming, where the effects are very gradual and may not effect us much for decades, the brain is basically like, ""Yeah, that sounds like a *future*-me problem,"" and goes on its way, whistling merrily. Hence why we destroy the environment for short-term rewards, ignoring the long-term disaster it could bring.

In every way it's symtoms mimic a Myocardial Infarction or Acute coronary syndrome. It can even show ST elevation on an ECG indicating a STeMI (which means that heart tissue is being damaged). For emergency medical personnel we treat it as a 'heart attack.' 

The largest hypothesis is the myocardium typically metabolizes fat and during these events the myocardium instead tries to use glucose (sugar). Since this is an emotionally stressful event heart rate increase meaning the heart works harder using more glucose (burns fast like gas) instead of fat (burns slower like charcoal). 

The issue is we see that the heart is not getting the necessary components for metabolism which is 

glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy

In a typical MI a thrombus prevents oxygen reaching the myocardium creating strain and an acidic environment due to the lack of oxygen. 

This is similar since the heart does not have enough sugar to continue doing work. It is similar to a hypoglycemic patient but the low blood sugar is localized to one spot rather than systematically. The heart usually resolves this issue with out medical intervention, but there have been cases that I'm which they were suspicious of death due to Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy.

1a107i,"What is Diplomatic immunity, and why does it exist? ","ELI5: Take two friends, Billy and Jack. They both live with their parents, who are friends as well. Billy's house is all carpeted, so it is a rule to take off your shoes before entering the house. Jack's house is all hardwood floors, so in Jack's house there is no ""take your shoes off"" rule.


Now, Billy invites Jack to play at his house. Jack goes in the house and doesn't take off his shoes, what should Billy's parents do? If Billy forgot to take off his shoes he would get a scolding (he knows the rules). But Jack is a temporary visitor who doesn't know the rules, and Billy's parents want to keep their good relationship with Jack's parents. So they explain to Jack that they take their shoes off at Billy's house, and leave the scolding to Jack's parents (who can or not scold him when he gets back home).


tl:dr - A diplomat is not expected to know all the laws of the country he/she is going to. Since they are representing a foreign government in a different country, measures are taken so that their job can be done as smoothly as possible, and to minimize possible embarrassments.


**Edit1**: okay, I wrote the micro scale of ""what"" and ""why"". From the perspective of the *individual* I still stand by my post, from a macro, nation-state, scale it is indeed lacking in content. Others have pointed out where it lacks ([Bartleby9's](_URL_0_) is a good one), so I will try to add to the discussion (sorry, this won't be at ELI5 level).


Diplomatic immunity has a huge history, but the way we it's codified today was brought on by the Vienna Convention in 1961. The Convention is a huge document, and it established the basic rules regarding diplomacy among Nation States. [Its basic provisions entail]( _URL_1_): The right of the host country to declare a member of the diplomatic corps as *persona non grata*; confirms the inviolability of mission premises (cops/military can’t just storm the place. E.g. Assange’s case); guarantees free communication between a mission and its sending State (can’t violate diplomatic bag, nor stop a diplomatic courier); diplomats cannot be arrested or detained (except when the sending country waives this right. E.g. [this case in 2002](_URL_2_)). The Convention also established a series of limitations on diplomatic immunity as to minimize the chance of assholes abusing this right (which still happens, but that’s another story).


The overall political/IR justification for diplomatic immunity is tied to the idea of sovereignty. A diplomatic mission is seeing as an extension of the sending country, they are a bunch of *people* but are representing a whole *sovereign country*. Their rights cannot be violated because for all intents and purposes they are part of a different country, therefore such violation could be seen as an act of war. This arrangement is a measure of trust, and a demonstration that the host country recognizes the sending country sovereignty, and vice-versa. That is not to say the rules cannot be exploited/broken.


As with the rest of the international system, the whole thing is a castle of cards held together by cautious trust. Without an overseen body (hierarchically above the nation states) to punish those who violate the rules, the whole thing is based on mutual trust, and unspoken rules. However, countries do a (overall) decent job of maintaining the system. Diplomats who abuse their immunity are usually declared *persona non grata* by the host country, have their immunity waived by the sending country, or are punished in some way by the sending country.

In contrast, consider Saudi Arabia. It has vast petroleum reserves and a relatively small population. Saudi citizens don't actually produce any meaningful amount of wealth - they're just the beneficiaries of random happenstance that no one has bothered to take away from them. As a result, the government of Saudi Arabia has no reason to permit their citizens any sorts of rights.

In essence, you listen to the people who produce the money. When those people are the skilled artisans, intellectuals and laborers of your nation, you end up with a developed nation. When they're the plutocrats who control very narrow resource wealth corridors, you end up with an undeveloped nation controlled by those plutocrats and run for the benefit of those plutocrats.",eli5

There are many theories to explain this peculiar size.
One of these goes back to a very practical issue dated back to the 18° century, when they discovered the importance to store the wine in glass bottles.
At the time, the glass bottles were made by glass blowers. Their pulmonary strenght was obviously limited and permitted to create only bottles up to 650-750 ml size. So they decided to use the biggest one between those, the 750 ml bottle.
According to another theory 750 ml is the exact quantity of wine per 6 serving glasses (125ml each) used in “osteria”.
Others say that the 750 ml standard was a metric adaptation of the fifth (fifth of a gallon) which was standard in the US  &  Britain. In fact each box of wine could only contain 2 gallons and the Britishes decided to put 12 bottles per box. The result is 750 ml per bottle!

1rmnm1,"Why does a semi auto bullet travel faster than a fully auto I'm Australian and we don't really have/know about automstic weapons.

Wikipedia says on the page for ak-47's that the effective travel distance is further when the gun is im semi auto mode than when it is in auto

my reaction was that the muzzle velocity depends only on the gunpowder levels in each shell

Is this a question of thermal dynamics far beyond my high school science? my only possible explanation is that the heat of the previous ignition causes the barrel to be slightly wider, meaning the bullet doesn't take a path thar is quite as direct. 

apologies if this question seems stupid to Americans.  


","Hi, Australian here.

It was probably talking about effective range.  That's the range at which you can effectively hit a target or an area.  If you're firing one shot at a time it's easier to aim.  If you're blasting away at full auto the muzzle is climbing towards the sky and the distance at which you can effectively hit a target is less because you're now less accurate.  

This is why when you watch docos on soldiers you'll notice that they fire single shots.  Blasting away just wastes ammo.",eli5

Bread is made from flour, which is made from wheat seeds that have been ground up into a powder. Inside a wheat seed, there's a core called the ""endosperm."" This endosperm is white, and the outer layer is brown. In whole wheat flour, the entire seed is ground into flour, which will contain all of the nutrients and proteins, etc., that the brown outer layer contains. (I forget the name of this layer, forgive me) White flour is made only from the endosperm, resulting from which the final product will have a more uniform texture, which is perceived as more pleasant. It will also be slightly sweeter, and bake more evenly. But as a result of this, it will not contain the nutrients or proteins present in whole wheat, (+outer layer) which is why whole wheat bread is seen as healthier.

Is there any reason to this? Is it a fighting style? Preference?

Thank you for your time","Lots of misinformed answers here. There are 2 primary knife grips. 

Sabre Grip - blade up (pointed towards enemy), relaxed firm grip, but easy maneuverability/precision due to the blade leaning forward on index finger and pushed by thumb

Reverse Sabre Grip - blade will be pointed downward, however, exact angle depends on your edged weapons training. Essentially the same relaxed but firm grip as normal Sabre style.

There are 2 modified grip style to the Sabre, called: Hammer Grip and Reverse Hammer (aka the serial killer). You basically hold the knife tightly, not angled but straight up... Or down.

Each of these grips has offensive/defensive advantages and disadvantages. Sabre grip is great for quick slashes and precision that utilize ""negative space"" during a swing (if you're skilled). But overall it has the best reach, which is a great offensive tool in a knife fight.

Now, the Reverse Sabre grip, has much less reach, but can be equally as quick as the Sabre grip (with much more training). The massive advantage to this style is that you can set up counters and parry much more effectively. This makes the reverse Sabre grip an excellent defensive tactic....

","Let's start with how we think our solar system formed. There was a big gas cloud, mostly hydrogen, that by gravity began to compress. Eventually there was a dense enough region that fusion was able to occur, which signals the start of the sun. While all that gas was compressing though, it began to orbit around the large central body (the sun), forming a disk of gas and rocky debris. Within this disk (which was in the plane of orbits that the planets currently make up) each of the planets coalesced from the remaining material that didn't form the sun (which has 99% of the mass). Since they were formed in this disk they remained there once they were formed.

On the very outskirts of the solar system the Sun's influence is very weak. Many of the Dwarf Planets are near the plane of the rest of the solar system, but since they are so far from the sun they are more subject to gravitational disturbances by nearby stars or other bodies that pass nearby.

Who provides the major ISPs (Verizon, Comcast, Quest... etc) with their internet access and why can't I just plug in somewhere myself?  Why do I have to purchase it from them?","The Internet is just a bunch of computers hooked up by a bunch of wires. Those big ISPs are the ones selling you access to that Internet because they own the wires that go up to your house. They paid a lot of money to put all those wires there.

When you let people use your wifi at your house, you're doing the EXACT same thing. You're just spending less money and reaching less people.

If you want to go do it like the big boys do it, go ahead. It'll cost a lot of money, take a lot of time, and you'll have to hire a lot of people to do a lot of work laying those wires and making sure all those modems and stuff stay working.

Or you can be a little guy ISP. Sign up with Comcast, Qwest, and whoever else provides service to your house and get their permission to sell access to that connection to other people (they'll charge you extra money to do that). Then, string wires to your neighbors' houses and sell them access. Or sell them the password to your wifi.

Eventually, if you sell enough access, other IsPs will treat you like a big boy and start calling you a backbone provider and wanting to ""peer"" with you. You'd have to sell a looooooot of access to get that big.

Just to be silly, you know what else you can do? Disconnect from the Internet, connect as many computers and neighbors and friends as you can to your little router, put a bunch of cool stuff on your network and call it ""the new Internet""! If you could get millions of people connected in your house, you just might have a better Internet than the real one!

**EDIT:** Looks like I sound daunting. Let me put it this way: If you already have a way to connect other people to your own Internet connection, you're *already* a small ISP! Starting is always the hardest part and you've already started!! It takes a little doin' but from here, you can expand to actually make money this way. And if you're really 5 and selling people your wifi password or setting up different wireless routers for all your neighborhood customers- or even using bigger antennae to reach customers further away- I doubt if your ISP would ask you to pay them more to let you keep doin' it. They might even want to hire you!! But don't take their job offers because you're 5 and that's illegal.",eli5

8e6owe,Why do B’s and E’s in music not have sharps? ,"This is a part writing thing. 

To write triads, you need chords that are all thirds apart. 

If you write a triad in C, you can use C, E, and G to make a major triad. C and E are a major third apart, and E and G are a minor third apart. 

But not all keys work like this. If I’m writing a song in F# Major (or much more likely, improvising over that chord), my V chord starts on C#. However, if you make a major chord, you’ll notice that a major third up from C# is F. 

Here’s where this starts making sense. Triads have to be two letters apart. C D E F is 4 letters apart, which means that in order for this chord to work, F must be labelled E#, or else the V chord in F# won’t make sense (C# E# G# vs. C# F G#).


You’ll also notice that Fb and Cb are just E and B, respectively. These are enharmonic equivalents that are substituted into keys that need them for chords to make sense as written. 

These keys are F# and C# (E# and B#) and Gb and Cb (Cb and Fb). The reason why you don’t see them is exactly like you would think; they’re hard to sight read! Most music is not written in these keys because accidentals are harder, especially these four. Usually if you need these keys, it’s because you play a transposing instrument, or are improvising over that chord. B.B. flat instruments, for example, would be playing F# every time they play tunes in E Major. 





Another way to think about it is this:

The key of C# is exactly like the key of C, but with all 7 notes sharped. We call C a ‘B sharp’ only because major scales can’t have 2 of the same letter in it. EG: C# D# F F# G# A# C C#

Even though if you play all these notes it will sound correct, you’ll notice that we have doubled letters, which destroys how these chords are put together on the theory side of the house. So we use B# and E#.

9qn3zv,Why are insanely huge debts owned by countries never considered a big deal?,"> Why is this not a huge issue for every country?

As long as the country is seen as being capable of paying back the debt on time, it's not really a huge issue.  It can become an issue however, when a country's economy does really badly and the financial world no longer believes that the country can pay its obligations.  Note that the USA (and a lot of other countries) have never missed a payment on the debt.

 >  Who do they own the debt to?

Anyone who has bought treasury bills or government bonds.  If you have a 401K, you are one of the people the government owes debt to.

 >  Why do the debts just keep increasing?

Government spends more than it takes in.  The current US budget spends almost half a trillion more than it gets in taxes.  See _URL_0_ for instance.

 >  What happens if it needs to be paid one day?

That's not how it works.  If you hold 100K worth of Treasury Bills that expire in say, 2020, you get money in 2020, not before.

Kind of.  National debts partially expire all the time, and at that point, part of it is paid.",eli5

Edit: Kinda sorta explained.","There are a *lot* of factors that contribute to this sentiment.

Imagine the time around the First and Second World Wars...young men were being sent overseas to fight and a *lot* of them would never return. These men were often viewed as heroes due to the fact that they were potentially giving their lives to fight for freedom, for the love of their country and whatever else was perceived to be at stake. Propaganda was used to make the war effort seem a necessity and a desirable thing to be involved in - pull together for the good of the country. Hard times now, good times later. 

There is also a certain romanticism to the idea that one might have a young girlfriend at home who will be waiting for your return. Or due to the fact that you may well be willing to die so that the rest of the folks back home can have a better tomorrow.

And so on and so on. Essentially: Propaganda, patriotism, sense of honour.",eli5

Other people have explained the theory behind taking antioxidant supplements quite well, but in studies they've been shown to not do much, or even be actively harmful.

""Two large trials of antioxidants were set up after Peto's paper .... One was in Finland, where 30,000 participants at high risk of lung cancer were recruited, and randomised to receive either beta-carotene, vitamin E, or both, or neither. Not only was there an increase in death from lung cancer among the people taking the supposedly protective beta-carotene supplements, compared with placebo,but the vitamin group also showed increased death from prostate and gastric cancers.

The results of the other trial were almost worse. It was called the ""Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial"", or ""CARET"" .... Two groups of people at high risk of lung cancer were studied: smokers, and people who had been exposed to asbestos at work. Half were given beta-carotene and vitamin A, while the other half got placebo. Eighteen thousand participants were due to be recruited throughout its course, and the intention was that they would be followed up for an average of six years; but in fact the trial was terminated early, because it was considered unethical to continue it. Why? The people having the antioxidant tablets were 46 per cent more likely to die from lung cancer, and 17 per cent more likely to die of any cause, than the people taking placebo pills.""",eli5

I understand some stores are only available in certain part of the country but wouldn't it make more sense for them to have one brand? esp if they all, essentially, offer same products. to have greater impact in terms of brand recognition? ","For most products, the idea is that having multiple brands under your umbrella allows you to produce slightly different products with different advertising aimed at different customers.

You can produce a makeup line for 18-25 women that emphasizes fun  &  freedom while your products for the 40+ crowd emphasize elegance  &  class.

Grocery stores are a little different however.  People are *really* weird about food  &  will often stick with names  &  brands they grew up with.

55te78,Why is the United States backing rebel groups in Syria? I keep seeing articles talking about how the Syrian government and Russia are trying to take Aleppo but the US doesn't want the city to be taken through ceasefires and how they are hesitant to arm the rebels because of conflicts with Russia. I'm just wondering why the US is backing and arming the rebels in the first place. I don't watch the news very much so if anybody can explain this that would be greatly appreciated! ,"There are multiple potential reasons for why the US is aiding the Syrian rebels. Which one is the 'actual' reason is going to be up for lots of debate, and will likely be coloured by your own political views. We likely won't know the actual reason until much later when the records become declassified, and historians can go through all the information with the benefit of hindsight. 

However, one potential reason is humanitarian. Bashar al-Aassad is a dictator, that's true without a doubt. Even prior to the outbreak of the war, he was repressive of his own people. The US has--as a policy--supported the replacement of dictators with democratic governments, and opposed to governments which violate international human rights norms. As such, one school of thought is that the US is backing the Syrian rebels so that Assad's government will be overthrown and replaced with a pro-American democratic government. 

Another potential reason is more *realpolitik*. Under this school of thought, the concern is much less that Assad is a dictator, and much more focused on his close ties with Russia and Iran, both states that the US is generally opposed to. Russia has a naval base in Syria, and Assad has been close with Iran for a long time. As such, the US is backing the Syrian rebels, hoping to topple the Syrian government to limit the impact of Iranian and Russian influence in the western Middle East.

Finally, there's ISIS. No one like them, and lots of people fighting them. The US may also be arming rebels in the hopes that they will help the fight against ISIS, by giving ISIS's opponents better weapons and training.",eli5

59dt0k,What is Cold Fusion and why is there so much backlash to it? ,"Currently a Ph.D. student in nuclear physics.

Cold fusion is a cool idea; it would be an amazing source of power.

The problem is that if you know even a little bit of nuclear physics, it's quite clearly impossible. There is no theory which would describe fusion at such low energies, and there are no reproducible/reputable experiments which have demonstrated that the effect exists.

I think this quote on the cold fusion Wikipedia article sums it up nicely:

 > In 1994, David Goodstein, a professor of physics at Caltech, advocated for increased attention from mainstream researchers and described cold fusion as:

 >  > A pariah field, cast out by the scientific establishment. Between cold fusion and respectable science there is virtually no communication at all. Cold fusion papers are almost never published in refereed scientific journals, with the result that those works don't receive the normal critical scrutiny that science requires. On the other hand, because the Cold-Fusioners see themselves as a community under siege, there is little internal criticism. Experiments and theories tend to be accepted at face value, for fear of providing even more fuel for external critics, if anyone outside the group was bothering to listen. In these circumstances, crackpots flourish, making matters worse for those who believe that there is serious science going on here.[34]

Basically cold fusion is now associated with scams and bad scientific practices, so the only people still paying attention to it are fringe scientists and crackpots.",eli5

The sound gets more ""thin"" although i don't change anything on 82 hertz. How's this possible? ","Think about a sine wave of 82 Hz frequency.  This repeats 82 times per second.

However, it *also* repeats 164 times per second.  And 246 times per second.  And at every integer multiple of 82 Hz.  One way of thinking about this is that if you walk around a circle once, you're back at the beginning - which is also true if you walk around a circle *twice* (or three times, or four times, etc.).  These integer multiples of the fundamental frequency are called 'harmonics'.

The way an (analog) equalizer works is that it takes an audio signal and splits into a number of different pathways.  In each pathway, it filters the signal.  The filter passes the desired signals largely unchanged while attenuating the signal outside of the frequency band significantly.  Then, down each of these pathways, you further attenuate the signal according to the dial/slider before recombining all the pathways.

What this accomplishes is that it allows you to selectively emphasize certain frequency ranges.

However, remember all those harmonics?  Well, they're getting attenuated as well.  For high frequencies, this doesn't matter much because you can't hear the harmonics anyway.

But for low frequencies, you can hear the harmonics (even though you may not realize it) and by altering their volume in relation to the fundamental frequency of the note you end up with something that sounds weird because you're so accustomed to hearing those sounds with all their harmonics intact.",eli5

When an area (be it a whole country or just smaller areas) is bilingual, with most people speaking both languages, people tend to blend them and speak both at the same time. You might speak in Language 1 but use plenty of vocabulary of Language 2, or even speak Language 1 and suddenly say a sentence or two in Language 2.

For those people, both languages come naturally, it's not a struggle to use words in the L2. In fact, they probably hear some terms or even phrases in one of two languages more often than in the other, so mixing both is actually easier and speaking a ""pure"" version of whichever language would mean thinking more. Obviously, you don't try to be a purist while speaking with friends.

For example, you may say: ""Iba yendo al *car wash* de *Fremont Street* cuando me encontré con la *manager* de Emilia alrededor de la *hardware store*.""

When I was a kid I used to speak a L1 at home but studied in a L2 at school, so a normal conversation with my mom or my friends would go something like this: ""Hoy la *andereño* nos ha devuelto las *azterketas* de *Ingurune* de la semana pasada y he sacado un *Bikain*, aunque tenía una *ariketa* mal.""

Many people  around the world speak that way. Since they all understand both languages they use, it's not a problem, and you probably hear some words more in a language (for example, vocabulary about the family in your home language) and others in another language (for example, things you hear on tv or at school in the official/""high variety""), so you are used to using different words in different languages, because it's easier that way.

1ffp1v,"Why is genetic diversity important? Iv been reading about colonizing other planets and the need for a large gene pool is always brought up, why is this important? Is it to do with interbreeding problems and what causes those problems? (sorry if this isn't the appropriate subreddit I'm not sure if I'd understand a very scientific response)","Resistance to disease is a major reason for this. In a population of people with similar genetics you run a high risk of rare, recessive diseases cropping up in the population. This is the problem with inbreeding. With recessive disease, you have to have two parents donate the same kind of defective gene in order for it to manifest at all. Otherwise one parent will give a disease gene, while the other parent will give a normal gene and you have a normal, healthy baby. With a large mix of genetics a recessive disease is likely to go unexpressed because of the majority of other individuals having a dominant, healthy gene to 'cover up' the disease. Basically all people are carriers for at least a couple of genetic diseases, and so long as there's an abundant mix of genetics to go around we're unlikely to pair up with another individual who happens to carry the same rare disease.

On the other hand, in terms of non-genetic diseases a person's genetics help determine a person's immune system and the types of bacteria/microorganisms we're resistant to. If everyone is related due to a small population size, the population is likely to be susceptible to the same diseases. This means that if one of those diseases reaches the population it's likely to be decimated. If, however, there is good genetic diversity then you can expect only a few individuals to die from exposure to the disease.",eli5

So i dont know much about price fixing, like at all, and this question may be completely invalid, but whatever. To my knowledge, there is a vast supply of diamonds in the world, but the companies that sell these diamonds only release a set number each year, thereby keeping what is a relatively abundant commodity at such a high price. Is this not some form of price fixing? Am i missing something?","It is price fixing, in the form of a cartel. A cartel is a group of businesses that instead of competing agree to cooperate to keep prices high. OPEC is a cartel of oil rich nations who cooperate instead of compete to protect their profits. Diamond distributers do the same thing. 

Why is this legal? Welcome to international law, whom are you going to sue? It's not the retailers who price fix (your local jewelry store) it's the distributers who wholesale diamonds in bulk. Who are they? Most it's just one company, DeBeers and a few others, and they're in Belgium. You can't sue another company in Belgium. And in Belgium they are not breaking any laws. So you can't do anything about them. 


So you can't sue them. You could get your nation to pass laws against them, but why would they do that? The diamond lobby is rich, they donate a lot of money to politics to protect their industry. They buy vast swaths of land, usually to prevent diamond mining. No one in charge is gonna change this because its unfair or not competitive. You can simply not buy a diamond. I guarantee that's really what's keeping the price high, the fact that people are willing to pay so much. If people ever just stop buying them, prices will drop real fast.",eli5

I have been listening to the radio and reading about greece and the eurozone, while I wont pretend to understand everything about what Germany is asking, it would seem to me that they are obviously in a better position economically so there must obviously be something to the methods they used. What is it about their ""austerity measures"" that Greece is so set against?","There's already good points here about how austerity is painful for the Greeks. Your question is asking why Greece is so upset, specifically with the Germans. I'd like to add that the Germans benefit by keeping the Greeks in the Euro, and from German point of view (solely speaking economically, that is), the more austerity for the Greeks the better.

The Germans have a gang buster manufacturing economy and export all over the world. Their unemployment is about 5%, Greeks and Spain are in the mid 20% range.

According to conventional macroeconomic theory, the more you export, the more your currency goes up. Why? Imagine if the Deutsche Mark was still their currency. If you were American and wanted to buy a German product, you'd have to go out and sell Dollars to buy Marks. Supply and demand. Demand goes up, the price of Marks goes up. As the price goes up, demand starts to ease. People end up buying fewer products until you hit some new price level for the Mark.

But they don't have the Mark for their currency anymore, do they? They have the Euro, and the Euro's demand is determinded by lots of countries. Bad economies like Greece and Spain act like an anchor on the value of the euro. 

From the Greek's point of view, the Germans are exporting like crazy, getting rich by enjoying the depressed Euro, and forcing the Greeks to suffer dire austerity that will virtually guarantee decades of stagnant growth for Greece. The Germans have a dangerous financial incentive for a prolonged bad Greek economy, and there's a strong argument that austerity will provide just that.",eli5

2dzqoq,"The solomon curve and why driving above the speed limit is safer I saw that there is something called the Solomon curve, found on Wikipedia: 

_URL_0_

I'm not sure how to interpret its entirety but from what I can understand it's research that claims driving faster than others means less chance of hitting other vehicles? ","It's all about your speed in relation to the other drivers on the road, and how many other drivers are forced to make alterations to their driving in order not to collide with you.

If the speed limit is 70 and you're creeping along at 40, you are massively obstructing traffic, causing every other driver to have to slam on the brakes as he approaches you and then change lanes to pass you, which greatly increases chances of an accident. Drivers are far more likely to tailgate you, as well.

On the other hand, if you're going 100, you are also at an increased risk of having an accident, but not by as much, since you're not slowing down the whole road, and you can generally stay in the left lane and pass people without problems, so long as you aren't weaving through traffic. Think of the German autobahn for how well this can work if cars actually keep right and pass on the left.

The absolutely safest thing to do is to keep at the speed of the flow of traffic. However, most drivers in the U.S. tend to think that the speed limits are set unreasonably low. So most tend to drive 5-10 mph over the limit on highways (and the police, when they're not hunting for quotas, generally recognize this and are unlikely to pull you over for it). So if you're actually driving exactly at the speed limit, you are obstructing traffic because you're too slow for the flow of traffic.",eli5

44xxnb,"What makes a sports team/city a ""big market"" and why is it such a positive quality when talking about where a player will sign? Just what it says. I constantly see that ""X player will sign with Y team because they are a bigger market than Z team.""","Big markets are those with large populations, like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles. Those teams usually have a lot of money (i.e. the Yankees payroll dwarfs that of the Pittsburgh Pirates). 

The money can come from lucrative cable deals, or expensive tickets. The bigger the city, the more corporations are based there. They buy box seats to entertain clients.

Another factor: A player in a ""big market"" potentially has more sponsorship/endorsement opportunities. For example, when LeBron James was making his decision to leave Cleveland, the New York Knicks tried to pitch themselves, saying LeBron's brand value could be worth more than a billion bucks.

And think about it this way, playing in a big city, and being a top player will likely give you a lot of recognition.

There are exceptions to this, of course. I don't think there are many people who haven't heard of Aaron Rogers in Green Bay. 

On the negative side for the 'small market' teams, they don't frequently win. I mean, Kansas City, which is small, sucked for almost 20 years before winning the World Series. 

And, it could be argued there is less for an athlete to do in a small market. I mean, the club scene in New York is probably 100 times that of KC. Plus, there is also the ability to be anonymous in a big market. I mean, Derek Jeter could walk down the street a lot of the times without being mobbed. It may not be easy for his to do that in a small market.",eli5

1vx6wr,"Why is Ukraine so interested in a deal with Russia economic wise when the European Union GDP dwarfs the Russian GDP? Germany GDP= 3.6 trillion, France GDP=2.77 trillion UK GDP= 2.44 trillion Italy GDP= 2.19 trillion Russia GDP= 1.85 trillion. 
I'm sure the European union can give Ukraine a very good deal.","There are multiple factors here that all come in to play:

1) Potential revenue vs current revenue.

The EU GDP may be huge, but it's currently spread across 28 countries who effectively compete with each other for resources and clients. This means that Ukraine would have to be on a competitive level with countries like Germany and Great Britain, which it simply isn't in terms of product quality and services, and it would take years of investment to get to that level. In contrast, their current economic output goes almost wholesale to Russia, which accepts lower-quality goods for lower prices. So if Ukraine focuses more on serving the EU market, Russia simply declares that it won't buy Ukraine products any more, putting thousands of factories and millions of workers out of business.

2) Energy Security

Europe is still heavily dependent on Russia for energy, primarily gas. Germany has a direct gas pipeline to Russia across the Baltic sea, bypassing Ukraine and Poland. A few years ago, when Ukraine couldn't pay its gas bill, Russia turned off their supply, which also cut off parts of Poland. If Ukraine moves to the EU, Russia will turn off this pipe again, and Ukraine will have to buy its gas from Germany, who bought it off the Russians, and then pay Poland to transport it to Ukraine. This makes the cost of gas exorbitantly expensive for the average Ukrainian. Remember that it's minus 20 Celsius there at the moment - they need this gas to live.

3) Corruption

The people who are currently rich in Ukraine got there through their dodgy deals with Russia, and its in their interest to keep things that way. Of course, the opposition aren't exactly white as snow, and the EU isn't a bastion of clean business and human rights either, but at present the corrupt capitalists in the West don't have the same influence in Ukraine as the corrupt capitalists from the East. 

4) Loss of sovereignity

Joining the EU isn't some swanky gentleman's club where you sip brandy while reading the Financial Times. It is a two-tier system where top members like France dominate entire sectors of policy-making, such as the Common Agricultural Policy. Therefore, if Ukraine joins it will be forced to acquiesce to the demands of the EU Councils; grow this, don't grow that, don't make this much, don't use those chemicals, stop selling things that cheap, blah blah blah. A country as poor as Ukraine will have a huge amount of rights taken away from it by the EU courts in the name of ""reforms"", which Ukrainians might not actually appreciate. 

As an example, when Poland joined in 2004 there were lots of talks about the huge economical reform that would happen thanks to the EU funds; all the roads and factories and houses that would be built, which would particularly help the impoverished eastern side of the country (bordering Ukraine). Then people read the small print and saw the 2000 new ""protected nature lands"" created by the EU that completely prevent any new development in order to preserve Poland's natural beauty. So the poor people in the countryside will never, ever benefit from the billions of euros pouring into the country, because they're legally prohibited from developing their region. Residents there simply see the EU as fat-cat tycoons helping rich people get richer, while poor people get shafted as always. 


5) Some people actually liked Communism

Under the old system, you were guaranteed a job and a flat until death. If you did well at school, university was free and you left with a Masters degree. You didn't worry about healthcare or pensions because the State would provide all of that for you. In fact, from the moment you were born, you didn't really have to worry because you knew the State would provide. Sure, you'd never have plasma TVs and holidays to Disneyland, but you'd have warm meals and a roof over your head - something that even today, millions of Americans either don't have access to, or live in fear of losing on a daily basis. 

The 1990s transition to a free economy was disastrous for these people. Sure, some people got rich and moved up the social ladder, but equally many suddenly found themselves without work, without money, without heating, without a pension or healthcare. Their kids had seen their parents being given an apartment and an education, but this new generation were deprived of that; they had to fight, to compete, to work for slave wages or no wages at all to try and gain access to the basic standard their parents were afforded. For them, Capitalism was a huge cheat, and Russia's promise of an ""economic bloc"" that will offer the rewards their parents enjoyed seems much better than the EU's pipe dream of a wealthy, middle-class Ukraine. This is the prevailing attitude in the Eastern half of Ukraine.

Summary:

Even if Ukraine joined the EU, the end result for many people will be no different; they'll still be poor and their jobs will be at risk, but by staying with Russia at least it's ""better the devil you know.""",eli5

I've seen pictures on news sites showing people lining up at ATMs because of the crisis. Are they withdrawing the cash so they ""maintain"" Euro funds for after Greece leaves/get kicked out of the Eurozone or are they hoping that the cash will ""work"" in Greece indefinitely?","The cash won't be useless if Greece does default and exit the EU. The cash will still be in Euro, which will most likely be a stronger, more stable coin than the coin Greece will end up adopting after they default.

5gwv32,"Why does smoke from cooking always set off the fire alarm, but recreational smoking does not? There has been parties where our house has gotten sufficiently boxed, mainly weed smoke, but the alarms never go off. Yet, if I burn one piece of toast, boom. 

Edit: spelling ","Okay, so basically a fire alarm is triggered by a smoke detector. There's two types- ionisation and photoelectric.
Ionisation smoke alarm works as a complete circuit uninterrupted in default form. Any smoke particles interrupt the flow of  current and results in an alarm ringing.


Photoelectric smoke alarm works with a constant glowing light (transmitter) and a receiver. The presence of a particle of smoke can be detected by the receiver if the light is blurred over by the smoke, and this triggers the alarm.


The main difference in these detectors aside from construction is that they are triggered by different sizes of particles of smoke. Cigarette smoke has the particle size of 0.3-0.5 microns which cannot be detected by the ionisation smoke detector whereas the smoke from cooking is denser and sets of the alarm easier.

Hope this answers your question.",eli5

Since Canada is so large and sparsely populated they claim it costs them more to provide equally priced and quality services to those in Toronto/Ottawa/Vancouver as it does for those living in the more rural areas of the country.

In reality it is bullshit.  If you look at the profit margins they are making and government tax breaks they really don't need to charge this much.  It's basically just greed.  That and they have lobbied the government so much that the laws work more in their favour.

2d7h6w,Why do my eyes water every time I yawn? ,"The tear film has three layers. The bottom layer is called mucin and acts very much like a glue to keep the tears from simply rolling off your eyes. The middle layer is the aqueous and is mostly salt water. The outermost layer is the lipid and is oily. The lipid oil keeps the tears from immediately evaporating. 

The tear fluids are created in small glands around your eyes and flow down tiny channels. 

You also have a tear drainage system called the punctum. You have one punctum in each upper and lower eyelid near the nose. These drain into the nasal cavity. 

In a healthy eye, tear fluids are constantly being produced, taken down channels to the eyes, lubricate and wash the eyes, and then drained out the punctum. 

When you yawn, you stretch the glands, channels, and punctum. Closing the punctum cause an overflow of tears, which will then roll down your cheeks. Squeezing the channels can squirt out all the fluid to the eyes, like too much mustard on a hot dog. Closing your eyes tightly can squeeze the tears already on the eye. This combination can produce tears when you yawn.",eli5

3dqh3g,Why are planets in the solar system all in the same plane? ,"Pictures are often simplifications used to explain hard concepts in easy ways. The planets aren't actually all in the same plane. But they're pretty close, because they all formed from the same gas cloud collapse that the Sun did, and everything in that cloud was roughly spinning the way the Sun does. The dust and rocks that were orbiting on other planes mostly crossed each other's paths, hit, and either fell into the Sun or got knocked into a more equatorial orbit. The reason not everything in the solar system spins the same way is for the same reason you can put backspin on a billiard ball. Angular momentum is conserved, but it doesn't have to be uniform. Some things can spin backwards if others spin forwards faster.

As for why electrons are different, it's because they're following a different law of physics that uses a different equation. Solar system accretion obeys gravity, and electron orbitals obey electromagnetism. In S1, Electrons actually ""orbit"" in a sphere, not a circle!",eli5

5cnop9,"Why do we focus on cutting down on causes of global warming instead of correcting the effects? Everything I've ever seen says we need to slow the effects of global warming, that the only option is to change the way we fuel and feed our society. While not discounting that this is important, shouldn't we also try to reverse the existing changes? Or is that simply beyond the realm of our science and cost efficiency?","You've actually got it backwards - we *do* correct the effects.  You have all sorts of government agencies constantly dredging channels, pumping water from low-lying areas, delivering water across large distances and so forth.  It's doubtful you've ever been anywhere that hasn't been subject to massive (and ongoing) modification by human beings over generations to make it more livable.

Indeed, this modification is so massive and ubiquitous that you don't even notice it.  You just assume that's the way world is without considering the enormous amount of work that has gone into making it that way.

In contrast, almost no one actually does much of anything to address the causes of global warming because we really can't.  We use the methods we do for a good reason: they're the most efficient methods we've yet found.  If you're rich enough, you can afford to step away from that efficiency a tiny bit, but it's only a very tiny bit until you run into harsh physical reality.

So what you're asking is ""why does everyone *talk* about dealing with causes rather than effects?"".  The answer to that is simple: they talk about the issue at the level they're able to understand it.  Relatively few people can intelligently talk about even a small portion of vast array of obscure projects that deal with keeping the world a livable place.  Pretty much anyone can hold an ideological opinion on whether cars should be powered by fossil fuels - especially when that ideological opinion has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not they are.",eli5

a6h2f1,why are anti material rifles better at destroying military equipment rather then anti personal? And what part of it makes it that way? ,"As other's have touched on, anti-material rifles fire significantly larger cartridges(bullet + powder) than normal anti-personnel rifles do, even if numerically the bullets seem to be similar in size.  A .308 Winchester round is 51mm long with a 12 gram bullet, but a .338 Lapua is 93mm long with a 19 gram bullet that leaves the muzzle with about 60% more energy

Another factor that makes these rifles better against equipment than normal ones that you have ammunition options.  Different bullets are suited for different jobs.  Sometimes punching holes in something will take it out but sometimes you need to kill it with fire

The standard 7.62x51mm round used in large NATO rifles primarily comes in variants of ""Ball"" rounds which are mostly lead and occasionally have a steel core to go through thin armor, there are some armor piercing rounds with tungsten cores and tracers but that's about as exotic as it gets.

The 12.7x99mm round(.50 BMG or 50 cal) has a ludicrous amount of ammo options.  You can get a Ball round, an armor piercing round, an incendiary round, an explosive round, or if you really want to bust something up you can use a [high explosive incendiary armor piercing round(HEIAP)](_URL_0_) which will punch through armor while exploding and lighting fluids on fire.

I know you technically *can* overdose, but it'd take something like smoking 17,000 lbs of weed in 15 mins or something obscene. Why does it take this much? What would theoretically start to happen to you as you smoke more and more in those 15 minutes?","To put it simply, it's because cannabinoid receptors aren't found in the brain stem, and therefor the toxicity of marijuana is extraordinarily high.

More basically, marijuana is dispersed in a very different way to opiates, and it doesn't affect the respiratory system very much. If you look at it's therapeutic index (40,000:1), you'll see a person has to take in 40,000 times the normal dose in order to overdose. 
This is likely due to a hormone in the brain called pregnenolone which is released when your cannabinoid receptors become active. Pregnenolone drastically impairs the ability for those receptors to function, so you need more marijuana to affect your receptors, which in turn releases more pregnenolone. It's a negative feedback loop. The more you take in, the less it effects you.

jkw86,"When I'm sleepy, why is rubbing my face and eye sockets vigorously one of the most desirable things to do? Feels so good and then I look like a druggy afterwards. ","The LY5 version is that the response serves three purposes:  
1. You massage the muscles around your eyes, which can relieve tension that builds up after a long computer session or some such.  
2. Your eyes can stop producing enough fluid, and rubbing them stimulates the production of that fluid (basically tears) and rubs it around to the dry areas.  
3. Last and most interestingly, increased pressure on your eyeball actually triggers a reflex that slows down your heart rate a bit to calm you down or prepare you for sleep.

I'm Finnish, and the main reason I'm amazed by English pronunciation is that Finnish is very regular, there are basically no exceptions when it comes to pronouncing. All the letters have only one correct way to pronounce them. This is why Finnish people are famous for speaking bad English.

When you go full screen Auto wants to pick High quality (720p). Unfortunately, the way that Youtube's technology is set up it seems to require you to reload the video.

Most websites will just stick with one quality (e.g. Vimeo might just start you at 720p by default). That way when you swap to full screen it doesn't need to reload anything.

3u0y77,Why do people die of old age? ,"Your cells become less effective at reproducing as they age. Eventually they lose the ability to be copied. Some cells also don't have the ability to reproduce very well, like neurons. Aging is a result of your cells and DNA getting replicated over a lifetime and slowly accumulating damage.

It's like photocopying a piece of paper several thousand times, eventually the image will degrade in quality. 

During cell division, the telomere, a stretch of DNA at each end of a chromosome becomes shorter. When the telomere becomes too short, it can no longer protect the cell’s DNA, leaving the cell at risk for serious damage. In most cells, telomere length cannot be restored. Extreme telomere shortening triggers an SOS response, and the cell will do one of three things: stop replicating by turning itself off; stop replicating by dying; or continue to divide, becoming abnormal and potentially dangerous (for example, leading to cancer).",eli5

6jxdaa,How does a tick cause a food allergy? ,"First you have to understand what an allergy is. Allergies are your immune system reacting to something it shouldnt. When you get sick symptoms such as runny nose and sneezing are caused by your bodies attempts to get rid of the germs that are actually making you sick. When your immune system mistakes something like pollen for something dangerous that is an allergic reaction.

 Your immune system learns over time from exposure how to better fight the things it's been exposed to. It 'remembers' the signs of the things that 'attacked' it before so that it can fight them off quicker.

Now tick bites can contain some things that are dangerous for you such as Rocky mountain spotted fever and many many other bad things. When you get a tick bite your immune system will likely have to fight off something if not several somethings. Because of this 'attack' on your body your immune system will try to remember what the signs were so it can be better prepared for the next 'attack'.

Ticks also feed on other animals such as deer. When you get bit by a tick that had fed on another animal not long before some of that animals blood may get sent in with the bad germs that your immune system had to fight off. Because of that your immune system may accociate some of the proteins from that animals blood with the nasty germs it had to fight off. Specifically a protein found in most meets we eat. Then when you eat a juicy steak the next week your immune system sees the same protein that came in with all the nasty germs from the tick bite and it flips out.

It's not all lost though because your immune system doesn't have a great memory so if you avoid eating anything with that protein in it for a year or so the immune system will forget about it.",eli5

23t4t7,"Why does doubling the frequency (going up 1 octave) of a note sound the ""same""? Is this just purely our brains doing crazy unconscious processing of the sound, or is there some physics behind the way frequencies work? I feel like just about anybody can tell if two notes played side by side are the same but different octaves, how?","2 things, basically. the way our ears work, and the way resonant vibration works.

**part 1, how does the ear work?**

Something vibrates the air. This is sound. The vibration travels, in waves, to your ear. The outer ear channels the vibrations inside, to the ear membrane, which transmits these vibrations to the inner ear.

Here's where it gets interesting. The inner ear is filled with fluid, and a bunch of tiny hairs. Some hairs are longer, and some hairs are shorter. When the fluid inside the ear vibrates, *some* hairs will also vibrate, but not all of them.

Long hairs will vibrate if they're exposed to low frequencies, and shorter hairs will vibrate when exposed to high frequencies. When they vibrate, they send signals to your brain. Your brain looks at which hairs are vibrating, and how intensely they're vibrating, and interprets these signals into a sound.

But, why do hairs vibrate in response to some frequencies, but not others? Why does this vibration depend on their length?

**part 2, resonant vibration**

Imagine pushing a child on a swing. If you constantly stood right behind the swing and pushed it, the swing wouldn't swing very much. On the other hand, if you only push the swing once every 10 minutes, it wouldn't go very high either. There's a middle ground - if you push the swing right as it comes to the end of it's arc, it gets higher and higher. This is because you're pushing the swing at its resonant frequency.

A sound vibrating hairs inside an ear does the same thing. for some hairs, it will be pushing too fast, for others, too slow. But, for some hairs, it will push *just right*, and that hair will vibrate a lot, like a swing being pushed at just the right rate.


**so, what about octaves?**
Imagine our swing again, but instead of pushing it every cycle, you pushed it every other cycle (you push at half the frequency). the swing would still go pretty high, right? In the same way, a frequency that triggers a certain hair will also trigger the hairs that are half as long (meant for the frequency an octave up).

So, a frequency that's double another frequency literally vibrates almost the same set of hairs inside your ear!

You can pick several different types of investments and spilt up your contribution a number of ways into one or more of them. Some do pretty good, others not so good depending on what the economy is like. Each one has different levels of risk so it’s a good idea to mix it up.

When you hit your mid to late 50’s you can start pulling money out and get taxed at the standard rate. If you pull it out earlier, you get taxed at a higher rate.

Pour the beer into a glass, and you won't notice. I always recommend pouring into a glass anyway. It allows the head to form, and the beer to breathe.

Enjoyment of beer flavor is usually due to age. Fresh beer is generally better than old. And I don't mean ageing. I mean how long it's been on the shelf. It's why draft almost always tastes better. It's newer.",eli5

9w2qwh,Why is blood red? ,"These answers get at ""how"". 

I'm going to try to explain ""why"". Blood isnt red so much as red is blood colored. 

Yes, the iron in our blood that bonds to oxygen much the way rusty iron does gives it it's reddish color. But *why is blood so brilliantly red*? Because we mammals first evolved color vision to make things that were really important stand out against the green and tan of the jungle and savannah. 

Blood is red because blood means things are serious. Either you've wounded prey and need to track it down as it dies ([humans are exhaustion stalking hunters – worth a read](_URL_2_)), or you or someone else is gravely injured. 

When your insides are on your outsides, its beneficial to have a sensor specially tuned to recognize exactly that liquid inside you. That's why animals with color vision and red blood often see red even if they don't see other colors well. Red color vision is tuned to our blood. 

In fact, there is rising evidence that [different human societies perceive different levels of color](_URL_1_) with different ease. 

New languages tend to evolve words for red first. Then green and blue is last. In fact, [there are a few societies alive today without a real word for blue](_URL_0_). But all can identify red.",eli5

6qkitj,Why is internet Explorer hated so much ,"The hate mostly comes from Internet Explorer 6 which was a decent browser for its time. But Microsoft had crushed Netscape in the Browser Wars and saw little need to continue to innovate on the product and so they didn't. There were five years between IE6 and IE7: five long, buggy, security-hole-filled years. IE6 was a security nightmare and it was really common for new security flaws to be discovered all the time and Microsoft was really, really slow to patch them. It was also difficult to get patches out in the early days of the internet, so people could be running unsafe versions and never know it. It also lacked many of the innovations that smaller browsers were integrating at the time, liked tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking and addons/extensions. 

Another reason it was so reviled was because it was so integrated into Windows. You could open a File Explorer window and type a URL into the address bar and it would seamlessly switch the window to Internet Explorer. You can then do it to go back to file browser. Of all of the features of IE, I actually miss this one the most. But this integration made it really, really difficult for competitors to compete. When something is so integrated into the OS that you cannot even uninstall it without breaking the OS, how are you going to compete? That integration was another issue: IE often worked in the background, delivering web-based content to the desktop (Active Content, Active Desktop, etc) and so even if you didn't even use IE as your daily driver browser, you still used it without realizing it and you were still susceptible to its bugs and its security flaws. You couldn't even use Windows Update without using IE until a recent version of Windows (Vista I think) because WU was built on IE technology.

IE also tried to break the web. Microsoft's design software for years (I don't know if they still do this), has been Triple-E: Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. Using this philosophy, they'd enter into some new software field (the Embrace), they would innovate and add features and stuff that doesn't exist in that field now (the Extend), and then Extinguish all of their competitors in the field because the community has grown dependent on the extensions they've added. This lead to an era where websites would work on IE but not work on Netscape or Opera or Firefox because it uses code, styling, or scripting that is exclusive to Internet Explorer. You'd constantly see these little badges on websites like ""Best viewed in IE!"" ""Best viewed in Netscape Navigator!""

It also hung around for a fuck lot longer than it should have, contributing to continued security issues in the modern era. Internet Explorer 6 was so bad and has had such a shit legacy that it permanently stained the IE name. More recent versions of IE aren't terrible browsers but it's become such a laughing stock that they've had to retire the name, hence Edge.",eli5

4qs1ok,Why do we feel relief from confessions?,When you put your feelings into words you experience an increased response in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. This is responsible for your emotional processing abilities. When this area of your brain is active there is a reduced response in the amygdala. The amygdala is an almond-shaped set of neurons located deep within the temporal lobe of the brain and is responsible for autonomic responses associated with fear and fear conditioning. So when you're confessing things or venting you are able to process the situation more rationally and significantly reduce the anxiety and fear associated with it.,eli5
16z79p,"Why is displaying the Confederate Flag considered socially-acceptable? I seem to be missing something, because I often see it being displayed on bumper stickers and other signs. I live in Utah, so it's not like I live in the South. I know that some people just consider it to be a symbol of Southern pride, but it seems like a huge middle-finger to me. Why not find some other symbol that isn't also linked to slavery and treason? 

I feel like it's impossible to separate that symbol from racism. It's like, if someone insisted on getting a swastika tattoo and said, ""I don't mean it as an anti-Semitic thing; it means 'good luck' in many cultures, after all!"" Like, I totally wouldn't buy that unless that person was raised in a religious tradition where the swastika had deep, immutable meaning before Hitler came along. To me, it would seem like a thinly-veiled excuse to be an anti-Semitic piece of shit.

Or, to put it another way, the excuse of ""Southern pride"" seems like a euphemism for pro-slavery, much in the way that Southerns complaining about the North ""destroying their way of life"" was a euphemism for ""we want slaves, ok?"" They don't want to come out and say it, so they say ""Southern pride"" instead.

Like, it's unfathomable to me that there can even exist an explanation for this. Where have I gone wrong?","The Confederacy was not inherently evil, they were just unfortunate to stand by a choice that, by modern standards, is evil.  

At the time, the United States wasn't all that united.  They mostly saw themselves as a individual states, much like how the member states of the European Union are still very unique.  Because of that mentality, the idea of the federal government calling the shots was resented.  Why should someone in Illinois decide how someone in South Carolina should live?  For example, let's say the Federal Government wanted to go to war with the United Kingdom.  The states bordering the Canadian/American border would probably not like the idea because their economy might rely on border trading, and because those are the state where the war will take its toll.  Unfortunately for them, if all the other states vote yes, then they're fucked.  So, this is a situation where a state like Texas, which has no ties to Great Britain nor are they anywhere near the Canadian border, can really screw up everything for a state like New York.

The South's economy relied on slaves.  The South's industry was not as strong as the North's, and so they relied on agriculture, and therefore slaves.  The North did not need slaves, and in fact most northern states had already banned it.  So, if the federal government banned slaves, then it really wouldn't affect the North, but it could destroy the South.  There were more representatives in the Northern states, so such a law would pass.  So here is a situation where people in the North had the power to destroy the lives of the people in the South.  This is why the South seceded and why the Civil War started.

The only reason why the Confederacy is seen as evil is because the main issue that the North and South did not agree with was slavery.  It could easily have been something else, such as taxes, or foreign policy, or Indian policy, or anything other than slavery, but no, it had to be slavery.  Naturally, any side that chooses slavery would seem evil to us, but that's just how the cards fell.  In the end, many Southerners did not see the Civil War as a fight to keep slavery, but as a fight to give themselves the power to govern themselves.  So, that's why displaying a Confederate flag is not seen as racist.  It is a reminder to Southerners of when they stood up for themselves.  In a way, they fought the good fight, but for the wrong reasons.",eli5

59gxfl,"What do roller coasters do to the chemistry in some people's brains that causes them to think their going to die, while in other it simply gives them a rush? ","The only difference between fear and excitement is the way you think about it. Adrenaline causes the same biological response whether you're on Team Excitement or Team This-Is-How-I-Die. Do you *expect* to be scared? You probably will feel scared. Do you *expect* to have fun? You probably will have fun.

This premise has been distilled into a lot of Pinterest-y bullshit, and saying that the difference is psychological doesn't make the answer less simple. There are a lot of learned assumptions, unconscious decisions, risk tolerances, etc. For example, if you have a hard time tolerating anxiety, any adrenaline response might seem scary and unbearable. If you grew up in a home where risk is bad and the world is a scary place, fear might be your automatic response to adrenaline. On the other hand, if you associate adrenaline with fun or a thrill (i.e. goofing around when you were a kid, playing sports, etc.), you might not see the adrenaline response as a sign of a threat.",eli5

64mptw,Why do mathematicians care about ridiculously large prime numbers?,"Modern encryption relies on prime numbers:

*Primes have very special properties for factorization. One of those properties is that while it is relatively easy to find larger prime numbers, it’s unavoidably hard to factor large numbers back into primes. It’s one thing to figure out that 20 is (2 * 2 * 5), and quite another to figure out that 2,244,354 is (2 * 3 * 7 * 53,437). It’s quite another again to find the prime factors of a number fifty digits long. Though the best mathematicians have chewed on the problem for hundreds of years, there just doesn’t seem to be any way to factor large numbers efficiently.*

*That fact makes primes vitally important to communications. Most modern computer cryptography works by using the prime factors of large numbers. The large number that was used to encrypt a file can be publicly known and available, because the encryption works so only the prime factors of that large number can be used to decrypt it again. Though finding those factors is technically only a matter of time, it’s a matter of so much time that we say it cannot be done. A modern super-computer could chew on a 256-bit factorization problem for longer than the current age of the universe, and still not get the answer.*

m8cr8,How will Greek/Italian default and possible breakdown of Eurozone affect the US and other countries? You guys gave me a GREAT breakdown of the Greek debt crisis last week.  Now I'd like to know why I should be worried about it.,"As Peter-W says - it's all a house of cards really.  Each bank borrows money from other banks and sells on debts.  If Greece defaults (which is what it is kind of doing anyway) then it won't pay back its debts and many banks throughout the world will be out of pocket.

So with the sweets analogy that we did last week, what really happens is that when you borrow sweets off someone else, they decide that they don't want to be in debt of the sweets.  So they sell the debt to someone else, usually at a slightly lower rate.  So if you borrow 10 sweets off me, with the promise to give me back 15 next week, I will decide that this isn't really good enough for me, so I'll borrow 11 sweets off someone else with the promise to pay back the 15 in two weeks.

This results in you getting 10 sweets now, me getting 1 sweet now (the 11 I was lent minus the 10 I lent you) and someone else getting 15 sweets in two weeks when you pay back.  Plus I have the bonus of having a week in between getting the sweets from you and giving them to the other borrower - so for one week I have 1 sweet, then for one week I have 16 sweets, then I'm back down to 1 sweet after two weeks.  The person I've borrowed 11 sweets off does it at a lower rate because I'm a big bank and I can afford to pay them back even if you can't pay me back all of the 15 sweets.  The people who do this sort of borrowing do it on the basis that the gains won't be as good in the long term, but that the risk is much lower.  These sorts of people tend to be pension providers - lots of small long term gains is great for pensions (where losing all the money is not an option), but not so good for short term investment.  I can, of course, reinvest my one sweet and make more sweets out of it.

As a big bank, I've obviously written it into my contract with you that if you don't pay me back all 15 sweets, I'll take most of the hit, but the other borrower will take some too.  In the case of Greece, a week later when it turned out they didn't have 15 sweets, they are proposing paying back somewhere between 7 and 10 of the 15 sweets they owe and not for another two weeks.  If it is 7 sweets that you give me back, my bank is now 8 sweets out of pocket.  But I've agreed some liability with the other borrower, so I'll only pay back 7 of those sweets.  The end result is that you have had 10 sweets for a week and are going to give back 7 in two weeks.  I had 1 sweet for a week and now you are going to give me 7 in two weeks time, but in one weeks time I'm going to have to pay back 14 to my borrower.  The person who borrowed off me wants their 15 sweets in a weeks time, which I'm now going to tell them is only 14 sweets.  Even though the borrower is still making 14 sweets out of 10 sweets profit, they were expecting 15 sweets, so this is effectively a loss to them.

So that is the long and the short of it all.  Even though most of the immediate debt is to European countries (some of it is external), the knock on effect will hit all countries.",eli5

You can read my long boring rant, or watch this excellent HBO Vice documentary and you will get the gist 

_URL_0_

First and foremost, you have to understand the citizenary of NK. They are born into a society that is developed to repress independent thinking. NK citizens are conditioned to believe some pretty outrageous things. (ie: Kim Jong Un is a deity and the world outside NK is villainous and apocalyptic). So when you are a NK adoloscent and think about questioning an idea from your teacher, you are also questioning the idea of a living diety who is your leader and pruportedly the only thing from saving you from the outside world of villany and demise. Consider that there are even cities and stores in NK that are designed to look nice to create the illusion that the NK is propsering, when in reality, many of these cities are gohst towns, uninhabited by anyone except government employees whose job is to maintain the illusion. But even the low level government employees are probably conidtioned to believe that these ghost towns have a real purpose. The power and understanding of the truth is held to a very small subsect of rulers. Anyway, the point is that the minds of NK citizens have been conditioned to believe a lie since birth. Breaking this spell is not easy. 


Think about your childhood, even growing up in the US for example, you are subject to some sorts of more passive conditioning. Whether from your parents or a role model or religous leader or a teacher there were probably ideas that you believed as a kid, that you began to question and ultimately decide you did not believe. 

Now lets say you start to have these considerations in NK. You decide, ""fellas, maybe we should go to the US and find out if its as bad as we are told?"". And you decide you want to talk about these concerns with someone. Well, you better hope that this someone believes as you do, because if they dont and they report you to authorites then you and your family will likely be imprisoned or excuted for treason. Okay, you dont want to have a social revolution, you just want to leave NK. Also, likely that your family will get in serious trouble for your misconduct. 

Also, consider that this country is severely isolated, as they let no foreign people in. Imagine, your friends that live in a small country town and how unrefined and unaware they were when they moved to their first big city or to college. Now multiply that effect onto the country scale and cut all internet  and tv ties to the outside world. And any tv that has been watched, promotes the state of NK. 

Try to imagine your mind and the emotional despair that life would be like in this scenario, growing up in such circumstances ( also not that you are probably insanely poor and are just struggling to survive). The likelihood of you assassinating the man who is touted (by everyone you know and respect) as a god who protects you from the outside world is very unlikely. 

If you do end up overcoming this mental and emotional repression, you have to ask yourself this. How is a severely under educated farm boy who is barely surviving on a few grains of rice per day going to assassinate a man who has elite trained body guards (whose families lives depend on them protecting KJU). Do you think they aren't motivated to stop you? Its not like you can access a library and read about bombs or go on the internet  and search assassination attempts ( you have no internet, you actually have no idea how to use a computer). You have yourself, and some rice, good luck.",eli5

1. The image you see on the screen isn't actually that good. Maybe because of its small size. Maybe because it is in motion and your mind is compensating. Grab a movie with an intense action scene and then look at a single frame of the car flying through a plate glass window... its probably super-blurry. It is only with the other 30 frames around it that your mind can fill in the details and understand the scene.

1ofq7n,"Why do humans, for the most part, tend to find unhealthy foods more satisfying than food which is good for you? I tried searching, and couldn't find anything on this sub.

Couldn't our taste buds have ""evolved"" to prefer foods that are good for us (vegetables as opposed to chocolate, for example)? The laws of nature state that a species which chooses to damage itself consistently (or cannot avoid doing so) isn't fit to survive, right? Wouldn't enjoying the taste of healthy food help ensure our survival?

It seems similar to a situation where a zebra wandered regularly into an area where a bunch of lions roam, for no reason other than that it enjoys being in that area. Eventually, after a whole bunch of zebras get mauled, the other zebras would get the idea, wouldn't they? They'd stop going there, they'd keep their offspring from going there so the species can continue on, etc.

I'm no biology expert, so if I have anything wrong, please feel free to tell me exactly what. Just be nice. Please?","Evolution takes millions of years.  Modern humans have only been around for a couple hundred thousand. The problem is that unhealthy foods, those high in sugar or fat, were really hard to find for prehistoric humans.

9znhm8,why humans are the only animals that need to brush their teeth,"Our diets coat our teeth in sugar and other substances that are conducive to bacterial growth. Because those bacteria harm our teeth, we brush.

In the past, our diets contained far fewer sugars, starches and much more fibre. That means less of the bad stuff that promotes bacterial growth and more fibre that more or less ""flosses"" your teeth as you chew it.

Generally speaking, animals don't eat diets so loaded with sugar and other substances that promote bacterial growth as humans do. A New Zealand zoo recently stopped feeding their animals modern fruits. Most of the fruits we eat are selectively grown to maximise sweetness. The zoo found that human grown fruits are so sugary these days that they made the zoo animals fat and rotted their teeth. Just like what happens to our teeth when we don't brush.

Animals still face dental problems though. Their diets usually prevent sugar/bacteria caused problems. But infected teeth, broken teeth and so on can still spell disaster for an animal. Predators with teeth or jaw problems often can't kill efficiently and as a result, starve or start looking for easier prey. The main problem many mammalian herbivores face is their teeth literally wearing down over their lifetime. Elephants for instance face death from starvation because they can easily grow old enough for their teeth to wear down to the point where they can't chew.

This is also why so many species find alternative solutions. Sharks, for instance, have disposable teeth, they constantly grow new teeth to replace lost teeth. Rodents have teeth that never stop growing. Lots of species have alternatives for teeth like beaks, bony plates, or complex mouthparts like insects and arachnids.

Some animals barely use their teeth at all and swallow rocks to grind their food to mulch with stomach contractions.

But to get back to the brushing thing, the main reason modern humans brush their teeth is that we have awful diets.",eli5

**[P]** The *anxiety* part is a bit more tricky. When you *'think'* you might need to *flee*, even when there is no normal cause, your body still reacts.

1mndyw,Why do Americans get such huge tax refunds every year? Being from a country that does not give out thousands to average people every year this puzzles me.,"American taxes are pre-paid throughout the year -- they are withheld from paychecks by employers, who pay the government based on an estimate of what people say they will owe. At the end of the year, the employees each file a tax return, state exactly what they should have paid, and get back the difference.

Most Americans have done a crappy job estimating their tax obligation and have excessive withholdings. A trip to the HR department and a completed W-4 form would reduce refunds, and give them more of that money up front.

There's also one other element: refundable tax credits. American politics won't accept generous ""welfare"" programs, so some aid for poor families comes instead in the form of ""negative taxes"" -- where you get back more than you paid in. The main example is the Earned Income Credit -- a reward for poor parents working.",eli5

2sltr8,"If a picture of Muhammad is not allowed because it is seen as idol worship then how is something like the Kaaba and the Black Stone with their dedicated ceremony not seen as something similar, and why are there many ancient depictions of Muhammed in middle eastern art? ","Because the Kaaba and the Black Stone aren't being treated as something to worship.

The idea with pictures of Muhammad and Allah is that people would become confused and pray to the pictures/statue rather than praying to Muhammad or Allah. The same way that people get confused between praying to God and praying to a statue or picture of Jesus.

They don't bow down in the direction of the kaaba because they worship it, they bow in that direction because that's where God sent the Black Stone and essentially marked out ""This location is where I connect to the Earth"". It's essentially the difference between looking to a flag during a ceremony and realizing that you are doing so because that flag is the physical representation of the group, and not because you are revering the flag itself.

As for ancient depiction of Muhammad, there are still modern depictions of Muhammad. Sunni Muslims, who make up the majority of Islam, think that by and large you shouldn't have pictures for the aforementioned reasons. Shia/Shiite Muslims don't have such problems, it's actually quite common for there to be pictures and even small statuettes of Muhammad that are used to demonstrate who he was. The same way that some Christians will have a necklace with Jesus on it.

6ke17x,"Why is it recommended to guess the same letter when running out of time during a multiple choice test? I guess I can sort of see why this method works, but I can't explain it, which makes me wonder if there are actual statistics and mathematics to prove how. Besides this method being faster than randomly guessing for each answer, supposedly this method *should* result in a higher percentage of correct answers. My intuition agrees, but when I think about it, wouldn't every guess on a question have an equal 25% chance of being correct? Can someone please prove or disprove this and explain why? ","On a twenty question test, suppose you've answered 16 of the questions the best you can, but have no clue on the last four--you can't eliminate a *single* answer. 

For each individual question, an answer has a 25% chance of being right, so if you pick B, 1/4 times you'll be correct. The formula for looking at multiple questions will be

   >   p(r) = nCr * p^r * q^(n-r)
    

where
 > r=# of questions

 > nCr=# needed correct (which can be 1, 2, 3, or 4), or n! / r!(n-r)!

 > p is probability of getting an answer correct, .25

 > q is probability of getting an answer incorrect, .75

So the probability of getting **all four** correct is 0.00390625 - or, low. The probability of getting **one or more** right is 0.68359375, or, pretty good. The likelihood of getting all four answers wrong is (3/4)^4 = 0.31640625 (alternatively, 1-0.68359375)

Looking at the specifics of your question, it comes from most tests not being truly random. A handwritten test with human selected answers will not be random, which is where things like 'guess C always' come from. 

A computer generated test will be random, and because each question is independent from another, it doesn't really matter what answer you pick.",eli5

54n5jd,Why do some countries have different birth rates between men and women? Why is it that countries like China have a massive difference between men and women with men being born so much more often. Then there are some like Ukraine with fewer men? Does this have something to do with culture?,"The actual conception rate of male and female babies is pretty much identical around the world.

In some countries, it is more desirable to have a particular sex of child. China is a good example. When the Chinese government implemented the One Child Policy, adoption rates of baby Chinese girls skyrocketed. This is because in Chinese culture, a male is viewed as more important than a female. So for the parents who are only allowed to have one child, they want to ensure it is the gender they want. 

There is also selective neglect. Similar to the above, some countries feel that having a male is better for the family as a whole. Take parts of Africa, for example. When speaking of very poor African countries, they have little to no access to birth control, meaning they will inevitably birth a lot of children. However, male children tend to grow to be stronger, play a bigger and more important role in the tribe/community, etc. If the family already has low funds and nourishment to begin with, the bulk of the nourishment will go to the child that the family believes will have the highest success rate, and who will be able to support them in their old age.",eli5

- (1) Written rules for the way money will be distributed among people according to future events.

- (2) A strong guarantee that the written rules will be followed.

Traditionally (1) is accomplished by a piece of paper written in English (or French or Spanish or whatever), and (2) is accomplished by living in a country where the government has a legal system whose purpose is basically to stomp on anyone who doesn't follow the rules.

With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, we've figured out how to utilize a vast network of computers for (2).  For (1), Bitcoin only allows a few simple ways to redistribute money (and most people will only ever use the simplest, ""send to this person"").  But Ethereum has figured out how to let the written rules in (1) be basically anything that can be expressed in computer code (since Ethereum is ""Turing complete"", it can understand basically any computer code).",eli5

1deoy3,"Why has the African continent experienced such chaos, corruption and strife over the years? It seems like there's been one conflict after another over most of the continent in recent memory, can anyone explain why this is?","There's no single simple answer. It's a combination of factors that entire books have been written on. My attempt at the ELI5 version of the major contributing factors:

**Imperialism**: This isn't the biggest current factor, but it sets a historical stage that leads to a lot of the problems that persist. Largely during the 19th century, when various European powers were carving up the continent to build their empires, they drew a lot of otherwise fairly arbitrary lines based on what territory they could hold and defend from each other. This means that a lot of culturally similar regions got divided, and a lot of culturally distinct tribes suddenly found themselves lumped together and being told they were part of the same country. The cultural traditions that were imposed by the Europeans do persist to some degree, but were not entirely successful in homogenizing the cultures or forming a true sense of national identity in many cases. Also, some of the European traditions were simply incompatible with the local cultures, and all this leads to a generally unstable situation.

**Geography**: Africa is a huge continent. The environments are widely varied, and difficult to tame. A lot of the agricultural practices and crops that Europeans brought with them simply don't work out of the box in much of the African environment. During imperialist phases of history, this led to a lot of problems for the Europeans in creating stable economic situations.

**Disease**: Africa is ravaged by it. Without the wealth to invest in really effectively combating the various diseases that run rampant across the continent (e.g. Malaria, and AIDS), a lot of the potential productivity gets destroyed by otherwise healthy people succumbing to disease, and a lot of resources being sunk into the effort of caring for them. This isn't helped by foreign influences actively sabotaging attempts to contain the problem (e.g. the Catholic church actively propagandizing throughout the continent that condoms cause aids rather than prevent it).

**Exploitation**: Africa is a very resource rich continent, but due to the geographic challenges, it's difficult to get the value out of those resources. Most foreign nations and companies were/are only interested in extracting the resources and exploiting lax regulatory conditions in Africa. So a lot of the wealth being generated by these resources is being exported to foreign interests, and not being used to invest in nation building or stabilizing the local economies. This is not helped by the next factor.

**Corruption**: Not all countries are corrupt to the same degree, but governments throughout the continent are struggling with deeply entrenched corruption. Once it gets into all branches of a government, it becomes impossible for that government to fix itself. So a culture of bribery, favor trading, and selling out communal interests for personal gain is the norm, and there isn't much any single idealist can do to root out the problem without getting shut down by all the people in power who are interested in maintaining the status quo. Bribes become like tips that are expected with a nudge and a wink from everyone in order to get anything done, from the cops to the guy who stamps the form for you at the airport.

Once a nation becomes corrupt, progress tends to stagnate, as any wealth being generated that could be invested in improving the country's future gets absorbed by the guys in charge, or exported. Any time a nation starts to pull itself together, it becomes a ripe target for exploitation which sabotages the progress.

**Warlords and Dictators**: When you have a weak nation with a weak central government, a lot of weapons and militia or mercenaries available, lots of tribal disputes and rivalries that go back generations, and plenty of profit to be made for whoever is in charge of the country that may be sitting on lots of natural resources, you have a recipe for military coups waiting to happen. Even the ones that start out idealistic enough, like the revolutions for independence from the imperial powers, mentioned earlier, generally end up with a single totalitarian government in charge in the long run.

So this all adds up to a generally unstable situation across the continent where any progress or hope that starts to find a foothold can be sabotaged or simply fall apart due to the general instability of neighbors on all sides. I don't think it's any accident that most of the more stable and successful countries tend to be the coastal ones, or ones on the Nile/Lake Victoria with direct access to ports where they can effectively trade with more stable countries abroad without having to rely on land-routes through other war-torn regions. The process of failure tends to be self-perpetuating, though progress is possible (albeit exceedingly slow and fragile).",eli5

ujli1,What is the Euro crisis? Why is it happening? How bad is this? ,"In the beginning, the Euro nations in an effort to become economically stronger, developed the European Union. At first, borders between nations opened, and things were going well. So well in fact that they decided to develop one currency called the Euro. Not all EU nations had to adopt the Euro, but it seemed like a good idea. The currency became strong, reliable and able to compete with the U.S. Dollar and the British Pound. The result was that nations in the EU and adopted the Euro economically prospered together (essentially/economically the Euro countries became one nation, the Eurozone).

Now since the Eurozone became strong and properous they didn't want nations that had tons of debt or poor government to join. Letting nations that were economically poor, or government had a lot of debt would run the risk of ruining the Eurozone. So the Eurozone set up standards that all nations within must maintain such as Debt to GDP ratio had to be less than a certain percent, Deficits to GDP had to be less than a certain percent (can't remember at the moment).

So here comes Greece. They follow the standards required to join the Eurozone and get accepted. Now that they are a part of the Eurozone they get to enjoy one of the main benefits of being a Eurozone nation. Low interest rates for government debt. Since the Eurozone was such an economically strong nation, investors knew if they loaned money to it (invest in bonds) they can reliably expect to get their money back! So the investors charge less interest since they have less risk.

Knowing this, Greece goes on a spending spree since it can borrow cheaply. They start issuing government bonds denominated in the Euro, getting billions of dollars, hiring more public workers, undertaking more public works projects and for a time things were good.

However, this behavior was unsustainable. Greece had no way of paying back the debt. It was common for Greeks to avoid paying taxes by paying off tax collectors! So without any revenue stream for Greece, investors began to worry. How is Greece supposed to pay back its debt? In reality, it couldn't. This started worrying the rest of the Eurozone. If Greece defaults, it actually means that the Eurozone defaults. Investors will dump the government bonds of other Eurozone nations raising interest rates significantly sending the economy into a severe recession!

Now begins the talks with Greece. France and Germany (economic powerhouses in the Eurozone) and other nations sit and talk with Greece to work out a plan to bring their spending levels/debt down (austerity measures). What does this mean? Well first off, cut the fat. Fire all the unnecessary government workers, which unfortunately meant a lot of teachers (where I read somewhere the ratio was 6 students to 1 teacher) and street cleaners (where I also read were making 6-figure salaries). Second, actually collect taxes and eliminate the corruption. Both these measures sent Greece into a depression. So now you can see why people would be pissed in Greece: Their government fucked up the economy and now they have to pay taxes with jobs they just got fired from.

However lets view this from the perspective of Germany. Germans are very hardworking and industrious people. They've worked hard for decades to bring their economy up from the ashes of WWII to an economic powerhouse.  Well now Greece is messing up their whole scheme. Greece's debt is essentially Germany's debt and from a German perspective, they have to continue working hard (or even harder) so that Greeks don't have to pay taxes. Now the German's are pissed.

What are the effects of this? Within the Eurozone, many countries have been downgraded by rating agencies. Now nations have to borrow at higher interest rates than they otherwise would have. Investor confidence continues to wane as uncertainty as to what will happen is predominant. For the world, it's a jittery market, if the Euro does collapse it could send the world into another recession.

So who's fault is this whole crisis? Depends on who you ask I guess. Who were the people who should've dived into the financial book keepings of Greece (I think Greece either had poor book keeping or cooked the books, can't remember). Why weren't they held up to the standards outlined for membership? (In fact, none of the nations were actually within the standards). Then there are the other PIIGS nations (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain) who are responsible as well.

So this is just a quick glance over the Euro crisis with a focus on Greece from the perspective of an American. There are other details within the story I glossed over or wasn't accurate about, but to get a holistic understanding you should research the other parts of the story which include the stories of the other PIIGS (I mostly did research on Greece, so I can't tell you much about the other nations) or ask a European.

If that's the case, why isn't there a master master key for every single lock ever.","How does a normal [pin tumbler lock](_URL_0_) work in the first place? It works by pushing up the pins such that the break in the pins match the spot where the cylinder turns. A wrong key will push the pin at the wrong height, and when you try to turn the cylinder, instead of meeting the break, it'll hit the pin.

A master key does the exact same thing. A lock can be made to accept multiple keys by breaking the pins into more than 2 pieces - for example, with 2 breaks in one set of pins, the cylinder can turn at 2 different heights.

So a set of locks that share a master key all have breaks in the pins that fit that master key. The second break depends on the individual key the lock is designed for.",eli5

38ltnu,Why does grease make paper permanently translucent? ,"Paper is not your ""typical"" solid, instead it is actually made up of a [bunch of fibers](_URL_1_) tightly pressed together, this is why it is so easy for liquids to be absorbed by it (""Permeability"").

The reason paper is usually not see-through in the first place, is when light hits this mess of of intertwined fibers, the light will bounce around off of other fibers (""Refraction""), and probably end up reflecting back [in another direction](_URL_0_). If that light bounces back at your eyes, then it appears to you as being opaque.

The amount of refraction occurring depends on the differences of ""refractive index"" between two materials. If you were to dip this paper in water, the water would permeate the spaces between the fibers, changing the effective refractive index going on inside of the paper. In the case of translucency, this means that some light can now get through and not as much is reflected back.

However as soon as this water evaporates, the refractive index returns to its original state. Grease has a notably different refractive index to water, which could cause a more prominent translucency. Grease would also have the benefit of staining the paper, and not being so easily removed or evaporating.",eli5

12825i,Why do major newspapers make political endorsements? It seems like making an endorsement should hurt your publication's credibility. I just don't understand why this is normal.,"There are supposed to be two sides of a newspaper, one is a news side which is supposed to be unbiased and impartial. The other side is an opinion side, where the newspaper editors publish their own opinion through editorials on so called opinion pages. 

Mostly this tradition of these two sides has been honoured, it also supposedly extends into television news media. However, like tv news, the line has been decidedly blurred between unbiased reporting and opinion slanting towards the left or right. 

So basically they are allowed to give their opinion on the matter because that's simply what it is, an opinion, they are also supposed to give an in depth analysis of why they lean one way or another. With facts and details that lead them to side with this or that candidate, however with the line blurred as mentioned earlier, newspapers do often have an agenda and typically the readers of any particular paper lean with the direction of the paper they are reading. So in the end it's pretty much a ""preaching to the choir"" moment and they do not sway many in the end.",eli5

It's trying to rally the troops (white blood cells and such) to attack the source.

There are some technical hangups like having to duplicate certain wires on both sides of the connector but that's more a design nuisance than a real technical problem.

USB has been notorious for issues with plugging it in wrong-side up since it's earliest days but the difficulty of creating and getting everyone to agree to use a standardized connector is such that no one bothered to try to fix it.

Apple may not have come up with the idea of a reversible connector but they made the idea of one popular with ""Lightning"" the standard connector for the iPhone et all. Apple has the philosophy of using proprietary connectors whenever they can get away with it, so they had the upside of being able to develop lightning without needing to pass it by any standards bodies first. In other words less red tape.

USB-C was released partly as an answer to it, and partly to meet European law that mandates that all cellphones use the same charging connector. A law that Apple lobbied strongly against.",eli5

The problem is that it's expensive and hard for test for every known chemical. Even tests are not always accurate and testing can become expensove. New chemicals are always being added to the list. On top of that, there are many lawyers who go around testing products and suing those who do not comply. It usually leads to quick out of court settlements. 

In many cases, its much easier and cost effective to just label everything. There is no penalty for overlabelling. But there is a high risk if you don't label even if the item doesn't have any known chemicals that cause chemicals. So many companies play it safe and just label everything. As a result some complain now that labels don't really mean much. It's hard to tell if company is just playing it safe or if they really have cancer causing chemicals (usually lead or cadmium or phthalates).

zjihw,Why has the cost of college risen so much faster than inflation? Computers? Expensive doodads for research?,"Student Loans.

The reason most people don't go around buying really expensive things like sports cars, etc. is because most people cannot get the money to pay for it.  They don't have enough savings or they can't get a loan for it, because they don't make enough money to make the payments.  And the reason they can't get a loan is because when you're unable to make the payments, you can declare bankruptcy and all of your loans go away (you could lose some of your property in the process though, like your house and car).

But student loans are different from any other type of loan.  You don't have to prove that you'll be able to pay back the loan, because student loans are the only type of loan exempt from bankruptcy.  That means that you **will** pay back the money so long as you are alive, even if it means taking your tax refunds, garnishing your wages, etc.

So, there's basically no risk to the lenders.  They can give you as much student loan money as you want, and at a low interest rate, because the only way for you to avoid paying them back is to die, and almost all people choose paying loans over death.

Since you can borrow as much money as you want, there's no reason for colleges to keep tuition rates low.  They can keep increasing tuition, and people will still attend because it's really hard to get a good job without college.

If student loans did not exist, then colleges couldn't keep increasing tuition, because most people wouldn't be able to afford it, and then the colleges wouldn't have enough income to pay their own bills.

An alternate solution might be to allow student loans to be wiped out in a bankruptcy (just like every other type of loan).  This would make the interest rate a lot higher, so people wouldn't be willing to take out such large loan amounts so it'd have a similar effect at keeping tuition costs down.",eli5

Seriously though, it is. Flight/Fight fucks with your ability to think rationally. You know all the shit that soldiers have to put up with during Basic training and drills? A lot of it is there so that they can learn to control Flight/Fight, because in a firefight, you still need to be able to think and deal with tactics/strategy to whatever extent is possible.

You place a civilian in a combat situation with no training, and they are dealing with their body telling them to book it or headbutt the motherfucker. Not everyone has a natural ability to handle that kind of pressure.

In general, Pressure fucks with your ability to think rationally, and the feeling of being 'rushed' or 'pressed' for time means that when the decision is made, its highly likely that there was less thought put into it than would be normally. This is also why skilled/experienced leaders in *any* pressure role are so valuable - they know how to make decisions, while under pressure, while still retaining enough 'cool' to take into consideration the consequences of said decision.",eli5

3bkszb,Why eyes roll back into the head as a pleasure reflex Why do our eyes roll back in our heads when experiencing extreme pleasure?,"Contrary to the ~~above~~ below answer, here's the real one. (It's partially correct, as you'll see, but the mechanism is all wrong.)

When you faint, your body experiences a loss of muscle ""tone,"" also known as continuous postural tension. Your eyes are naturally rolled up, and it's just the tone of the oculomotor muscles that keeps them down. Yes, this happens even while sleeping. (Same for your eyelids -- fully relaxed = 90% closed, not 100% closed. That's why syncope caused by drugs has the distinct half-lidded look rather than other forms of fainting, which reflexively tighten the eyelid muscles to keep them shut.)

Fainting and experiencing extreme pleasure activates similar pathways, as the body starts to ignore or shut down certain parts of the body to focus on  pleasurable sensation. Your eye muscles lose tension (since you don't need your eyes to orgasm), so your eye naturally rolls back.

Watch someone blink in slow motion when they're not focusing intensely on something. You'll notice their eyes roll back slightly as the oculumotor muscles relax during the blink. (Intense focusing can overcome this reflex.)

Sidenote: parasympathetic innervation is involved with sexual intercourse (it's nicknamed ""feed and breed,"" after all) but it doesn't cause the eye roll reflex since it doesn't innervate the oculomotor muscles. The parasympathetic response is in full force on the initiation of coitus anyway...

Babies start their language with simple motions of their mouths, the simpler the better. Their first words are going to be the easiest to shape... and ""M"" and ""A"" require no tongue movement and are by far the easiest to shape. Close your mouth and breathe through your throat in a way that makes sound: ""M"". Open it and do the same ""A"".

(edit/added a bit later for clarity: and it's clear too, unlike cooing or babbling or making nonsense sounds. ""mama"" is a very clear conscious construct due to its repetition)

""D"" and ""P"" and ""B"" take a little extra timing or tongue movement to say right and get that hard stop in the case of the P or the B.

So MA-MA is recognizable even when slurred, and very easy for baby to make and then latch onto as a first ""word"", and then to understand that it refers to the parent who is around more than the other one (who is out hunting mammoths or buying cigarettes or whatever).

But DA-DA requires tongue manipulation, BA-BA and PAPA requires some timing to say correctly. So the ""second most familiar parent"" gets those when the baby learns to say them too.)",eli5

From an outsider's perspective, this is unexpected, because the brick is so small, so it's expected to not do any significant damage. The videos though, prove wrong, and the washing machines just tear themselves apart. What's the physics behind it and why does it happen?

Video for reference: _URL_0_","Because the spinning cylinder has a huge amount of kinetic energy, and adding a brick causes the load to be unbalanced.  That unbalancing means a large portion of the rotational energy converts into linear energy (similar to how vibration works in sex toys or video game controllers except with vastly more energy in play).  

The machine destroys itself, because it's not designed to damp that much linear energy, because engineers design the machine to have a reasonable safety margin over likely loads (ie wet clothes reasonably well distributed throughout the washtub).  The machine could be designed to absorb that much energy, but it would make washing machines more expensive, heavier, and not be any more useful at their main task (washing clothes).",eli5

Oil is sold with a delivery date, it can be between 90 and god knows how many days, so in the best case you´re paying a gas price based on the oil price from 3 months ago. 

Now the actual price of oil only constitues to around 30% of the price of gasoline, you have to take in to consideration, 

- Local Taxes
- State Taxes
- Federal Taxes
- Refining cost
- Gas company (Exxon, Texaco, Shell...) profit margin
- Actual gas station profit margin (the gas station isnt owned by Exxon, Texaco, Shell or whoever, Its a franchise)

So even if the cost of a gallon of gasoline was around 25 cents, between taxes and profit margins you would still end up paying atleast 80 cents, 

Basing gasoline price on the price of the barrel of oil (barrel is a mesurment unit, its not a physical barrel for those idiots saying that the barrel itself is now more expensive then the oil inside of it) is like basing the price of a loaf of bread on the price of wheat the same day you bought the loaf.

5yxlyx,"Can the language I speak affect how I think? In some languages adjectives are before nouns, in others, after -- does this, or other differences, change how we think or perceive things? ","There's a lot of debate about this, and the answer is unclear. /u/SleeplessinRedditle quoted a study by Chen, who is an economist and not a linguist, but he makes several very basic errors: for example, he claims English has a ""strong"" future tense and German has a ""weak"" future tense, but in fact both languages express the future in almost exactly the same ways (he claims that English always requires a future marker except in very specific cases which he then sets aside, but this is completely false). His hypothesis also fails to explain why savings rates in different countries with the same languages vary so much: Ireland is near the top of the chart in the linked article, Australia near the middle, and the US and the UK right at the bottom.

The basic idea that language can affect how you think is known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (although neither Sapir nor Whorf actually formulated it), and has been floated around and discussed since 1929: it's more correctly called ""linguistic relativity"". It comes in two basic versions: linguistic determinism says that the language you speak necessarily restricts the range of possible thoughts you can have and so dictates how you perceive things; linguistic influence says that the language you speak can have some effect on how you think and perceive in some ways, but doesn't dictate everything.

Chen appears to lean towards determinism; if you've seen *Arrival*, the scriptwriters basically took the determinist model of Sapir-Whorf and ran with it. Obviously, learning a new language can't literally rewire your brain to the extent that you can see all of time -- it makes a great movie, but scientifically it's bunk -- but the consensus among linguists at the moment is that there is no evidence at all to support the idea of linguistic determinism.

Basically, linguistic determinism says that before you can think, you must have language. People who speak languages that use the same word for ""blue"" and ""green"" can't tell the difference between those two colours.

However, research suggests the opposite: that we are all born able to think, and then we learn a language that enables us to express those thoughts. Somebody who speaks a language that makes no distinction between ""green"" and ""blue"" can still tell the difference between them: they just use the same label for them.

Anecdotally, this chimes in with my experience. Russian has different words for what we call different shades of blue: I can still see the difference between them, but I take longer than a native speaker of Russian to decide which word goes with which shade.

[This study](_URL_0_) suggests that the language does make a bit of a difference -- just not a big one.

Having lived in Germany now for nearly 25 years, I can say that learning the language hasn't made me better at saving money, or changed my perception in any meaningful way. There are some things I can express better in German than in English and vice versa: I don't *think* differently, but I am able to express a slightly different range of thoughts.",eli5

In the same regard, not having anything to stop or at least reduce the amount that's being lost by the meat (regardless if it's still raw or currently being cooked) is what's happening when you remove the bone from the meat. That, and you may have had to make a couple more cuts or push down on the meat (making it lose liquids like when you press down on a wet sponge) in the process of removing the bone.

Two vectors at 90 degrees from one another will have a dot product of zero since they do not lie on each other at all, while other vectors are less so.

More quantitatively, given two vectors A and B, the dot product is also a cheap way of calculating |A||B|cos(x) where x is the angle between the two vectors. Essentially calculating the value of cosine without actually calculating cosine turns out to be very useful in other aspects.

It comes up in physics often because quantities tend to be conserved in the 3 dimensions, that is say for instance momentum is conserved along the x, y, and z directions. Having to calculate these components often involves the use of trigonometric functions, at which point the dot and cross products can help due to their inherent nature.",eli5

I was high and speaking to a licensed doctor who was also high at the time about what causes darker skin color in humans and we agreed that it was due in large part to the more intense concentration of ultraviolet radiation along the equator. I am confused about how radiation along that specific region of the planet is much more concentrated as opposed to the rest of it. It implies that UV radiation is less intense at the north and south poles and the radiation gets stronger closer to the equator. Someone please explain this to me. Does the magnetic field of the earth have anything to do with the path uv rays take?,"The earth is round. The equator more directly faces the sun.

4ka2dl,Why do we swing our arms when we walk if it doesn't make a difference whether we do it or not?,"Recently, scientists have completed more advanced research on the issue and discovered that swinging your arms while walking definitely does have a purpose. Like many other bodily functions, it occurs because it's the most natural and efficient way to walk. In other words, swinging your arms while you walk helps to reduce the total amount of energy it takes to walk.

Don't believe it's natural? Try walking without moving your arms. Better yet, try walking while swinging your left arm when you step with your left foot and vice versa. Both of these practices are unlike the natural method of arm swinging while walking, which is for your left arm to swing forward as you step forward with your right foot.

Scientists used those two alternative methods to test whether the natural method of arm swinging while walking was the most efficient. To their surprise, they discovered that people who hold their arms still while walking use 12% more energy than people who swing their arms normally.

Even more surprising was what they found when they had people walk with their arms in sync with their legs (left arm swing forward when stepping forward with the left leg). Those people used 26% more energy compared to normal walking.

Researchers found that normal arm swinging actually doesn't use much energy from the arm muscles. Simply walking causes the body to sway in a way that makes the arms move naturally, like a pendulum.

So when you walk, your arms begin to swing naturally without much effort from your arm muscles. The natural movement of your arms also helps to offset a part of the force caused by your legs hitting the ground, keeping your torso and hips from wobbling and twisting too much. This results in your legs using less energy!

However, it's reasonable to expect that Disney will lay off some people as a result of the merger.  Disney and the portions of Fox that they're buying have a lot of people that do the same thing, and the combined company is likely to not need all of them.  For example, if Disney has 100 film editors and Fox has 70 film editors (or riggers, or production assistants, or lots of other jobs), but the combined company only needs 150 film editors, then the company will look to lay off 20 of them.",eli5
1j0qdc,Why do I usually wake up super tired and feeling like crap but after several minutes I'll be energetic during most of the day (Without coffee). ,"Ignoring insufficient sleep, it's probably because your are waking up with an alarm as opposed to naturally.  Sleep has several stages from light sleep to deep sleep.  If you wake up naturally it will more likely be during the light stages of sleep where you are almost awake.  If you wake up from an alarm (and haven't trained in polyphasic sleep) it may be from a deeper stage which will require a few minutes for your body to wake up.  Remember that humans evolved on the plains of Africa before we had fire never mind electronic lighting.  We used to rise and sleep with the Sun and actually were awake for a few hours around 1am due to a long night and not needing that much sleep.

To combat this you can try to time your sleep better (a quick rule of thumb is to sleep in increments of 90min but you'll need to experiment to see what works best for you).  You can also check out the [polyphasic sleep society pages](_URL_0_) for how to reduce overall sleep while [theoretically] maintaining enough REM and deep wave (Delta) sleep to not be sleep deprived.  Finally consider investing in some sort of bluelight therapy (bluelight causes your body to become stimulated) as there are some pretty swell sunrise alarms and at the very least it will conquer your sleepiness faster.",eli5
bfa5ja,- Why do some languages have male and female words? Eg German.,"An important thing to take note of is not to put too much weight in to the words ""Masculine"", ""Feminine"", and ""Neuter"". these conventions are less trying to apply gender to objects and more trying to group similar words together in to word classes. it would be no different if we'd call these words ""Black, White, Gray"" words, or ""class-1, class-2, class-3"" nouns. This is the difference between natural gender and grammatical gender. Natural gender is what gender you are, grammatical gender is the class the word describing you falls in to. 

Words that are in the same class share certain properties. for instance masculine words in icelandic tend to have the definite artice ""-inn"", often take on the suffix ""arnir"" when in plural, and all use the masculine declinitions of adjectives (i.e all blue masculine objects are ""blár"", whereas feminine words are ""blá"", and neuter ""blátt"").  knowing the gender of a word helps you knowing how to use that word, and what other words in the language it behaves like. 

it also is suspected to aid with sentence processing. If you mishear or miss a part of what someone is saying to you the other words in the sentence can help you deduce what you just missed, and gender helps narrow down the possibilities. 

Finally it helps with language clarity and usage a bit. In english you always use ""it"" for things without a natural gender (unless you personify things like your boat). So, when talking about a mug on a table you say ""It was placed on it"". While this is easy to deduce from context it isn't instantly clear if the mug is on the table or the table on the mug. However in icelandic you would say ""Hann er á því"" (He is on it). The mug is masculine, and the table is neuter. Even if you're unsure of how tables work you instantly know which object is being referred to, because the table can't be a ""he"" and the mug can't be an ""it"".",eli5

3p7cvz,Why do the Japanese exchange 'r' and 'l' sounds so often and sometimes even in their own language? ,"They don't. The Japanese language does not have an L sound, and their R sounds very similar to a mix between the two, with a little bit of D thrown in. As a result, it can be very hard for ears that aren't accustomed to this sound to tell that is actually an R and not an L. In words borrowed from other languages that have an L in them, as well as names, they replace the L with an R.

An example of this is the anime Death Note. The main character is named Light. In Japan, they spell it Ratio (this is a romanization, as I can't type the Japanese characters) and pronounce it as such, though the O is very subtle. It almost sounds like they are just saying Light.

In addition, some people have a little more L sound in their Rs, which makes it even more confusing for foreign ears.

Tl;Dr: there is no L sound in Japanese, just an R that sounds like L sometimes.",eli5

1f1k8j,How come you can give a person any number and they can iterate forwards or backwards on demand but with the alphabet most seem to only Have a few fixed points to start from and can't as easily go backwards ,"Because the order of the letters are completely arbitrary. And there are many more letters than there are digits.

Numbers are systematic. You *learn* to count by memorizing only 10 different digits, then use a simple system to make more numbers. Counting backwards is just removing 1 over and over again.

For the alphabet you need to memorize each of the letters, and their order. To recite the alphabet backwards you'd need to learn that order just like you once learned it the ""right"" way.

I think many people, like me for instance, learned the alphabet by learning it as a song (twinkle twinkle?), because melodies are easy to remember for some reason (that's how our brains are wired). But singing a song backwards or starting in a random place in the middle of it isn't as easy.",eli5

1ou2sx,"Why do humans have different blood types? and what is the chance that new blood types can emerge.


edit: Thanks guys for the answers. That was really great.","Blood types are way more complicated than most people realize.

Blood types are basically a way to describe what proteins are present on the surface of your red blood cells. Somebody with type A blood cells has a type A protein on their RBCs (Red Blood Cells), a person with type B blood has protein B on their RBCs, and a person with type AB has both and a person with type O blood has neither.

But the ABO system is not the only blood type. There are also the Rh proteins (Which are usually designated with either positive or negative after your ABO typing), and the Rh typing actually describes the activity of 50 different proteins that are considered as a whole in determining if you are Rh+ or Rh-.

The H/h system determines your ability to express your ABO type. If you lack the H antigen you are designated as blood type Bombay, and are neither A/B/AB/O. Extremely rare.

Se/se typing determines whether your blood proteins are found only on the surface of your RBCs, or also body fluids such as saliva. It also acts (when found with H) to convert another blood group, Lewis, from Lewis-type-A to Lewis-Type-B, determining which is adsorbed onto the RBC surface....

And so on and so on. There are over 30 different blood groups (covering hundreds of different proteins) in addition to ABO, although not all of them are as critical in transfusion. Some groups will actually change over time, some are altered by pregnancy, others by exposure to transfused blood, and this isn't even considering the antibody systems directed against foreign blood types.

So, humans have different blood groups because blood groups are complex emergent systems influenced by the interaction of hundreds of protein systems in our blood and endothelial cells. Certainly, new blood groups are possible, as mutation could alter any of these proteins in any number of ways.

My Q is, why did they built it there in the first place? Doesn't it make more sense to built a center, launch bay and all that jazz in a place that is less likely to have weather that can alter, say, the launch of a rocket? Maybe the Arizona desert or some place like that?","It's placed there because:

* Rockets ideally need to travel east when launching - the spin of the Earth assists with the launch rather than trying to fight it.

* Because they are going east, launches that go bad will then be dumping into the ocean rather than over populated areas. Early rocket launches were in fact tested in New Mexico, but they were much shorter range. When we began space rocketry in earnest we wanted things to not explode over our own cities.

* Orbital mechanics favor launching closer to the equator for the most part - again due to using the rotation of the Earth in your favor.

15rik5,Why do Ford and Chevrolet have subsidary companies (Lincoln and GMC) that produce pretty much the same vehicles? ,"In the early days of the automotive industry, there were a great deal of competing manufacturers.  Over time, some merged, some were bought out, and some bankrupted, until the Big 3 (Ford, Chrysler, GM) were all that were left.  Lincoln was originally an independent marque (bought out in 1922), as was Dodge (1928)

At the same time, the manufacturers were using a different-brand strategy to segregate the market.  The Ford Motor Company (FMC, to differentiate the company from the marque) created Mercury to have a line of mid-level cars between their Ford brand and Lincoln.  This allowed FMC to tap into a market which wanted a more upscale car but couldn't afford top of the line.  Chrysler did the same thing with their Plymouth brand.

General Motors started out as a holding company for car brands, first with Buick and Durant; Oldsmobile, Cadillac. Rapid (forerunner of the GM truck line) and Oakland (later Pontiac) were all independent automakers at one point.  

Car buyers didn't want the most basic, cheapest model of car.  GM was the first to realize the market had room for variety.  The differentiation of GM brands began in the early 1900s and was well underway by 1920; the FMC didn't buy Lincoln until 1922.

From Wikipedia: ""At one time each of GM's automotive divisions in the United States was targeted to a specific market segment, and, despite some shared components, each distinguished itself from its stablemates with unique styling and technology. The shared components and common corporate management created substantial economies of scale, while the distinctions between the divisions created (in the words of GM President Sloan) a 'ladder of success.'""

In short, sharing parts made it economical to keep a stable of several marques, each different enough to be aimed at a different segment of the market.

PS: Chevrolet is a GM subsidiary; General Motors is the name of the company.",eli5

As you go up in trophic levels energy is decreased by 90%(Or so my textbook tells me), so what is the use of being a carnivore if you get so much less energy?","Let's say there is a small plot of grass and a lot of cows.  This situation works fine as long as the population of cows stays low.  If the number of cows grows too large however, eventually they will over eat and they will starve to death.  It becomes a race to which one can eat the most.

However if one cow was born that really enjoyed eating meat, that cow now has a distinct evolutionary advantage.  While all the other cows are eating itself out of house and home, this new cow eats the things that are eating the old primary food source.

This evolution happens to work really well in an atmosphere because the predator-prey relationship happens to work in the same way as the original cow-grass relationship.

So now you have multiple tiers of predators growing in which everything has a natural predator.

It sort of just stops at us because we don't have any natural predators anymore to keep our numbers in check.  Much like the cows eating grass our numbers grow wildly out of control with no sight of stopping.",eli5

1ja2ld,Why does my dream slip away as I try to recall the details upon waking up in the morning? (sorry if this is a repost) I've had some really weird and emotionally moving dreams over the years.  Some have sparked creative ideas or taken me to mystical places that I want to better immerse myself in; problem is that I can't seem to focus on the details or I lose the whole thing...,"This is a bit of a repost, it's a common question that [has](_URL_2_) been [answered](_URL_1_) a [few](_URL_0_) times. But here is how I understand it for a quick idea.

Your brain has a few different kind of memories that you could think of, one is the active working memory, your immediate attention, like a math problem you're solving right now. This is fluid, and it's usually your pathway to remembering your dreams, you have a small section of time after you wake up when you can keep your attention on what you were just dreaming about and you'll actually be able to have pretty good success recalling it if you make a habit of laying in bed before you start your day and just thinking about what you dreamt of the previous night. The real important idea though is that once you start shifting your attention to other things, getting ready, getting dressed, making breakfast, you're losing most of your pathway to remembering that dream.

The second kind of memory is a medium-length memory, this is where the events of your day sit. If you've seen 50 first dates, this is the highest level of memory that was available to Drew Barrymore's character (I know it's a movie, but this situation does exist in real life) When you go to sleep at night, this part of your memory is transferred to your long term memory, the one that will let you remember your last week, your childhood, and all your other day to day memories when you wake up. The reason that it's hard to remember your dreams is because this second, medium-length memory is being actively emptied by your brain as you sleep.",eli5

Also sorry for random foods,I am hungry.","That's a really interesting question. I can tell you are thinking. Sadly your French fry simply won't get hot again and your cheese will never just get cool.  

Both of them work actually work in the same way.  It's not that some things get cool and others get hot.  Both of them get closer to room temperature. 

Whenever there are two things touching (like a French fry and air) heat moves from the hotter one to the colder one.  In the case of a hot French fry in room temperature air, the french-fry is the hot one so it loses heat and the air gets the heat. The air gets a little warmer by the french-fry.  For the cool cheese and room temperature air the air counts as the warmer one so heat moves from the air to the cheese.  The cheese gets warmer and the air gets a little cooler.

6ifbo9,why can we talk in our head and be able to hear and understand it? ,"We really don't know, and some people can not. Check out [Aphantasia](_URL_0_), which generally concerns the inability to ""visualize"" things, but extends, in some cases, to having no ""inner monologue"".

ASIDE: I didn't realize I couldn't do the mind picture thing until the one time, as an adult when I suddenly could for a few seconds. For whatever reason I suddenly could see a camshaft in my mind... and I'm not even a gear head. Now, of late I've discovered that CBD oil in a fairly large dose will let me turn on this feature of my brain somewhat.

There is also the inextricable question of ""what is consciousness"", which strongly seems to include this inner voice, but according to that whole aphantasia thing doesn't require the voice completely...

When I read the literature as a lay person (and something of a librarian, and an accomplished computer scientist) it seems to me that the whole mechanism of consciousness and inner monologue is something of an error correction protocol.

We seem to have a vested interest in being able to monitor our own thoughts. The primary role feels like a ""bullshit detector"", where we can try ideas to see if they fit, or if they are worth admitting despite their ill-fit, with our ""story of the universe"".

Basically we need to be able to ""try on"" what we just heard or thought, and so what we are about to say.

In terms of pure mechanism, most of the brain is an electrical/neurological dead end. All the signaling enters and leaves through the brain stem or other ""primitive"" structures, but all of our ""higher thinking"" happens in the newer structures that don't directly touch the outside world.

So it makes sense that ""the outputs are tied back to the inputs"" in a feedback loop.

We hear sounds. Those sounds go through a decoder to convert them into information. The information goes pretty much everywhere in the ""neocortex"" systems of your brain. Those cortex operations formulate a response. As that response heads back it gets looped through the decoder. We get a chance to decide if that output is worth it. (Should I _really_ say that or is it just going to lead to violence or embarrassment?) If it gets a pass then that's what we say (or do) in response.

So people who _couldn't_ ""Try on their words before speaking"" might be a lot more likely to say something that would get them in trouble. It also lets us choose between phrasing; ""I is happy"" and ""I am happy""; to decide which one makes us sound less stupid or whatever.

Once you understand that you experience yourself at sort of the mid-level of abstraction, that you ""hear words"" _despite_ the input just being a bunch of individual sound waves, then the model makes more sense.

Try repeating a word, any word - I recommend ""door"" - aloud, again and again. You'll soon find yourself asking yourself if its a real word. The sound will literally begin to lose its meaning. We think this happens because when its repeated for no reason the parts of the brain that are so conceptual that we don't feel them running concludes that the repetition of the word is ""just a sound"" instead of being a meaningful act of speech.

So a lot of inclusive and frankly subjective thought tell us that the part of us we think of as being us is just a slab of middleware. It's the system that monitors the flow from the physical to the conceptual and back. And the system works because it can block the noise and the ""bad ideas"" from making it all the way through by saying ""nah, that can't be right"".

But since it's the same singular system it all ""sounds the same"" whether the signal is coming from the outside or the inside. But not exactly the same. Most people assign their own voice to their inner monologue. They can tell someone else's words from their own.

And, of course, when that identity operation starts to fall apart, people start ""hearing other voices in their head"" instead of just their own.

This means the system is important but a little bit fragile.

And none of this is ""fixed and solid scientific doctrine"" as there is no identified and absolutely distinct part of the brain where this all happens. There's no one spot we could laser out to ""pull the plug"" to turn off this feature. So it is extremely difficult to quantify.",eli5

They still have their forward velocity vector, however, from perspective of the passengers, the plane feels like the plane is dropping straight down.

Generally what is happening when this feeling happens is that the plane is experiencing a sudden downdraft, or a swirling vortex of air. A wing generates more lift the greater the angle is to the incoming air (angle of attack). The greater the angle of attack, the greater the lift. A plane needs to generate enough lift force to equal weight, otherwise it will begin to fall. When a plane is cruising, Lift = Weight. When the wing experiences a downward column of air, the angle of attack drops, and so does the lift. Weight  >  Lift, so the plane free-falls.",eli5

2f2odp,How come contact lenses don't iritate your eyes but if you stick anything else in your eye it stings? Having contact lenses in your eyes does not irritate your eye (unless in for a long time). But if anything else touches your eye it will immediately water and go blood shot.,"Part of it is because the contact lenses are inserted with saline, as mentioned by /u/my-little-wonton and /u/Schnutzel -- drying out will cause it to become uncomfortable. But there are two other factors that I can think of.

The first is that the contact lens is specifically made to fit over your eye. It'll be as close a match as possible to something that fits smoothly. Something else that goes in there is almost certainly *not* going to fit smoothly. So it's sort of like the difference in comfort between a sock, and a stone within that sock -- especially as the presence of the contact lens will make any foreign object much more uncomfortable than it would have been without the lens (at least, that was my experience when I wore contacts.)

The other factor is that your eye is gradually accustomed to the contact lens. I don't know if you wear lenses, or are just asking out of curiosity, but when a person is given contact lenses for the first time, they are typically instructed to start out wearing them only for an hour at a time, and to gradually increase the period. They are irritating to wear at first; I remember my eyes burning terribly the first time I wore contact lenses. But eventually the eye gets used to the presence of the lens.",eli5

*Depth of field* is basically the area of your vision that is in focus. The human eye automatically adjusts the our DoF when we focus on something, much like a point-and-shoot digital camera. Hold up your hand about 10cm in front of your face and look at it. Notice how everything in the background is blurry and out of focus? Now hold your hand out as far as you can and look at it, -the background should be a little fuzzy but not to the same extent as it was before. Now as you read this sentence, hold your hand up in front of your face but continue looking at these words, -your hand will be out of focus.

Try to visualize your sight as a straight line from your eye to a point 1 kilometre away, kind of like [this](_URL_0_). Now when you're looking at things close to your face, your depth of field will be very 'shallow', or thin. The only area that will be in focus is from about 5cm away from your nose to 10cm away from your nose, -a 5cm wide DoF. As the object you are focusing on moves further away from your face, the width or the DoF surrounding it will grow gradually wider. The DoF surrounding your hands at arms length will stretch to about 10cm in front of and behind of your hands. When you're focusing on a chair five metres away, the DoF will stretch from 50cm in front of the object to 50cm behind, and so on. The depth of field gets bigger and bigger as we look at things that are further away, so when we look out at a mountain range, pretty much everything from 30 metres to infinity is in focus.

Now look at the 'tilt-shift' photos you've linked once more, and take note of what the focus, or DoF is like. Really shallow, right? *Just as we were holding it in front of our noses*! Basically, these 'miniature fakes', as they are sometimes called, work by presenting a scene that would normally be completely clear and sharp to the human eye with only a thin slice of focus. Because of how we are used to viewing the world, the brain says 'well obviously that's not a large scene, if it were it would be in focus', and draws the conclusion that it must be very miniature and diorama-sized. I guess you could say that it's a kind of illusion.

The way this shallow depth of field is achieved is by physically tilting the lens so that it's at an angle to the camera, which changes the shape of the depth of field and introduces some other concepts like the *plane of focus* and the *Scheimpflug principle*. It's pretty complex, and to be honest, I don't fully understand it. You can't do it with normal camera lenses though, you need ones that can bend themselves. Realistically though, 95% percent of the ones you see online have probably been artificially created in photoshop, as tilt-shift lenses are very expensive and the effect is hard to achieve, whereas it is relatively easy to fake. Here's some 
[before](_URL_2_) and [after](_URL_1_) shots of someone faking the effect on a computer. It's also important to note that no shift (vertical bending of the lens) is involved at all, only tilt (horizontal bend). Thus the name of the style is largely irrelevant and misinforming, I kind of resent that...

In retrospect this was a pretty big wall of text, tell me if any parts seem convoluted or not understandable. Anyway **I will photoshop a miniature version of a landscape picture, if someone cares enough to post one** (no obscenely low resolutions please).",eli5

1t5xzi,Why does everyone care about carbon footprints? Aren't there gases that are much worse then carbon dioxide we should worry about? It seems like when talking about the environment everyone is always concerned about being carbon neutral and such. Why Carbon?,"Yes, there are other things people should be aware of, not just gases either.

CO2 has been identified as a ""greenhouse gas,""  and it's a product of combustion, which is the primary way most people get their transportation and electrical energy from.  People believe that increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will result in increased atmosphere temperatures.  The increase in temperature may damage vulnerable organism and ecosystems.  

Also that the increased CO2 in the atmosphere (which is heavier than most of the rest of the gases in the air, like O2, N2 and H2O) will fall and mix into the bodies of water, like oceans or lakes, and turn them a bit more acidic, as CO2 is a ""weak acid"" when dissolved in water, also disturbing some ecosystems.

Personally, I think far too much attention is given to CO2, and many other environmental concerns are being ignored and neglected.  Other gases, like O3 or NOx, salts and dissolved solids like Phosphates and nitrates, and many heavy metals have more immediate and often more devastating effects of the environment.",eli5

I was sitting in the library at my university when I noticed that something in my pocket felt really hot. I took out my phone, my wallet, a walmart reciept, and there were only three things left in my pocket which were really hot. I went to the public bathroom and made myself a toilet paper hot pad and pulled the remaining contents of my pocket out. There was a 1981 quarter, a 2013 nickel, and a rechargeable battery. The positive end of the battery had been touching the two coins which were stacked on top of each other at the bottom of my pocket. The positive part of the battery had liquid bubbles forming and popping out of the end of it and the two coins have black ""scorch mark"" looking spots on them. The inside of my pocket was scorched black and the walmart receipt that was in my pocket also turned black on the part that was touching the quarters. The two coins together are not even long enough side by side to touch both sides of the battery and they were only on the positive side when I removed them. How did the battery + coins get so hot when only the positive side of the battery was touching them? ","You completed a circuit in your pocket, allowing electric current to flow. The coins have some resistance, so the current passing through them dissipates some power across the coins. That power dissipation is observed as heat. Same thing happens if you connect the two terminals of a battery with a wire. 

With math, P=V^2 /R. The voltage of your battery is probably 3.3V, so it's fixed. When resistance is very low, the power dissipation goes up. Things like nickel and copper have pretty low resistances, so the coins dissipated lots of power.",eli5

225lz3,"Why do some black people put on an ""accent?"" Some things to clear up first:

- I promise I'm not being racist, it's a serious question.

- This is not a stereotype; rather, it is simply an observation.

- I have explicitly stated that this only occurs in certain people and certain situations, and does not reflect the entirety of the black race.

- I've used the search bar but haven't found any threads asking this question, so I'm sorry if this happens to be a duplicate :(

I've noticed lately that many black people in the U.S. use a kind of ""accent"" or ""dialect,"" which includes ~~purposefully~~ misusing standard grammar (especially subject-verb agreements or even using verbs at all) and a lower and more sing-songy tone of voice.

I've also noticed that this is more widely used around uneducated blacks than those who are ""educated"" so to say (sorry, I couldn't find a better term); for example, someone like a gang member is more likely to use this ""accent"" than someone who's a businessman. I've also noticed that it is much more prevalent for teenagers/young adults than anyone else, and this ""accent"" is heavily portrayed throughout media.

Also, I've noticed this around my friends who are black as well – they'll speak perfectly normally most of the time, but they'll occasionally switch to this ""accent"" when they're talking with other black people.

Any idea what this is and why this happens?","It's called [African American Vernacular English](_URL_0_). It's not really ""putting on"" an accent - it's their accent, just like anyone else's. They grew up hearing it, so it's what they use.

As for who uses it and when, it's the same as any non-standard accent of English, and it gets to issues of identity. If you're someone who wants to identify with mainstream, middle-class or upper-class America, chances are good you'll speak with a standard American accent. If you want to identify with a peer group that is outside that mainstream, you'll use your local accent. Some people are able to switch between those accents in different contexts (I know when I go back to visit my hometown, within a few days my accent comes back much stronger than it normally is). On the other hand, some people never get much exposure to Standard American English, and can't speak it.

 > which includes purposefully misusing grammar (especially subject-verb agreements or even using verbs at all)

It's worth addressing this. They're not purposefully misusing grammar, it's just that AAVE has a different grammar than Standard American English. It has consistent rules, though, so they're not randomly making ""mistakes""; again, it's just a different set of rules.",eli5

4s4uhu,"Why do we have fever dreams when we are sick, and what about a fever causes them to happen? ","/u/whatthefat answered this pretty well [here](_URL_0_) on /r/askscience a few years ago. 

 >  It's a great question that's surprisingly hard to answer! Here's my best shot. Fever can be induced by chemicals called pyrogens . Many cytokines  (immune-signalling molecules) are pyrogens. When you get an infection, your body releases more cytokines.
There are well established connections between cytokines and sleep . Specifically, a higher concentration of some cytokines induces sleepiness, which is why you get sleepy when you have an infection. Altered sleep during infection is thought to be part of the acute-phase response to help recovery. Interestingly, when you get insufficient sleep, your immune system function is impaired -- people who habitually sleep less than 7 h per night are ~3 times more likely to contract the common cold following exposure via nasal drops than those who habitually sleep more than 8 h per night .
You might then surmise that since our most vivid dreams occur dreaming REM sleep (note that it is possible to have dreams in NREM sleep too, they just tend to be more mundane) we must get more REM sleep when we are sick and have a fever. Surprisingly, however, increased cytokine concentrations  and fever  result in less REM sleep! This may be partly due to the fact that during REM sleep, shivering is not possible due to muscle atonia, making it more difficult to efficiently thermoregulate.
So what's going on? Well, sleep is often much more fragmented when we have a fever. Body temperature generally decreases during NREM sleep. It has been proposed that frequent awakenings to raise temperature may be a mechanism to prevent undue heat loss.
A plausible (but by no means verified) answer to your question is that people simply remember more dreams due to sleep fragmentation associated with some fevers. People dream every night and will report dreaming about 90% of the time if awoken from REM sleep. These dreams are typically vivid and bizarre in character. However, we don't usually remember most of these dreams because short-term memory does not function normally during sleep. You only tend to remember a dream well if you are awake for some time after it.

It's not an easy read, but it's pretty damn good. I hope it helps!

1evf0o,"Why do cars still have pedals It seems that by now we should be able to control these things with our hands. I realize that there are cars you don't need feet to operate, but why haven't these been mass produced for the general populace? I feel like I would feel safer with control of my vehicle in my hands rather than my feet. ","I confess I don't really get why you think it should be different. There are several things you have to do with a car at any moment:

- Steer
- Shift gears or modes
- Signal
- Interact with the console
- Accelerate
- Brake
- Clutch (optional of course)

While all this goes on, you may also want a free hand to, ie, take a drink from your cup of coffee, roll down the window, adjust the visor, adjust the seat, etc...

Accelerating, coasting, and braking all require constant interaction with the car (largely for safety reasons). In other words, you can't ""stop braking"" to do something else, or take your foot off the gas while you roll the window down real quick. You have to apply the brake continuously until you're stopped. You have to apply the throttle continuously so you aren't slowing unexpectedly.

That's an awful lot of stuff to put on just two hands. Would you really want to hold the accelerator with your thumb while you drive, or, at the drive through, hold the brake with one hand while you take your food and pay? Perhaps you are envisioning some kind of ""stop"" button that would do the braking for you, or an always-on cruise control. But those would almost certainly be a safety hazard. Experienced drivers are very adept at interacting quickly, effectively, and subconsciously with the car itself. Do you ever press your foot to the floor when riding in the passenger seat? When you are in traffic, you need to be constantly adjusting the throttle and brake to maintain safe distances, avoid obstacles, etc...

1md63c,Why did new world monkeys not evolve like old world monkeys when they lived in similar environments? i.e. rain forrests Question I asked my professor who has his phd in anthro and couldn't give me an answer. ,"Evolution occurs when random mutations spread out amongst a population. Over time, environmental changes make some of these mutations slightly more beneficial and others slightly less beneficial. The ones most suited to the environment survive and the population as a whole changes, eventually resulting in different species. 

The key word here is RANDOM. The original common-ancestor populations had similar genetics, but then over millions of years of separation, random changes are going to enter the populations and change them, even if the environment stays absolutely constant.

For example, if you cut a genetically identical colony of bacteria in half and grow each half under absolutely identical conditions for thousands of generations, you'll eventually end up with lots of bacteria which are genetically different, simply though normal random genetic variance.

Now add in the effects of changing environment. Sticking with our two pots of bacteria, let's treat them both exactly the same, but we're going to raise and drop the temperature a little every day. Some bacteria will be unable to cope with the changes and will die. Some will cope, some will actually thrive. We'll end up with two populations of bacteria which are adapted to cope with fluctuating temperature. 

**BUT, the genetic changes that make these adaptations are not necessarily the SAME changes.**

All an organism has to do is survive. It doesn't matter what solution it comes up with, as long as that solution works. There's nothing to say that the solution has to be the same for both populations. Look at plants in a desert. Some store water for dry times, others develop tough barks and incredibly long roots to minimise water loss and try to find underground reserves. They've both found different solutions to the same problem. 

Now consider that although the new world and old world environments are similar, they are NOT the same. Tiny things such as a particularly bad winter or dry summer can have huge effects on the populations that survived that year, and therefore the genetic mix that went on. In entirely separate populations, the same or similar problems would have have been solved from scratch, and therefore different outcomes arrive. 

Yes, sometimes evolution throws up identical solutions (fingerprints in primates, for example), but that doesn't prove that there is only one solution to needing grip in the fingers, only that both populations managed somehow to arrive at the same solution in for that particular problem. For every similar genetic twist, it's just as likely there'll be a different one.",eli5

337rwd,"- Why does my mouth taste all gross and icky when I wake up after 6-8 hours, even if I brush before bed, but it doesn't feel that gross if I'm awake without brushing for much longer? ","Dentist here...

It's because your mouth IS gross after 6-8 hours of sleeping.  When you are awake, your saliva production is increased, your tongue, lips, and cheeks push that saliva around in your mouth, and it all gets swallowed.  That saliva washes away food, bacteria, fungi, viruses, dust, hair, bugs, whatever down into your stomach where it is digested.  Talking, chewing, licking your teeth all help the process along.

At night, all of that stops.  You produce very little saliva (yes, you may drool a little, but it is a very small amount over those 6-8 hours compared to day time saliva production).  Your tongue is very still, your lips and cheeks also stop moving for very long periods of time.  Swallowing also is reduced, and many people sleep with their mouths open, which allows for ample accumulation of dust (dust is very gross), mites, pollen, hair, bacteria, yeast, etc to collect in your warm, moist incubator-like mouth.  

After several hours, your saliva in your mouth begins to evaporate, leaving a thick, sticky film laden with gross and icky stuff.  That bacteria that naturally occurs in your mouth and the air around you has had countless numbers of reproductive cycles, and now your mouth is one giant petri dish.

3guofv,"How are the words in phonetic alphabets (such as the NATO phonetic alphabet) chosen and why have they changed over the years? How were the words chosen? Why have they changed in the past?

The point of the phonetic alphabet is to be able to easily distinguish the first letter of the the word from the first letter of other words.

If you had it be Apple, Bog, Cat, Dog, Era, Flame, George, Happy, India, Jericho, Kilo, Little, Map, Newton, Ontario, Prairie, Quiet, Roger, Sample, Tornado, Ultra, Victor, Water, Xylophone, York, Zebra then there are going to be some confusion.

Obviously things like ""Bog"" and ""Dog"" or ""Cat"" and ""Mat"" can be easily confused especially when you are doing other stuff. Even things like ""Apple"" and ""Sample"" can be confused with enough distractions and/or a poor radio signal.

And then there are words like ""George"" and ""Xylophone"" where saying the word doesn't give a precise first letter. Some people spell ""George"" as ""Jorge"" and many don't know how to spell xylophone. 

So they keep it simple and make sure each word has it's own unique sound at the beginning.

As for how they are chosen? Many of them have been around since codes were first invented and remain due to status quo. Alpha, Beta and Delta are actually names for the equivalent forms of ""A"" ""B"" and ""D"" from the Greek Alphabet. And others have been included because they work better and/or are easier to remember than their predecessors.",eli5

It was similar to putting them in jail, it was meant as punishment. We quickly realized this caused WWII so after the war the allies tried to actually prop up Germany for various reason, to combat the Russians or to actually help out etc. This was more like rehabilitating Germany compared to punishing them. To add to that the German people themselves have gone through great efforts to fix what they could. They have immense amounts of Holocaust museums and I believe their schools even teach the Holocaust in an effort to prevent it from happening again compared to just a history subject. 

Today they have a very powerful GDP especially for how small their population is which is in part to the post-war efforts. If memory serves they also played an integral part in establishing the EU (possible to prevent another Holocaust).

bmsjg8,- how is it that pot eases or stops nausea/vomiting but can also cause cannabis hyperemesis syndrome or cyclical vomiting? ,"Biologist here!

When THC hits the brain, it bonds to special forms of dopamine and serotonin receptors that the body uses to trigger vomiting and nausea. Since opiates are very dopamine like, they can bond to these receptors as well, causing nausea.


But when THC bonds to it, it attaches to it without actually activating it. This blocks the bodies nausea chemicals from forming a bond until the body can send the enzyme to break it down.


THC, for a reason were not too sure of yet, also bonds to receptors inside the intestines that trigger reflex nausea and vomiting, but with the thc stimulating the receptors without triggering its switch in the brain, the puke signals are over powered


We think that when the thc bonds to the gut in normal people, we get nauseous but the brain being stimulated by the THC takes priority, it blocks out the puke signal and we go about our high,

But as a tolerance builds, the liver and brain find a faster way to break the THC off of the puke receptors, allowing the vomiting signals from the gut receptors, a place the brain receptor enzyme has no effect.

Since the “high” becomes shorter and shorter and it takes more and more thc to effect the brain, CHS and vomiting can be triggered by THC still in the blood but metabolized from the brains chemical receptors, allowing the gut signals to say “PUKE HOMIE!” And the brain say “ON IT BRO”",eli5

4zygih,Why can a pharmaceutical company hike prices? Shouldn't competition from other market entrants keep the price closer to equilibrium?,"In theory, they can't, at least not to the extremes they have been doing. Because as you state, competition would quickly jump in and stabilize the prices.

But there are three problems that make this not so simple, in the pharmaceutical market.

The first and largest issue is the FDA's barrier to entry. They are big. Giant. Gargantuan. Monstrous. So large, very few ever try to develop a new drug or even develop an existing generic drug. It's simply too expensive and time consuming to be worthwhile most of the time. Good or bad, the FDA dramatically reduces competition in the market.

The second issue are patents. And when I say issue, I mean purely in terms of competition, per your question. I'm not trying to make a comment on if these things are necessarily a net positive or negative. Just giving reasons. Patents restrict innovation within a field, but they do give ideas more value. But if you hold a specific patent on a drug and no one else can make it, you have a temporary monopoly. Many decide to capitalize on this. 

Third and finally, pharmaceutical R & D is incredibly expensive and challenging in of itself. Even without the FDA's barriers in place, this market has natural barriers that also serve to constrict competition. Not much can be done to change this final one.",eli5

75rn2o,How come in soccer the clock counts up?,"It's been well answered but I'll just add the key here, is that the ref has the last say on the clock. There is not a separate crew that controls it. It's either in sync with the ref or roughly follows the referee timeline.


The arbitrary nature of referee discretion is an integral facet of the game. For example, a ref may not account for game stoppage if the player was faking injury to buy more playing time. In addition, the ball going out of bounds does not factor in, unless for some outside reason, the ref decides it does like some strange occurrence with an object on the field or an issue with the game ball itself.


Lastly, I don't know how formalized this is, but the ref doesn't tend to stop a game mid dribble. Often times a striker heading towards goal will be given time. If the ball is passed, lost or moved into a backwards direction then the ref will blow the whistle. This could all be in my head but I don't believe the ref would ever set up a scenario involving a millisecond buzzer beater shot, I think he'd let it play out to a sensible point. 


The ref controlling the time in an inexact matter is as important as the umpire calling balls and strikes by eye, a golpher placing his own ball on the course rather than having an independent 3rd party do it for him, etc...

This means something as insubstantial as the leaves of trees might interfere with communication, meaning they are usually line of sight and short range.

There are concerns about health because people are stupid. Not just foolish and gullible, but really down right **stupid**, thunderously ignorant, moronic, and generally antithetical to reasoned thought.

 >  Actually, if you could explain it in such a way that tells me not to worry, that would be great.

You have probably heard that ""radiation"" is bad for your health. But what you probably haven't heard is that there are a huge number of different kinds of ""radiation""; light itself is a form of radiation. You radiate body heat all the time, you read a book via radiation. So what differentiates a dangerous radiation from a normal kind?

The issue is if the radiation is ""ionizing"". Some kinds of radiation are powerful enough to knock electrons out of an atom and in so doing charge the atom positively, creating an ""ion"" of that element. When that happens it changes how that atom reacts chemically and will likely result in an alteration to whatever molecule that atom might have been a part of. This can be a big problem if that molecule happens to be your DNA for example, the blueprint for how your body should work. The vast majority of such damage kills the cell. Examples of ionizing radiation include far UV light, X-rays, gamma rays, and particle radiation from radioactive substances.

In very rare instances the alteration to the DNA won't actually result in the cell dying but instead the turning off of certain pieces that inhibit its growth. With those sections disabled the cell can grow out of control becoming what is called ""cancer"". This is how the UV light in sun exposure can cause skin cancer, or how someone exposed to radioactive material might form tumors.

Now in contrast visible light, infrared light, microwave (the stuff used in WiFi and 3G/4G/5G), and radio waves are not ionizing. They don't have the energy to knock electrons off of atoms and therefore cannot alter the chemical structure of molecules, including DNA. So people whining about 5G towers are in essence whining about the potential damage caused by your light bulb in your bathroom, namely *nothing at all*.",eli5

61o6op,Why is poverty level related to diabetes risk? ,"Type 2 diabetes has a lifestyle attribute to it. That means that in many cases (not all) a person's lifestyle can have an effect on their chances of developing the disease. 

When you consume large amounts of carbohydrates (sugar, starch, breads, stuff like that) it puts pressure on your pancreas to produce insulin. You also start to develop **insulin resistance**. You are still making insulin (other types of diabetes like type 1 cannot make insulin) but that insulin isn't as effective. Therefore you need to make more and more. This basically tires the pancreas out and you develop type 2 diabetes.

So how does that relate to poverty? Carbs are cheap. Cheaper and more processed foods are going to, on average, contain more carbs. If someone is struggling with money, they may choose to buy something that is higher carb but cheaper. Overtime this can cause the insulin resistance described above.",eli5

It seems to be really obvious when you make eye contact with someone, even though the position of the other person's pupils barely moves compared to when you are not making direct eye contact with them.","Eye contact is actually an extremely important form of communication in humans. We can impart a *ton* of information with only our eyes and no other gestures or words.   
It's even important for infants who stare at their parents to get their attention. So it's in us from birth.  
There are actually parts of our brains that are so good at detecting eye contact that those parts wont fire if the gaze is only off by a few degrees; like someone looking at a clock over our shoulders.  
   
So in answer to your question, it's so obvious because there are parts of our brains that fire specifically for that reason and they only fire for that reason.    
    
Incidentally, this is what's responsible for the 'psychic staring effect', which is the feeling that you're being watched from someplace outside of your vision -- when that feeling is accurate.  
What happens in the psychic staring effect is that you turn your head just enough for only a fraction of a second, that the stare enters your peripheral vision for only a fraction of a second and you don't consciously notice it.    
But those areas of your brain fire and the feeling is strong enough that it lingers. You eventually look around and find that the person is still staring at you.",eli5

If you don't want to watch the video I will just run over what I said in the video:

- There are four stages of sleep, each one gets deeper and deeper.

- There are two types of sleep, NREM and REM. REM only lasts about 90 minutes a night so it's pretty rare you'll wake up in this stage.

- REM is the stage in which you dream.

- If you wake up in the middle of the night, you will often just got back to sleep because you're still so groggy and most of your systems are shut down (of course it all depends on what stage you're in , but if it's the middle of the night I will assume you're deeply asleep) most of the time you won't even know you woke up!

- If you wake up and can't get back asleep, then you will have to start the cycle again and you will become tired and often grumpy.

25mboh,"why is the stock market necessary? It seems like the stock market is a place where rich people go to make more money without doing any actual work. Maybe it used to be necessary for companies to get a start, but for already established company, what's the point? It seems to me like it just fuels greed.

EDIT: okay so it looks like I need to clarify a bit. So I understand the need for companies to have funding for more expensive projects. But realistically, don't these huge companies have enough money to afford this risk without relying on shareholders money? Essentially what I'm saying is maybe if there were some point where a company could be deemed as self sustaining it would no longer need to rely on shareholders. 


And as for retirement, maybe if people were more responsible with their money and were paid more reasonable wages, they would be able to manage their finances without essentially gambling for their future.  ","The stock market is a way of selling small pieces of your company in order to get more money for whatever you need.

As a company, you want to be big and successful (typically). If you want to expand your company and you need to make a GIANT profit, or it takes forever. So instead, you put your company on the stock market. You ""buy""/keep 51% of all ownership to yourself, this way no one can do a ""hostile takeover"". This means 49% of your company can be ""sold"" to others willing to buy.

Rough example; 

So what happens is that you put you 1 billion dollar market worth company on the stock market. You create 100 million shares, you keep 51 million and sell the other 49 million shares for 10 dollars each. After 2 months, 10 million shares have been bought at the 10 dollar price. This means your company has made 100 million dollars. They use this money to invest in the company, making it worth more. So after 6 months, your company is worth 2 billion. So each share is actually worth 20 dollars now. People will notice your massive growth and expect it to continue; more people buy stock = more money for your company = more expansion etc.

TL:DR;

If you're a company making 1 million profit a year and want to expand, it takes years. Where as on the stock market, the company can make millions in a few weeks.",eli5

jx6c1,Mass Effect plot. ,"Okay, I'm going to make this kinda quick and simple, spoilers are a given :P

You're a soldier called Shepard who is one of the best humans in the galaxy. Humans only just learned how to fly through space thanks to technology from an ancient race. This ancient race built massive slingshots throughout the galaxy called Mass Effect Relays that allow ships to travel further and faster than normal. Humans found this technology and discovered lots of other races that had a government called the Council on a massive city/ship called the Citadel. With space travel, the Council had to allow humans to join, but not all of the other races trust humans as we get angry too quickly and act too quickly.

As one of the best humans in the galaxy, you hope to join a super space soldier group called the Spectres (humans have never joined before). On a mission, an existing Spectre called Saren kills one of your teammates and brings a race of robots called Geth to the planet you're on. While fighting these robots, you find an object called the Beacon that gives you visions of another massive robot race called Reapers. Saren escapes and you go home.

You become a Spectre and your first job is to find Saren after his betrayal, who the Council think is going to use the Geth to attack them. The Council don't believe your visions and tell you to do your job. As the game continues, you get more friends to join your crew and find out that Saren is working for the massive robots, which are called Reapers. Saren is working directly with a Reaper called Sovereign, who you learn is actually controlling Saren's mind, so even if he didn't want to help, he didn't have a choice. 

The Reapers are in a different part of the Galaxy, and are waiting to teleport directly to the Citadel and kill everything there, but it relies on Sovereign and Saren, as it turns out the Citadel is actually a Mass Effect Relay, and when activated, the Reapers can appear there, which will destroy any army that tries to defend it. The Reapers reappear every time that alien races get too smart, and kill them again and again in a cycle, like the old civilisations before you were wiped out.

You find Saren and he teleports directly to the Citadel with some old technology, and you have to chase him, trying to stop him and Sovereign, as if the Reapers can teleport to the Citadel, nothing will live.

You go through the teleporter and it turns out the Geth are helping the enemy, so you have to fight through to them to get to Saren. When you find Saren, you have to fight him, but he knows he has been brainwashed by the Reapers. He kills himself, but the Reapers take control of his body through robotic implants and you have to kill him. While you do this, Sovereign is killed by your ship and the Navy, but heavy losses are taken (you have to make the choice of whether to let the Council die (which takes effect in the next game) or let lots of humans die (again, has an effect in the next game)

Either way, with Sovereign killed, the Reapers cannot teleport to the Citadel, so you are safe for now, but that doesn't mean the Reapers don't have other ways of getting to your galaxy, which is the premise of the second game, which is coming up!",eli5

1y20rr,Why is it when you leave a very loud environment (eg. Nightclub) your ears feel muffled? What has physically happened for your hearing to go so bad? ,"False. While it is true that repeated loud noise exposure can damage the hair cells that occurs slowly. 

When you experience loud noise your body has two muscles that help to protect the hair cells by dampening the noise that comes in. When sound comes into the ear it strikes the tympanic membrane causing it to vibrate. This is attached to three small bones which are connected to the cochlea which contains the hair cells bathed in fluid. The point is to take sound energy and convert it into mechanical energy and then to electrical energy via hair cells. Imagine a speaker or subwoofer and how you can see the speaker cone physically move. Now imagine that underwater and the ripples it would make. Those ripples move the fluid around the hair cells which our body interprets as sound. 


In my studies the mechanism most discussed for its protective ability is the stapedius muscle. It's attached to the third and final bone between the tympanic membrane and cochlea and will contract if is exposes to something like 80 dB. In doing so it will prevent the stapes bone from moving as much, dampening the ""volume"" of sound coming in. Imagine holding the speaker come with your hand so that it couldn't vibrate as much, the ripples underwater wouldn't be as big. There's another muscle called the tensor tympanum that does the same thing but is a muscle attached to the tympanic membrane. For whatever reason beyond me I don't hear about it nearly as much as the stapedius but they both work. 

After you leave the club those muscles are still flexed so that's why you hear that ringing. (Or so we think). We don't understand ringing of the ears (tinnitus) as well as we would like. There are tons and tons of causes for tinnitus in general, but the tinnitus after being in a loud club is temporary and the best correlation is those protective muscles seem to coincide with the tinnitus. 

The hair cells die only after they've been exposed to loud volumes repeatedly. The ripples in the fluid of the cochlea have to move  back and forth hard and repeatedly over time to damage them which doesn't cause noticable damage until it occurs many times. With that being said in-ear headphones have been attributed to causing a good degree of hearing loss in people as they listen to loud music with these headphones so far into their ears so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that you have some hearing loss due loud volume exposure. But that is permanent and is associated with more constant tinnitus which is not the temporary tinnitus you're describing.",eli5

9j745j,"Why is raising your heart rate through exercise good for your health, but raising your heart rate through stress or drugs is bad for your health?","""Stress"" is a very generic term and can mean good or bad things. Exercise is a good form of stress. It temporarily elevates your heart rate, allowing your cardiovascular system to become stronger and potentially reduce blood pressure and resting heart rate, which is good for you. It also causes the release of beneficial hormones that can improve your mood and make you feel better physically. Of course it can be over done. You don't want to be doing cardio 24/7, or your body would never recover and you'd probably have a heart attack eventually.

 & #x200B;

Bad stress like a terrible job, or a rough breakup, causes the release of hormones that elevate your heart rate and constrict your blood vessels, increasing blood pressure and making the heart work way harder than it should have to. The difference from exercise is these effects might last for a really long time and you're not getting the benefits of actual physical exertion. Highly stressed people don't usually just get stressed out for an hour and then everything is great for the rest of the day. This perpetually elevated heart rate can potentially lead to damage and things like heart attacks. The hormones also cause all other sorts of issues like weakening your immune system and causing premature aging. Similar effects can be seen with heavy use of certain drugs.",eli5

1ko1im,Why do I get these grand aspirations to become more productive at night when I'm about to go to bed but then the next day I just slouch around and do nothing? ,"The reason for this is you had a *preference reversal* due to *delay discounting*. 

First let me explain delay discounting. So pretend I ask you, would you like $20 now or $25 next month? Most people would say $20 now despite the fact $25 is more money. This is because they have ""discounted"" the value of $25 because of the ""delay"" (1 month). So essentially $20 now  >  $25 in one month. 
Work is an activity that does not pay off immediately, instead it pays off later so the benefit is *delayed*. Slouching, or any other activity besides work, pays off right now so there is no delay. 

So now let me explain the preference reversal. It is the night before and you are thinking about the next day. Right now work is worth +20 and slouching is worth +15 because you know work is more valuable tomorrow than slouching and both of them are *delayed*. Therefore you have a great aspiration to do work tomorrow. So right now work  >  slouching. 

Now you wake up the next morning and you have the same choice between work and slouching. The problem is now the benefit from work is still *delayed*, but the benefit from slouching is immediate and therefore NOT discounted. Work is still worth +20, however because slouching is not discounted its value goes up to +25. So now work  <  slouching, a preference reversal.",eli5

This is actually a pretty big topic that gets complicated fast. Especially when it comes to helping prevent these pests.

I'm a certified pest control technician. 

Edit: you living in a new house has nothing to do with it. You can caulk and seal holes to help reduce activity, and residual pesticide treatments in key areas before the first real good drop in temp can help.",eli5

1bey11,How did the T's get lumped in with the LGB movement? ,"Both trans people and lesbian/gay/bi people challenge the ""usual"" idea of gender and sex.

For instance. Before the LGBT movement, people generally thought that being a woman meant being born with female crotch parts and being attracted to men. If you didn't have one of those things, that made you less of a women. Trans women want to be recognized as fully women despite not being born with womany parts, and lesbian women want to be recognized as fully women despite not wanting relationships with men. So it's kinda natural for the two to go do their activism together.

However, I should note that they often *aren't* all that lumped together. Mainstream LGBT groups primarily focus on the LG and maybe B parts. The groups claim that this is because it's harder to do trans activism, but some trans people think the groups just don't care much about them.",eli5

Some console games allow you the option to fully install a games content to your hard drive and it takes just as much time as a standard pc. The reasoning for this is because read time is faster from a hard drive than from a cd drive resulting in much smoother gameplay.

Edit.
Another factor to consider in your 1 hour load time (which to me is unheard of in modern computing unless you have a really old machine.)  is pc hardware being used. Not all disc drives are alike.

71o3ul,Why do TI calculators cost so much for what seems to be outdated technology?,"Because textbook writers have all standardized on the TI calculator family. That has led pretty much all math teachers to standardize their lesson plans around the TI calculator family, their capabilities, quirks, button layouts and other features.this allows for a more streamlined lesson plan, and it prevents having to deal with one calculator being able to do a particular problem, but another that gives an incorrect answer due to a rounding quirk. Or to an operation having a key vs having to look it up in the programs.  

Imagine you have a class of thirty kids, teaching a particular lesson could go 1 of 2 ways:  
  
1. All kids have the same calculator, so you go through your exploration, and demo with the same calculator they have. Then you go back and catch up the stragglers.      

2. There are 8 different models of calculators, and 2 of them are new to market this year, so you've never seen them until today.  You go through the lesson with the TI85, then your HP 86+++, and the bell rings before you get to the Dell, Visio, Brocksonic or the rest. Now you have 15 kids who have cheaper but different calculators that need special attention or they won't get the assignment completed and your next batch of 30 kids will start arriving in 90 seconds.  

So now that TI has 100% of the high school market, and by extension most of the college market, they can charge whatever the market will pay. At the same time there is no need to innovate because there is no threat of competition.",eli5

6kyqt9,"why do Animals always seem hungry 


","All animals eat to survive, and that survival instinct drives hunger. This applies to humans as well.

Animals all have different methods of taking in energy. 

Herbivores typically graze continuously, and some actually have to otherwise they will go into gut stasis and die - see guinea pigs, the most common sufferers of this. Herbivores are therefore continuously ""hungry"". This is why guinea pigs will squeak very loudly whenever a fridge door is opened (ask me how I know).

However carnivores and omnivores, particularly reptiles and other cold blooded organisms, will eat a single large meal and ""store"" it, as fat and HTP, to be utilised later for energy. See big cats and wolves for reference. 

This applies to domestic cats and dogs as well. But pets are treated differently by humans - we ""meter"" their consumption, giving them one or two small meals per day, rather than a single large meal all at once every three or four days. This messes with the hunger instinct, and results in most carnivorous or omnivorous pets appearing to be hungry at all times.",eli5

7cim7u,why is it easier to balance on a bike while going faster rather than slower? ,"NOT because of gyroscopic force, as many people think...

If you look at a bicycle, where the front wheel attaches is further forward than the head tube (where the fork attaches to the rest of the bike).  This is an important design feature, because it means that when the bike veers to one side, the front wheel has a tendency to turn to that side, causing the bike to turn instead of fall over.  It's a sort of auto-correction: even if you just shove a bicycle forward with no one steering it fast enough, the bike may turn, but will resist falling until it slows down to the point that it makes too drastic of an adjustment and falls over.",eli5

3y0kut,Why are the biggest tech companies in America on the west coast?,"Two reasons that I know of:

One, the simple network effect. Many early tech companies were in the area, and especially in the early days, new tech companies usually formed when a few engineers with an idea left a previous company to pursue their new idea. And they'd stick in the area because that's where all the other high tech engineers were— you want to be able to hire people.

Two, a side effect of [military spending.](_URL_0_) WWII radar research and the Manhattan Project moved an assload of smart, driven people into the general area. Then, tons of Cold War military research spending going into places like Stanford, produced a lot of tech investment.

I suspect California's higher education system also has something to do with it— until relatively recently, it was possible for any resident in the top ~1/8 or so of their high school class to get a university education there, at a world-class university. (I think California schools were funded by the old Land Grant system, designed to provide a scholarship to anyone who would really be able to benefit from it.) Obviously if you have a bunch of people with good education (and without super debt) they are more likely to produce powerhouses like Silicon Valley.",eli5

And they actually take up very little space compared to the land area that people have settled. All the landfills in the United States combined only amount to the surface area of a few counties. 

Amd recycling isn't always a great long-term solution. Recycling plastic is an OK stop gap measure, but each time you recycle it, the long chains that comprise plastic molecules get a little bit shorter, so it can't be recycled indefinitely.  And it's more expensive and energy-consuming to recycle plastic than to make more plastic, so it's not very economical either. 

Recycling paper is fine for some uses, but if it's important that the end product be white, then you have to bring in bleaches that create their own environmental problems. 

Aluminum is one substance that's indisputably a good idea to recycle, though.  Cleaning, melting, and purifying aluminum is undeniably cheaper and easier than mining it and extracting it from its natural ores.",eli5

I don't really know why though.,"The two most common credit card brands, Visa and Mastercard, provide a service to banks, but not directly to merchants. Merchants contract with banks to accept credit cards, and the banks compete with each other to attract merchants to their services. This competition drives down the rates that they charge to accept Visa and Mastercard products.

American Express contracts directly with the merchants (this has been changing in recent years, though), and sets its own rates. Generally speaking, it costs much more per transaction to accept an American Express card than it does to accept a Visa or Mastercard. American Express also maintains more strict requirements for merchants, and many new businesses lack the credit rating to qualify as an AmEx merchant.",eli5

2zyebk,"Why are schools and other organizations pushing for more students to pursue the ""skilled trades"" as their career path? I live in Canada and all throughout high school and middle school especially, there were so many workshops and career days based around the ""skilled trades"" and how to pursue them. I even heard one lady at a career day say ""Yeah we're trying to push kids to go into the skilled trades because so many kids are unemployed coming out of university."" Is that true? From what I understand a university degree is extremely valuable, but a skilled trade is also sometimes the ""best route"" (as they said) for many people who may not be able to afford higher education. I'm just wondering if there's a reason for this increase of interest in skilled trade professions, because I see it a lot more now than I did before when my sister was in high school. ","Most likely because there's a shortage of skilled tradesmen in North America.

We're about 2 generations into a cultural movement that pushed the belief that you need a college degree in order to be financially sucessful.

The result is that the actual market for college degrees can't support the supply being pushed through, and universities being able to charge more because of the inflated demand.

Trades, on the other hand, have been neglected, leaving the supply of tradesmen low and the demand for trade education low. Trades do pay well, though, and exceptionally so because there is more demand than supply for tradesmen.",eli5

Unless I'm mistaken, that means pumping lots of adrenaline into the body quickly.  The problem with this is that a weak/diseased heart can't cope with the sudden surge/demand for a higher pulse, and so fails completely.

\* edit: Basically, the human body (and other animals) has evolved to survive quickly, and a surprise/shock is, or at least can be a mortal threat, so the body has evolved to respond shock/surprise by making itself ready, very very quickly, to either fight an enemy or run away.  This means increasing the heart rate (and other things) to ensure that (for example) the muscles have increased levels of oxygen and energy to be able to hit as hard as possible or run as fast as possible.",eli5

1r27j4,"- Why are passenger trains (like Amtrak) so expensive? It's now a comparable price to get a ticket on a passenger train to getting a ticket to fly. I know they've got freight trains rolling around all the time, why can't they consolidate those trips and hook a passenger car or two on there? ","My SO and I took am amtrak up to Buffalo last christmas from New York

the amtrak tickets cost us $285 for two people, round trip, relaxing with large seats, plenty of room to move around, a great view of pretty much the breadth of Upstate New York, plug points for our laptops, and WiFi (albeit a bit slow). A similar flight would have been faster, and for 50-100$ more, might have been better - but it was a comfortable ride at a price that was not that much worse than a plane.

Depending on where you are going, and how early you book, Amtrak also has various deals/specials that can sometimes beat the price/hassle of dealing with a plane - with Amtrak (at least from what i remember at Penn station) there is far less stress in getting on and off the train.

Of course planes have the advantage of being able to choose airports, whereas Amtrak is kind of stuck to its line, so to speak. Airliners do not have to maintain the airports or the air itself, but Amtrak has to keep miles of railway and wiring working through bad weather.

Plus there aren't going to be as many people crammed on that car as there could be on an airplane. There aren't always as many riders, and the stops are more controlled - meaning smaller ridership. With fewer riders, this means higher prices for a particular journey in order to keep costs the same.

The entire point of this is to make sure that even the poor can receive basic services. If you don't give a fuck about anyone but yourself then you'd rather pay for just your own service and let everyone else go without. You could even get yourself a much better service since you have more money and let others have a much worse service. If you give a fuck about other people then you want to make sure that even if things go badly for someone in life they can still access services they need, and this means paying more taxes if you're well off.

Birds of prey can glide great distances without flapping their wings, so by gliding in a circle they can linger around one position without exerting themselves too much.  It's even better for them if there's a ""thermal"", an updraft of warm air - they can actually gain altitude by gliding in a circle inside a thermal.  These often occur above asphalt roads out in the country, which is coincidentally a great place for a vulture to spot some roadkill.

Secondly, they're probably watching to make sure that their target is actually dead, and that there aren't any other predators in the area.  Birds are very fragile, and they don't want to get smacked by their prey's death spasms or attacked by a coyote.",eli5

1bewwu,Why do I feel happy when I hear a major chord but sad when I hear a minor chord? How does one semitone change my emotional response to musical sound? ,"Good question. There is no easy answer but as far as I can tell, the feeling of happiness comes from the pitch of the notes in the chord all being related in a fundamental simple manner. For example, the major chord A consists of the triad of notes A, C# and E. Here A is called the root, C# the third and E the fifth.

Now check the frequencies of each of these notes:
A= 440 Hz 
C#= 550 Hz (approx)
E= 660 Hz (approx)

If you notice, the third and the fifth are related to the root and to each other in simple ratios of 5/4, 3/2 (6/4) and 6/5 respectively. Whereas if you take a minor chord, the notes are:

A= 440 Hz
C= 523 Hz
E= 660 Hz

The ratio is not that simple,so it the sound is rather more complex than the immensely satisfying major chord sound.

I hope this is the right explanation. I am a musician but not trained formally in classical music theory, though I know a bit.",eli5

That got me thinking why does it hurt so much more to hit a cold body part? For those from warmer climates when you're hands in particular are cold, small impacts that normally go unnoticed hurt like a b! & $","Your body reacts to coldness by decreasing blood flow in your limbs in order to keep your core on operating temperature.
As low blood flow = less function, your fingers and toes start feeling numb and you lose dexterity as they're stiffing up, which is all a result of your nerves being numbed as well.
But interestingly enough, probably for safety reasons, your pain receptors still work, unlike many others.

So this means, that the input you normally have is ""turned off"", while pain is the only one still being ""transmitted"", which can be compared to being on a concert with a crying baby next to you (you won't really notice) or being in a quiet room with the same baby (really annoying).",eli5

3uv4fn,Why is apple removing features from its new products? ,"I assume you're asking about the headphone jack?

This is basically standard Apple behaviour.  Apple has the reputation of having devices that “just work”.  But that’s not magic, it’s not because Apple are better programmers than Microsoft or anything like that at all.  Apple devices tend to “just work” because Apple maintains control over every element in the interaction.

A large part of that is that Apple does not concern itself with how people want to use its devices.  Apple decides how people are going to use the devices and if the customers would rather use another way they are simply out of luck. 

In this case, Apple has decided to push everyone to wireless headphones or to headphones that have a lightning connector.  The reasons here could be economic (Apple gets a royalty for every device with a lightning connector) or it could be technical (for whatever reason Apple wants a 2 way data connection with all headphones, perhaps for some future functionality).

2gkop4,Why do moths like light so much?? ,"they don't. The leading theory is that moths use moonlight to navigate. The moon, being so far away, maintains a relatively fixed position in the sky from the standpoint of a moth. It maintains the moon in its field of vision, and its position doesn't change as the moth travels.

A bright light, being perceived as the moon, might cause the moth to reorient itself. As it flies forward, the light, much closer than the moon, begins to pass the moth, causing it to reorient again to maintain the light in its vision. It turns towards the light source to put it back 'on track.' The result is an inward spiral.",eli5

9neae0,"why is it more efficient to produce energy by fusion instead of nuclear power? i once read an article where it says fusion is like one million times more efficient to gain power then a power plant (hope you get the point, english isn't my first language)

Edit: i mean fission vs fusion","Firstly to clearify some of the vocabulary. Both fusion and fission power is nuclear power. Our current nuclear power plants are fission based, which means they split heavy atoms in a chain reaction to produce energy. Those heavy elements have to be mined, enriched and within the running power plant they have to be moderated and controlled to prevent an explosion. All that takes a lot of resources and energy.

Fusion would mean to take very light atoms and fuse them together. That fusion also produces energy. Since the light atoms are much smaller, a lot more fusion events can happen in the same space and time than splitting heavy elements. That means the energy density in fusion is much higher. There also are more benefits to fusion. The raw material we need for fusion is way cheaper and cleaner to produce (basically water), the fusion leaves much less waste behind (basically helium) and the chain reaction of a fusion plant isn't self sustaining. That means a breach will let the fusion reaction fizzle out instead of explode.",eli5

xlnjc,"Why I need to flush toxins out of my system
 after a massage. Are there really toxins stored in my muscles? What ate they, and if they were already in my body why does the massage suddenly make them a concern? Does drinking water actually flush them out? How? ","You don't.

Your muscles normally produce a variety of waste products, like all the cells in your body, like lactic acid (a byproduct of anaerobic respiration, which is normal and happens constantly). Your body already has mechanisms to deal with waste products, by degrading most of them in the liver and excreting them through the kidneys or intestines.

You should consider asking your massage therapist for the names of specific toxins that need to be flushed so that you can look up the normal biological processes in which they're involved. 

There is an exception to this that comes to mind, in the case of uncontrolled cell death (necrosis). Normally, when a cell is too old or damaged it ""commits suicide"", called apoptosis, by packaging itself up and eventually falling apart into a well-organised set of remains. This happens to billions of your cells every day. Uncontrolled and unplanned cell death, though, doesn't allow the cell to package itself before death and, when it bursts, it can make the surrounding area more toxic to other cells. This is only significant when it happens en masse, like in a heart attack (""myocardial infarction"") or when you've had a tourniquet on a limb for long enough for tissues to die off. This is not going to happen from a massage unless your therapist is actually trying to kill you.

e: Drinking water is good. It always has been, and it is indeed one way that your body excretes waste, drug metabolites, salts and so on. But you don't need to drink water just because someone gave you a back massage; that's your therapist trying to sell you on the power of their massage by implying that it could have side-effects.",eli5

14ude0,"Why are public key encryption algorithms like RSA unsafe from quantum computers? Specifically, what is it about the math that makes large numbers easy to factor?","Why RSA is secure:
Ok, the difficulty of breaking RSA lies in the fact that if you take two very large, random prime numbers (divisible by only themselves and one) and multiply them together, you get an extremely large number. The only way to find the original two numbers is to guess them and check if they multiply to the large number, over and over again. The difficulty of this increases at an increasing rate (exponentially) for every additional digit in the big number. This is called the [factoring problem](_URL_0_). If you can find the original two numbers, you can decrypt the message. (It's a bit more complicated than that in any secure standard, but you can assume that if you find those two numbers, all the hard work is done.)

Quantum computers: 
For the sake of explanation, let's assume processing power = monkeys. If you have a finite number of monkeys, all guessing numbers and checking them, it takes near-infinite time to find the desired numbers. This is comparable to a current computer attempting to find the numbers by brute force. Note this: no matter how many monkeys you have available, if you have a finite number, the task is still almost impossible. (I say nearly because it is limited by the size of the original key, but even on the fastest computers in the world currently, by the time you found the message, it would be out of date by a hundred years or so.)

Now, the equation changes completely if you have an infinite number of monkeys all guessing and checking numbers. The problem becomes relatively simple. This is known as non-determinism, and it's the whole idea behind quantum computers. Essentially, because the quantum computer can be in an infinite number of different states at once, the difficulty of finding an answer no longer increases exponentially with every additional digit in the big number. You can plug in any length big number, and find the small numbers within a few hours, instead of a few lifetimes.

3y8zi8,Why do musical chords sound good? Why do the notes that make up a major chord sound good together and others don't? Why do three random ones sound terrible?,"Acoustics, physiology, and cultural bias.  

Imagine each note on the piano is a square grid, and each grid is large or small depending on how the note is.  Now take two grids that have similar proportions and lay them on top of each other, this set will create shapes that are symmetrical and in alignment with the other grid.  Now imagine that you have two grids that aren't similar sizes, when you overlay these on top of each other the shapes that are created look random, and are definitely not symmetrical.  These grids are very similar to what happens acoustically with ""good sounding chords.""  Every note has an overtone series on top of it, which is like the grid, and when the notes are pleasing the grids line up in a sort of symmetry. You can see this mathematically as well, a perfect fifth, a very pleasing interval, the foundation of the power chord, is a ratio of 2/3.  But a minor second is a ratio of 11/12 (when tuned justly, which is a whole other thread). 

Our ears also process sound in a specific way based on how it is shaped.  Inside our ear, our hearing cells are kind of similarly laid out like a piano keyboard.  The nerve cells for things that aren't pleasing are close together, and some theorize that the cells are bumping into each other.  This bumping into each other could be unpleasant, but they are still trying to figure this out honestly.  If someone else knows more information about this please correct me! 

Finally cultural bias has a great deal to do with what sounds pleasing and good.  For example, Gamelan music from the south pacific uses a pentatonic scale with two notes that are close together but not in tune for each scale degree.  This scale is called the Pelog scale.  To westerners this music is very dissonant, but to those in the region the music is considered to be extremely beautiful.  Using the first example, this music uses grids that don't line up very symmetrically.  The culture of both regions impacts very much what people interpret to be ""good sounds.""

We don’t quite understand the complete reasoning behind why it happens but the main idea is that as your body pumps out more and more insulin (because you become insulin resistant as a diabetic), this high level of insulin activates certain proteins in your skin cells. This activation causes more and more pigment to be deposited in your skin.

kgfy4,Why 32-bit is referred to as x86 and 64-bit is referred to as x64? whats the go?,"Firstly, 32bit is not synonymous with x86. x86 denotes the original instruction set, derived from the first processor using it, the Intel 8086, which was a 16 bit processor. So, x86 really means ""derived from x86"". i386 on the other hand was used to refer specifically to compatibility of the (much more relevant) 32bit extensions of the 386 instruction set ""and up"". In the same spirit, i586 means  compatible to the 80586 processor and up. All of which are x86. Now, ever since the 80ies, we've been stuck with the need for backwards compatibility to that old pal 8086, so when Intel developed a 64 bit processor, they dropped the backwards compatibility completely, and ended up with the Itanium processor series, whose architecture is short handed *IA64*. Which is Intel and 64 bit, but has no roots in x86. The IA64 Platform is exclusively used in highly-priced enterprise high availability systems, such as the HP Superdome server, running UNIX (HP/UX).

Then AMD came and made it all good for us mere mortals with their implementation of a 64 bit instruction set on a x86 based cpu core. But this core is either in 32bit x86 mode OR in a special 64bit mode, an arrangement which needs to be reflected in the architecture type, so x86 didn't suffice anymore. Also, marketing. So the ""amd64"" shortcut became the de-facto reference to this architecture in places where you'd normally see ""i386"" or ""i586"" as a compatibility designation, no matter if the CPU was implemented by intel, amd or anyone else.

Now, analogue to x86, this architecture is correctly called *x86-64*, which denotes the x86-mangled-with-64-bit kind of arrangment that's now being used by every x86 based processor.

29dxv3,Why do you feel tired after a heavy meal? ,"In order to digest food, part of your nervous system, called the Parasympathetic nervous system, must be activated. It's also known as the ""rest and digest"" side of the nervous system. It's exactly the opposite of the ""fight or flight"" response that gets you energized and gets your blood pumping, and only one of those two systems can be active at a time. When your Parasympathetic system is active, your body releases lots of chemicals to help with digestion and also make you a bit sleepy. 

One reason for this is that it really doesn't want you to go running around after you eat, because that isn't good for your digestion. If you have a lot of food in your stomach, it's better for you to rest and chill out so that your body can send more of its blood flow to your stomach and intestines so that they can process your food. If you were to run around, it would have to send more blood to your muscles instead.",eli5

3iwiy2,Why is breaking the sound barrier visible to the human eye? ,"First thing you need to know is that sound is a compression wave. Meaning that air is squished together and that squishing action moves in an outward direction from the source of energy. When you clap your hands, you quickly squeeze all the air from out between your hands, and that air pushes the air around it in a wave, your eardrums pick this up and your brain perceives it as sound. 

Second thing is that air density has an effect on how light passes through it. Light passes through denser air slower than through less dense air. When light goes from traveling quickly to traveling slowly, its path bends, and this is visible to the eye. Imagine sticking your arm in a fish tank and noting the appearance that your arm has bent beneath the surface. 

Lastly, breaking the sound barrier means that the object creating sound is moving as fast as sound can move. Imagine running so fast that you kept pace with the air waves created by your footfalls. after your foot hits the ground, you keep moving forward at the same speed as the sound you've created, so what happens when your next footfall comes? It piles on top of the existing wave, and so on and so on. 

An observer to your little mach 1 morning jog would not hear you until you had passed them, and when they heard you, it would sound to them as though a thousand feet had struck the ground in the same instant. This is stacking of sound waves is called a sonic boom. The reason a camera can capture it is that the air is so compressed by repeated sound waves stacking on top of one another that the area affected by the sonic boom is so dense that it bends light enough to be visible.",eli5

I should add that I have only been a resident of the USA for 2 years, so the dynamics and issues that may seem obvious to a US citizen are not as clear to me.  ","Because it's off limits in the eyes of the American society. There are a great deal of semi-complex factors playing into this, which I will try to describe as simply as I can.

#Defense Spending

Defense spending actually encompasses a *much* larger field of spending than simply the US military. This spending includes massive amounts of funding for research, for government entities, ~~and for some things we don't actually know about. This is because we have not ever^1 successfully audited or defense spending. Auditing is taking account of everything. When we try to audit the US defense spending, we always^1 come up with the wrong number. A large amount of money, although not *that* large considering how much we're talking about in total, is never found. This is more than partly because of classified information; we just can't take a full account of all the spending because we aren't allowed to know where some of it is going.~~ **[EDITED:** Audits of the US Defense Spending are quite accurate as pointed out to me by the two redditors mentioned below, and the information that I was speaking of (and horrifically misrepresenting) from memory was actually about the inefficiencies of the spending as found by audits, such as in 2010 where Robert Gates commissioned an audit that found more that **$200 billion** in redundant expenditures (more than 1/4th of the military budget).**]** 

Defense Spending includes Military Spending in addition to intelligence work performed by the Department of Homeland Security, NASA, the CIA, etc, as well as research and production/maintenance of nuclear power/weapons by the Department of Energy, and expenditures by Veteran's Affairs and the Treasury Department (when relating to vets/families), as well as liaisons from different Federal departments to the military and the expenditures incurred by the projects they undergo alongside the military.


^1 ~~^as ^far ^as ^I ^recall, ^feel ^free ^to ^double ^check.~~ ^someone ^did, ^I ^was ^wrong.

#Military Specific Spending

Military spending is used inefficiently as a whole, but we aren't exactly a nation run by engineers. 

There are a lot more factors than you think that are a part of what we spend when it comes to our military. For instance, take tanks. We have  a *lot* of tanks. We have *so* many tanks that the US Army has actually told Congress that we have more than enough tanks, and we can stop building tanks. Did we stop building them? You bet your ass we didn't. Why?


Because politics. Because the manufacturing of the pieces of those tanks, as well as the assembly of those tanks, has to be done *somewhere*, and that somewhere is inevitably in the district of one of our Congressmen. That district, while tanks are in production, appears to be doing well economically. Not to mention the people making those parts will fund our Congressman's campaign handsomely next election so long as those tanks keep getting built. 

Now, this wouldn't necessarily be a *huge* issue, I mean, after all, there are only so many places you can build tanks. But then there is another political issue: Patriotism. What do you *mean* you don't want tanks? You don't *want* our soldiers to be prepared in the field? You *want* our men to be killed because they don't have the right equipment? You are the most anti-American person I have ever met!

It's sad, but the second you suggest military spending in your idea for where to cut money, that sounds like ""I hate the military, the veterans, and America"" in the halls of Congress. This brings me to the final point.

#Political Suicide and Realistic Goals

To even suggest cutting defense on your own is political suicide. Your opponents in the next election will run those statements over and over and over until every single person with a cousin in Afghanistan wants to see you run out of town on a rail. So, why don't they formulate the plan behind closed doors, like they do for everything else?

Well, because it's just not feasible. There are too many people too scared to lose their positions. In today's Congress, it's just not possible to get enough votes to reduce military spending (for all the reasons mentioned above and more). So, if you're in Congress, would you waste 6 years of your life trying and trying to reduce the money we spend on the military *knowing* from the outset that it is a doomed cause? Probably not. Best just see where else you can get that funding from.

#####EDIT: 

Thanks to /u/SwordfshII, for helping me correct my flawed knowledge of our auditing process and to /u/When_Doves_Cry for his [comment](_URL_0_) that accurately portrays what the ""failures"" of the US Defense budget that appear in our audits, that I horribly misrepresented in my explanation.

4e2jmx,"If amnesia makes us forget everything, why can we remember language.","Amnesia is rarely like it is portrayed in the movies. There's a couple types.

Anterograde amnesia: you can't form new memories, but you can remember your old ones. It's often the case they can't remember the recent past though (maybe up to a year or two since the event causing the amnesia). This is usually caused by brain damage to the memory formation areas in the brain. 

Retrograde amnesia: you can't remember the past. This can take some different forms. Very rarely, people have pure retrograde amnesia (they can't remember the past at all). Even though it's popular in media, it hardly ever happens. If you truly can't remember the past at all, it's likely you have brain damage and will also have trouble forming new memories. Most likely, you will either have trouble 1) remembering the recent past or 2) using your working memory (the memory you use to remember a string of numbers until you dial them or something).

Now, your main question: how could we remember language? Like I said, very rarely do people actually have pure retrograde amnesia without some serious brain damage. So for the majority of cases, people have partial amnesias, so deeply stored memories like language aren't going to be affected because you learn language so early in life (thus a long time ago) and have no problem remembering that far back. 

Also, it's there is a literal truth to ""depth"" of memory. Your brain is 3dimensional (surprise! lol), and some memories are stored in areas that are probably more protected from surface traumas on the brain. There's also a ""depth"" of neural connections. Deep memories have lots of neural connections that activate them, and the richness of these connections probably protect it from loss. Language would probably have a very rich system of connections. 

Interesting factoid, people with severe memory loss from alzheimers seem to lose core aspects of their identity last. So they may have trouble recognizing certain people, but they still know they don't like crowds or certain activities.",eli5

7dga0c,"Why do we ""feed"" bad emotions? For example why do we listen to sad songs when we're feeling like shit? Feeding that emotion and becoming even sader. 

Wouldn't it be more logical if your brain did everything it could to fight off conscious decisions that fucks with it.","To be honest, it's really hard to say from a scientific perspective

There are a few theories, depending on how you tend to associate yourself in psychology.

Some theorize that it's a catharsis effect, similar to Greek tragedy. You sit through the music for example, in all its sadness, and at the end, when the song is over, it helps make you feel like your sadness is also gone

Others believe it's more akin to shadenfruede, the feeling of pleasure you get when someone else faces misfortune. So you hear a song and knowing that someone else is sad makes you just a little happier

There are other theories too, and some explanations that touch more on the biological aspect of things, but we really don't know very well",eli5

1qehfd,"Why are the frets on a guitar different sizes? By sizes I mean they have different widths. Intuitively I think it has something to do with string length, but I am curious.","So, if you have a string and pluck it, it vibrates at a certain frequency and makes a certain note. If you pinch the string in half and pluck it, it'll vibrate at a frequency that is exactly twice as high as the original.

The frequency that's twice as high as the original is what we call an octave. So, when you fret on the twelfth, you're pinching the string in half (feel free to measure it out if you want), and that's why it's an octave higher.

If I want to get a note that's an octave higher than the twelfth fret, I have to subdivide that half-length by another half, ie a quarter. In other words, if I pinch the string so that it's a quarter of its length, I get a note that's two octaves higher, since it's half of a half. That would be the 24th fret. You might only be able to measure it if you're a metalhead, but I promise you that the 24th fret is 3/4ths of the distance from the nut to the bridge.

What that means, though, is that the distance I had to ""cut"" the string by to get my next octave is much shorter. For the first twelve frets, they're pretty wide, because my goal is to get 12 frets in between ""open"" and ""halfway down the string"" (an octave). For the next twelve, I have to squeeze twelve frets between ""halfway down the string"" and ""3/4ths of the way down the string,"" so they have to be much closer together. Hence, the frets get thinner as you go up.

edit: Also you may not care, but I find these things interesting. The speed at which a vibration travels through a string also affects the frequency it vibrates at, which is why different strings of the same length make different tones. Higher speed, higher frequency.

The speed at which the vibration travels is the velocity of wave propagation, which is given by the square root of the tension in the string divided by the mass per unit length (how much a given length of string weighs). There's an excellent breakdown of how it works in Chapter 9 of Griffiths' Introduction to Electrodynamics, for some reason.

So it's

v = sqrt(T/u)

where T is the tension and u is the mass per unit length. The relationship between wavelength (w), which you can roughly think of as how long the string is, and frequency (f), which is the pitch of the note, is, given by:

f = v/w

or

f = sqrt(T/u)/w

That's why the higher strings make higher notes; the vibrations travel through them faster because they're lighter. Make u smaller, f gets bigger (higher frequency = higher pitch). It's also why your tuning knob works, you're changing how much tension is in the string. Make T bigger, f gets bigger.",eli5

b70vtb,"Why do records sound better than digital? So I recently got into collecting vinyls, and I’ve always heard people say that they provide higher fidelity audio quality. I am running my turntable through a Bose speaker, but even if I play the same song off Spotify right after I play it on vinyl, it doesn’t sound nearly as rich, even through all the clicks and pops.  Don’t get me wrong, the Bose makes them both sound great, but on vinyl it sounds like band is right in the room with me. Why is this?  Why doesn’t digital provide as rich of a sound as records?  I understand a little bit about bitrates and stuff, but you’d think technology would have provided something better quality than 50 to 100 year old pieces of wax by now.  ","> I’ve always heard people say that they provide higher fidelity audio quality

That is actually false. Digital can provide higher fidelity than vinyl. People will say that vinyl can ""exactly reproduce"" the sound wave and digital is necessarily ""choppy,"" but neither one of those statements is true.

Any analog recording still has physical limitations - something still has to physically ""carve"" the waveform, and it's limited by the equipment and the medium. Vinyl has to be smoother than the actual sound wave can be, and the result is that can't capture high frequencies or sudden changes. Furthermore, the recording is degraded with every playback, as it is physically worn away.

As for digital, it is true that it can't perfectly reproduce a waveform. HOWEVER, *it can perfectly reproduce a signal within a given bandwidth*. This is [mathematically proven](_URL_0_). So yes, with a sampling rate high enough, you can **perfectly** reproduce all components of the sound within the range of human hearing. You might lose subsonic and supersonic components, but you can't perceive those anyway. And if you did want to capture them, you could arbitrarily extend the bandwidth you are capturing (so your dog can't tell the difference either), and it would simply make bigger file sizes.

In short, the difference you hear between vinyl and high quality digital is because the *vinyl* is imperfect. If it's ""better,"" that's because subjectively you prefer those imperfections to a more accurate recording.",eli5

If you don't have access to water but you have the facilities to store huge amounts of hydrogen (which is very difficult to compress) then you really have your priorities in the wrong order.

Hydrogen ~~is normally~~ **can be** produced via electrolysis - using a large electrical current to split water into hydrogen and oxygen - so supply is another issue you'd have to tackle.

Water, as a liquid, is far more dense than hydrogen gas and has the advantage of not being explosive, so it's easier, safer and more efficient to carry around.

The Dust Bowl crisis aside, ELI5: how did the Great Depression happen?","I am going to seriously oversimplify this on purpose, but basically, throughout the 1920's Americans (predominantly) became very accustomed to borrowing and not buying in real money. This wouldn't be such a big deal, but debt has to be backed by something and quite frankly, the debt got out of control against the backdrop - or lack thereof, of the debt-backing. Even still, this model can actually still work, but in order for it to exist, it requires confidence on the behalf of investors and an eventual return on investments. The perfect confluence of factors melded together at the end the 1920's wherein too much ""speculation"" on the behalf of investors, businessmen and others alongside too little debt backing, too few returns when debts and investments were called back in, too little actual production of goods/services, and a rising international trade shortage - all spurred in part by the Dust Bowl itself, led to a crash from which investors never *really* recovered until after the outbreak of WWII. Again, I want to emphasise that I am definitely over simplifying this whole thing and major schools of thought also look to the Federal Reserve, the money supply and others.

This makes the particles of items inside move a lot faster and therefore raise the temperature of the item. This works fine for foods etc, but for metals accelerating the particles means creating electricity. All that electricity cannot be contained inside the metal (since it is a conductor, which means it only passes the current along). This causes the electricity to escape in form of sparks.

My hunch is that it has something to do with voltage, but that's all I have. Please fill my knowledge gap.","It has to do with voltage, current, and connectors.  There's no standardization of any of those things for portable electronic devices, although there have been some positive movements in voltages and connectors.  A lot of things can be powered over USB, so if you have a power supply that has all of the major USB connectors a lot of things are covered.   
  
But any power supply that can provide enough power to something like a laptop is going to be overkill for something like a cell phone.  And some small devices need to have a small connector, usually providing both power and USB connectivity over the same cable.  
  
You can buy gizmos that will provide power to a lot of things, and all you have to do is change the connector. They are capable of providing multiple voltages at fairly high current, and the connector tip hooks up only to the correct voltages for that thing. Of course, as soon as you buy a new device that has a connector that's not supported you are out of luck. Or if you buy one that needs more power than the gizmo can source.",eli5

","""Recent studies have identified areas of the brain that are activated by itch-inducing stimuli, including those involved in motor control to initiate scratching. The somatosensory cortex helps to localize and determine the intensity of the itch. The prefrontal cortex, which contributes to decision making, is considered to be a key part of the “pleasure/reward” center. It has been observed that the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine stimulates this brain center to feel pleasure in “peak experiences,” such as from solving a difficult problem or having an orgasm. It is hypothesized that the perceived pleasure from stimulation of the prefrontal cortex may be related to addictive behavior in drug users, cigarette smokers, and perhaps even chronic “scratchers.”  - sauce _URL_0_",eli5

Thanks in advance

EDIT: Clarification on question","It is caused by Capillary action (sometimes capillarity, capillary motion, or wicking). Capillary action is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition to, external forces like gravity. The effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint-brush, in a thin tube, in porous materials such as paper, in some non-porous materials such as liquified carbon fiber, or in a cell. It occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces. If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of surface tension (which is caused by cohesion within the liquid) and adhesive forces between the liquid and container act to lift the liquid. In short, the capillary action is due to the pressure of cohesion and adhesion which cause the liquid to work against gravity.",eli5

2xkt5m,"Why were cults such a seeming phenomenon in America in the 1960s and 1970s? I just finished watching a documentary about The Source Family, and it seems to me that I'd heard about a lot of other cults specifically active during this time period. Why is that? Thank you! ","Cults did not exist before the 1940s. I mean they did...but before the 1940s the word cult did not have a negative connotation. The word merely means a group of religious adherents. During the 1940s, Conservative christian groups began a campaign against non orthodox religious practices.   
Studies in the 1920s and 1930s of american religious cults are anthropological discussions of variations of religious practice across various socioeconomic, geographic, ethnic, and ancestral backgrounds.   
By the 1940s, writings on cults had shifted to focus on any factor that would shock and appall the conservative audience they were written for. At the same time, abusive groups have always existed....so there were certainly some real cases that were legitimately reported. Much of the cult phenomena however is manufactured.  

Now with all that said.....  
the time period you mention is so known because there was great social disrest in that era. Groups of youth banding together and living in communal environments was far more common then. This sort of dynamic is ideal for certain personality types to take advantage of....and the people who join these groups are often so lost that misguiding them in your own benefit is easier than it should be.",eli5

5ixxtr,"Why does 60fps/120fps look and feel faster than 30fps, but the higher the fps, the slower it should appear? ","**If we're referring to video footage:**

It's not just the frame rate of playback that matters; it's the framerate of the recording.

If the playback FPS and the footage FPS are **equal**, the footage will proceed at real time, the way it was shot.
If the playback FPS is **faster** than the footage FPS, the footage speeds up because an event that happened in real time is being displayed at a faster rate than it was captured
If the playback FPS is **slower** than the footage FPS, the footage slows down because the event is being displayed at a slower rate than it was captured.

If we're referring to the equal scenario, a higher recorded **and** playback FPS does give some people the impression of things looking and feeling ""faster"" but all that's really happening is that you're seeing more ""inbetween"" frames, IE you're getting more detail from playback.

**If we're referring to video games:**

Games don't just process as fast as the FPS; they have built-in time-scales that understand how long it takes for a frame to be drawn (which can be loosely calculated from the FPS). In the Unity games engine for example, we have a feature called Time.deltaTime which allows us to work out how our frametimes are so we can scale the action on screen to how fast your computer is rendering.

If you have a low FPS, it means your computer isn't fast enough so is taking more real time to draw something happening on a fixed timescale. We can treat the game's timescale just the same as we treated recorded footage's ""real time"", and the time it takes the computer to draw it as our ""playback time"", though this is again loose and doesn't account for a lot of interesting quirks of software.

So, if we have a slow FPS, it means our playback time is going slower than our event time (or ""footage time""). So things seem slower.

If we have a high FPS, it means our playback time is going faster than our event time (or ""footage time""). However, because of the fixed timescaling inherent in video games, the game won't speed up out of control, making everything go all ""fast-forward"". Instead, this happens:

**With actual video footage**: There's only a finite number of frames. Once they're played, they're played, and there can't be any more.

**With a game**: The software can ALWAYS make new frames. If your playback device (i.e. your console or pc) can render 240 FPS, the game will spit out 240 FPS.

Hope that was simple enough.",eli5

2qubsp,Why is there a www. in websites? ,"**[UPDATE]** Apparently I carried on a bit too long about the capital vs. lowercase “I” in Internet. :-) Also, my post wasn’t simple enough for some folks. So here’s the **tl;dr**...

The “www” at the beginning of a web address is an old way of signalling that you want to talk to the web server for that domain. The web server is the program that will send you web pages, as opposed to data sent by some other kind of server, like email from a mail server or file transfers from an FTP server.

Over the years, most information on the Internet—though not all—is available via the web server, though, so most places dropped the “www” and if you ask for _URL_4_, they just assume you want to talk to the web server and that’s where the request goes.

**[UPDATE 2]** Here's some quick links to more answers I wrote below:

* [What's the `http` vs `https` bit all about?](_URL_9_)
* [Where is DNS data stored?](_URL_1_)
* [I want to play with DNS directly. Talk nerdy to me.](_URL_7_)

Now for those of you that want the non-tldr...

Original post
----
There is a difference between the ""world wide web"" and the ""Internet"".

The Internet (capital ""I""–though there's been talk over the last couple of years that the capital ""I"" should be dropped) refers to a world wide interconnection of networks. For instance, every major university has a campus network, and every big business, and many small businesses, and now many homes, and lots of other folks. If you have a network (also called a local area network, or LAN), that just means your various devices are connected to each other, but they're not accessible from outside.

If you want your devices to be accessible from some other device on some other network, you need to connect your network to that other network somehow. This is called an internetwork. The Internet is the idea someone had long ago, hey, let's make one standard internetwork (called the ""Internet"") that everyone can connect their network to, which means all those networks are then connected to each other and accessible from any other device on the Internet.

(It's worth pointing out that there are other internetworks besides the Internet that are completely separate. The US government, for instance, has more than one secure military internetwork that are completely distinct and independent and inaccessible from the Internet. Any internetwork is typically referred to in short as an internet, but this is obviously only useful in print where you can see the capital vs. lowercase ""I"". So, people are finding that when talking they need to say ""internetwork"" anyway when referring to an internet that is not *the* Internet. So, the capital ""I"" is kind of unnecessary anyway.)

Well it wasn't long before having access to devices on this giant network became really confusing. At first, you would just go to your computer and you know how your files are organized and everything, so you can just browse directly to the info you want from wherever you are on the Internet. But if you want someone else to get to your info, like if you're a company, that someone else would need to be familiar with how you structure your files and where to look. No, this is too complicated.

So instead, someone came up with the idea of an Internet service that makes everything look the same from the outside, using a protocol called HTTP. The collection of all the HTTP servers on the Internet form the ""world wide web"", or WWW. Now before we go farther, you have to know a little bit about how networks are named on the Internet.

A network is accessible through an IP address, but no one wants to have to remember that Google's IP address is some series of numbers. They'd rather just type in _URL_4_, which is a lot easier to remember. So, Google's network is associated with this name, _URL_4_, using an Internet service called the ""domain name service"" (DNS). The way DNS works is that you assign a name for your ""domain"" (which is one or more networks you own). Your domain might provide a lot of different services, a web server being just one. Fortunately, DNS allows you to set up what are called subdomains so you can divide up your domain namespace however you want.

So, if you have a web server on your network, and your network is associated with _URL_4_, it became standard practice to associate your web service with the www subdomain. Keep in mind that other services had other standard subdomains too (this ""standard"" is just a shared convention, there's nothing sacred about it...individual sites can do it differently if they want, and some do). So if your domain was _URL_0_, you could have your web server on www._URL_0_, and your mail server at mail._URL_0_, and your FTP server at ftp._URL_0_, and your gopher server at gopher._URL_0_, etc. This way, just by looking at the full name, anyone can tell what service they're trying to get to.

Well, over time that problem I mentioned earlier got worse and worse as the Internet grew–no one knew how to find anything *except* if it was available through the web service. (If you connect to an FTP site, you do need to know how to navigate the directories to find what you want.) So, it became popular to offer pretty much everything through the web service. As that happened, many companies found that it was redundant now to have all these subdomains, so most just dropped the www subdomain and accessing the domain name just dumps you to the web server. Hence, you can go to www._URL_4_ or _URL_4_ and you get the same thing these days.",eli5

34tq2o,How does DDOS protection work? And why do so many companies (such as eSports tournament organizers) have trouble defending themselves against DDOS? ,"Great question. There are many ways of protecting a server or site from DDOS attacks. DDOS attacks occur when a server is overwhelm with connection request packets, this is much like try to get on a train (the server) but the massive crowd surrounding you blocks your entry. so to prevent this you may use a proxy between the server you wish to protect and the outside world. then using access controls, all external connections are blocked except when coming from the proxy server. because external connections are blocked a ddos becomes ineffective, they may attack the proxy (aka bastion host) but the servers themselves remain safe, then simply swtich proxies.

there are also intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems, these are security layers that come as both software and dedicated hardware. they study the network and watch for signs of malicious activity, things like excessive bandwidth use, sudden spikes, strange new connections that may or may not be legitimate. these systems will react to a ddos attack and begin individually blocking ips that are overwhelming the system with connections. 

you can change other settings in the server, to change the timers that drop connection packets, distribute your service across many servers so they may not all be attacked. or you can hire large corporations with systems designed to be ddos protected, and many of these companies simply have so much bandwidth and a strong counter-measure system to mitigate a ddos as it happens.",eli5

I was just thinking because I poured some olive oil on my food and it tastes so bad, but I eat it anyway because I know it's good. Don't we suppose to crave things that are good for us?","What is 'good' or 'bad' for us is often not determined by what it is but rather by how much. 
From an evolutionary perspective, we crave sugar and fats because this was the most difficult (and thus rare) thing to have, and at the same time, its the thing that contains most energy. Our bodies still 'believe' that this is the case, so we still crave sugar and fats despite its abundance. 

The science of what we should and shouldn't eat is a difficult one, and it doesn't help that every scientific finding or study is then bloated by mass media in articles like ""If you eat xy, you will live longer"" just because some rat experiment showed a marginal effect of a highly concentrated and chemically modified substance that also happens to be in xy. So you will probably find studies suggesting that eating oils in general is bad, and others stating that eating olive oil is better than eating palm fat, whilst others state that not oils but carbohydrates are the problem. 

Then there is taste, and that is often very individual. I for example like olive oil and could eat bread dipped into nothing but olive oil every day.",eli5

1mmm41,"Why do people get pimples in their ears, and why do these types of pimples tend to squirt white puss and blood? I mean ""Why do people get pimples on their ears...?""","A. You can get pimples anywhere you have skin.

B. Pimples in the ear are less likely to be detected than, say, a pimple on your nose, and as such may grow to larger sizes.

C. The skin on the inside of your ear is very sensitive, if you've noticed. This is because this particular area of skin is very thin, also allowing large pimples to form under pressure. 

D. The inside of your ear is like an oil trap of dead skin cells/etc, plenty of opportunity to get a pore blocked and develop a pimple. 

So, the oiliness of the inner ear causes the pimples, while the other qualities of the skin such as the thinness and obscurity of the skin allow pimples to grow larger and under pressure, causing that ""shooting"" and blood you're talking about.",eli5

3n374o,"If space is a vacuum, how come it's so cold? Wouldn't there have to be something there to be cold? What's making it cold?","Unfortunately, space isn't just space. How ""hot"" or ""cold"" it is depends on where you are. It also doesn't help that heat ""moves"" differently in space than it does on earth due to the vacuum.

If you have a thermometer in your house and take it outside, it will warm up or cool down until it reaches the same temperature as everything around it, with ""everything"" mainly being the atmosphere or whatever rock/table/bit of ground you left it lying on. By coming in contact the atmosphere and the ground, the thermometer can easily exchange heat with the environment and will soon give you an accurate reading of the temperature.

Now let us imagine you're on the International Space Station and you do the same thing. You take your thermometer out of the ISS and leave it floating a little bit outside the airlock. Let's say you also did this ""at night"", i.e. when the ISS passes through earth's shadow so that the sun doesn't interfere with your experiment. The thermometer's temperature will barely change. This doesn't mean that the space is the same temperature as the inside of the ISS, it's just that your thermometer can't exchange heat the way it would on earth since it's in a vacuum. It will cool VERY SLOWLY by emitting so-called black body radiation (this is exactly the same as the light that metal gives off when it glows red hot, except that your thermometer is only at room temperature, so it only glows in the infra-red).

Now let's say you wait a little longer. The orbit will carry the thermometer out of earth's shadow into full sunlight. Now, the thermometer is giving off a little bit of IR light (which cools it down slowly very slowly) and absorbs large amounts of light from the sun (which heats it up rapidly). This means that your thermometer floating in space will get HOTTER! And for quite a while, it will continue to get hotter and hotter. However, as it gets hotter, it will emit more and more black body radiation until the radiation it loses is equal to what it gains from the sun. At this point, it will be showing the ""correct"" temperature, which is quite hot for the ISS. After all, when you're in orbit around earth, you receive more light per square meter than if you were sitting in the Sahara desert at mid day.

Finally, let's imagine that you did the same thing from a space ship that was floating in deep space (i.e. well outside of our galaxy). Now the thermometer will lose heat through black body radiation as it did before, but there is no sun to heat it up. The only light it can absorb is the so-called ""cosmic microwave background"", which is the left-over light from the big bang. But otherwise, the situation is the same. The thermometer will continue to lose temperature (and hence will emit less and less black-body radiation) until it is giving off as much as it is receiving from the CMB. This happens at about -270C, which is very cold indeed. This is why people say that space is cold, but it's really only true for deep space.",eli5

hitler, however, was a singular and irrational force of will who forced the entire world to react to him -- on his own. people aren't supposed to be allowed to do that. it is both unpredictable and disturbing to historians and analysts and everyone else involved in making and recording history. on top of this, he irrationally exterminated large swaths of people for *no political gain*. people are much more afraid of, and thus vilify, irrational violence.

* Other countries.  This is a more complicated problem, mainly because it varies from country to country.  So I'm going to take a step back and explain what inflation is:

Inflation is the **devaluation of a specific currency**.  It applies to a *specific currency*, not the world, so there's really no such thing as ""worldwide inflation.""  There is inflation in many of the countries in the world, but even if every country in the world was experiencing 10% inflation, it would be worldwide **only** to the extent that everybody was screwing things up in the same way.

Mostly, inflation reflects a disconnect between the amount of money in country's economy (not how much they print - That's usually a much much smaller number) and how much their economy (GDP is the most common measure) is growing.  If a country was experiencing exactly 5% growth in their GDP and exactly 5% growth in their money supply, they would experience no inflation at all.  *But it never works out that way*.  In reality economic growth always lags a little bit behind the growth in the money supply.

Certain countries (usually petty dictatorships that do stupid stuff with their economy) try, for example, to just **print** a gazillion more dollars or yen or whatever currency.  They figure they can make money by, well, by **literally making** more money.  But the thing is if you double the amount of money in, say, Zimbabwe's economy without actually doubling the amount of goods and services produced (AKA productivity) by that economy, all that happens is that everything you buy in Zimbabwe **now costs twice as much!**

I'm mentioning Zimbabwe because they actually tried to pull this stunt a few years ago.  [Didn't work out too well.](_URL_0_)

Now, you may ask, how do we keep *our* inflation so low when other countries can't, and my answer is the Federal Reserve Board.  The FRB controls the growth of the money supply by controlling interest rates.  It's too complicated to go into here, but basically, the lower the prevailing interest rates, the faster the amount of money in the economy grows because banks make more loans.  But the FRB is very careful to *not* allow the money supply to grow too fast without a commensurate increase in productivity.  And they've been spectacularly successful for the past 30+ years or so at that.  Other countries have other ideas how to control inflation.  I can't really speak to those, though I can point out an awful lot of those countries are [great big](_URL_0_), [shitty messes](_URL_2_), [right now](_URL_1_).",eli5

1jgd37,Why does the USA have so many farm subsidies? ,"420BIF has a good overview, especially his point that the EU also has an extensive agricultural subsidy program. Indeed, most rich nations have programs to protect domestic agriculture. Japan also has large subsidies, Australia and Canada both had ""single desk marketing"" for wheat, and Canada retains several programs that greatly increase the barriers to entry in dairy farming.

Indeed, New Zealand (and post-Wheat Board Australia) are remarkable among rich countries for their relatively laissez-faire policies on agriculture. 

For the USA specifically, there are several important structural reasons why farm subsidies have become so valuable. 

First, American agriculture is incredibly economically important, and is seen as a strategically valuable industry. There are many gigantic agricorps in America, and like any other large corporations, they lobby hard. It probably wouldn't surprise you that Boeing, Microsoft, ExxonMobil have many friends in Congress and often get laws passed which directly benefit them. Agribusiness is playing the same game.

Second, there are specific structural peculiarities to the American Congress which combine to benefit agricultural industries. No law can be enacted without passing both houses. There are exactly 2 Senators from every state, regardless of that state's population. It is hardly a surprising fact that areas with significant agricultural production do not enjoy high population densities. So Nebraska gets equal representation as California, Iowa as New York. Regardless of other considerations, the Senate means that areas where agriculture is big business (and thus likely to have the ear of the Senators) are systematically over-represented in the American Senate.

Third, the recent practice has been to bundle the Farm Subsidies generally more important to Republican Representatives and Senators in the same bill as SNAP/Food Stamps which tend to be a Democratic priority. As this massive bill contains lots of goodies for both parties, it has usually sailed through Congress (until this year).",eli5

When I walk away from the radio I tend to lose most if not all reception.,"First, keep in mind that as a general rule, static is a result of poor reception. This can be caused by distance, or simple interference. The answer to this, barring such modern contrivances as cable radio and the like, is to attach the receiver to a bigger antenna.

So what's this got to do with you touching or coming close to the antenna? Turns out that the human body makes a pretty good one in most cases, being a better conductor than, say, air or your living room wall. As a result, more of the signal is picked up and channeled into your receiver via the antenna, clearing up the reception.",eli5

8jzaae,Why do suction cups stick to stuff? Edit: how does the vaccum seal keep the cup attached to the surface?,"The air pressure outside the space between the suction cup and the surface keeps the cup pressed against the surface. 

The cup is deformed until flat when pressed against the surface. If you attempt to pull the cup off, it will attempt to resume its non-deformed shape as a result. Because there’s no air underneath the cup, and no air can rush into that space, pulling the cup off creates a vacuum underneath it. When you create a vacuum underneath it, the air pressure outside it overwhelms the lack of pressure underneath and prevents the cup from resuming its shape.

When you make a purchase the transaction receives a transaction number, that number has to be confirmed with the bank/credit company.  The company receiving the money could take several days for the purchase to go through.

When you reverse the process through refund, more steps are taken to ensure that not only is the transaction correct, such as what they go through with purchases, that you are not committing fraud in the process, because you cannot provide secured transaction information similar to a store.

The reason why it seems instantly on your transactions is because most banks and credit cards put a hold on the amount of the transactions.",eli5

22m8w7,Why doesn't ALL encryption use a system akin to onion routing? Isn't it logically unbreakable? ,"Even though encryption technology is used as part of the system, onion routing itself isn't about encryption - it's about anonymization. And even if it was a crypto system, there are other crypto algorithms out there that may be better suited for different tasks. 

For example, if I just needed to encrypt a file that I'm storing locally on my computer (aka ""Data at Rest"") then I would want a different algorithm than what onion routers use, because I would want something that's as strong as possible and wouldn't need any fanciness like assymetric keying. 

In another example, let's say I need to do business online with my bank. A big requirement there would be that my crypto scheme needs to authenticate, ie, it needs to be able to prove that the website I'm on truly does belong to my bank and I wasn't redirected to a fake page somehow. That means there needs to be a certificate authority that can vouch for the keys that my bank is using and confirm the bank's identity - the encryption in most onion routing schemes doesn't support this (because again: the point of onion routing is anonymity).",eli5

People will tell you that they don't induce suicidal thoughts, that all they do is give you the energy to act on suicidal thoughts you already have. But that's false.  They've been documented as giving non-depressed people suicidal thoughts as well.

The thing is, we know almost nothing about how/why they alter your mood.  We don't know why they help treat depression - they just do.  We don't know why they have the side effects they do - they just do.

There's also energy-saving technologies out there which help battery life as well.

An old phone draws much less current then all the screens and processors of a modern phone, so I'd wager it's got a much longer battery life. I'll just focus on the actual battery tech.

To put it simply, the only difference between a battery and a bomb is how quickly the energy is released. As you go to higher and higher energy substrates, it becomes more difficult to keep packing in chemical potential.

We've pretty much reached the limit with standard Li-ion batteries; a certain mass of lithium can only hold so much energy. There's promise with thin film technology where the battery would essentially be printed on, to improve how much battery we could fit into a device

There's other non-battery devices which we could use, like fuel cells and ultracapacitors. But for the moment, battery technology has reached the physical limit of lithium's redox potential.",eli5

8ffozm,Why do some fire alarms rattle/buzz your ears? ,"The effect is called sensory dissonance.  When you play two different tones that are close to, but not exactly the same, as each other the peaks and valleys of the waves cross over and interfere with each other.  At certain points the valley of one synchronizes with the peak of the other, and they partially cancel each other out, but at other points the valleys and peaks meet up and amplify the overall sound.

In those times just before and just after the peaks and valleys, or peaks and peaks meet, they are producing vibrations that are difficult for your inner ears to discern from each other, because your ear parts cannot vibrate clearly at two different frequencies that are so close to each other at the same time.  This results in the buzzing sound that seems to come from within your own head as your inner ears are temporarily overloaded with competing vibrations.  

Dissonance is used a lot in Western music to create melodic tension.  It's a combination of notes that feels uncomfortable and needs resolution.  In that setting it can be pleasing, but in the case of a fire alarm, the obnoxious volume level and continuous dissonance is meant to be something you can't ignore and want to get away from.",eli5

China gives 20$ to USA, with the condition that the USA pays back 25$ in 10 years. That is called a bond.  
  
Japan gives USA 30$ with the condition that the USA pays back 40$ in 10 years.  
  
So now the USA has a national debt of 65$.  
  
In 10 years, we pay back the 65$ we owe China and Japan. Where do we get that money? Most likely from issuing a bond to the UK. When we need to pay that back? We borrow money from China again. We don't need to print money and cause inflation because we can just borrow more.  
  
Why can we do this? Because the USA *always* pays back it's debt. A US treasury bond is the safest investment you could possibly make (as in, you're guaranteed to get what you expected). There will *always* be somebody who needs to stash away some money for a while, so there will always be a buyer for debt.",eli5

Note that in this case, reinstalling means that you back up your data, wipe the PC's hard disk, reinstall Windows, reinstall all your programs, and restore your data.  That WILL speed things up again.  Nothing else will.

However, you can speed up Windows a lot by uninstalling any programs you don't use.  Also, disable disk indexing if you don't use the search feature.  And don't use a modern internet security suite unless your PC is up to the job - try with the basic Windows Defender instead.

What happened?","Let's say your body is a huge factory that does things (in this case - lifting a battery). Your consciousness is the boss that decides what the factory actually does and how. Your muscles are regular workers, who actually do stuff according to boss's orders. They would not know what to do without him. But suddenly the conveyor belt starts heating up and risks to catch on fire. When workers see it, they won't go to the boss and ask for permission to stop working and fix the problem. First of all, they will stop the production (this is what happened with you) so nothing gets seriously damaged. Once everything is back to normal, a good boss would look into the situation, figure out what happened and try to prevent such situations.

28uils,"How would half the gravity on Earth, and in another scenario double the gravity on Earth affect us in everyday life? Also, could we survive without any gravity at all? Let's say Earth had the gravity of Mars (38% of Earth's) and in another scenario had the gravity of Jupiter (2 1/2 times that of Earth's). How would this affect us in everyday life?  
What if there was no Gravity on Earth, could we survive? What would be different?  
I got turned down in /askscience so maybe I can get an explanation here.","Not exactly an expert, but I'm an undergraduate Physics major:

Assuming that Earth has ALWAYS had the gravitational attraction of Mars or Jupiter, it would affect us very little. Our bodies would have evolved along with all other life on Earth to match whatever the gravitation of Earth is. However, if Earth's gravitation were to suddenly ""change"" to that of Mars or Jupiter, things get a bit more complicated. 

Let's talk about the ""general physics"" of it first. Most people on Earth have a general concept of physics that applies to everyday life. We know things like how high we can jump, how close we can get to another car before we start braking, etc. As soon as you change the Earth's gravitation, those basic previous expectations about how things move in our everyday lives has to be thrown out the window. As a result, depending on how extreme the change is, there would be a lot of crashes, a lot of bumps, and a lot of bruises as we adjusted to the new ""rules.""
 
Physiologically, there would be serious consequences to an extreme change in gravity. We run into this problem a lot with astronauts returning from long stays in zero gravity. Our bodies simply aren't built to be under gravitation that is not Earth's. People returning from space experience a lengthening of the spine, weakening of joints, and a huge loss in calcium. Basically, when placed in a zero-g environment, our body will try to adapt accordingly. If we don't use our bones and are floating around, our bodies will basically begin to get rid our bones. Now for us to be on the surface of Earth at all, there has to be at least a little gravity so we don't float away. Therefore, if gravity on Earth was reduced but not eliminated, people would get taller and we would have less calcium. Now the opposite would happen if gravitational attraction increased. People would be shorter, breathing would be harder, we would rely on our skeletons more so we would require more calcium, etc. Long term, humanity would adjust, but short term, there would be a lot of problems for a lot of people, especially the weak and elderly. 

Now I'm not sure exactly what would happen on the astronomical scale, but there would be even more serious consequences which would effect our daily lives. Gravitational attraction is a force between two objects. On the very basic level, gravitation depends on the masses of the two objects involved. (Mass is basically just a measure of how much stuff there is) More mass between the two = more gravity. Less mass between the two = less gravity. The situations that you have described deal with a change in mass of the Earth. If the Earth were suddenly half of it's mass, the Moon would begin to orbit further away, that is, as long as it wasn't ""slingshotted"" away (more likely). Also, we would begin to orbit the Sun further away, as long as we weren't ""slingshot"" out of the solar system (also more likely). Living further away from the Sun would cause widespread panic as our light from the Sun would diminish quite a bit. Plants and animals would die, famines if everyone wasn't frozen already, etc. etc. you get the picture. REALLY BAD STUFF. If the Earth doubled it's mass, the Earth and the moon would also most likely be ""slingshotted"" out of the solar system. But, if we managed to stay in orbit, our proximity to the sun would most likely burn most life on Earth. 

**TL;DR**: 
Overall - Our basic concepts about how things move in everyday life would change...Lots of crashes, bumps and bruises.

1. No Gravity - We would all float away from the surface of the Earth.
2. Half Gravity - We would all get taller, breathe easier, and have weaker skeletons because we wouldn't need them as much. The Earth would likely be ""slingshotted"" out of the solar system, or we would all freeze to death.
3. Double Gravity - We would all get shorter, breathe harder, and have stronger skeletons. The Earth would likely be ""slingshotted"" out of the solar system, or we would all burn alive.",eli5

So during an eclipse, there's less total light, however any visible portion of the sun is just as bright as it is usually, which is bright enough to physically damage your eyes.

Thus, your iris will accomodate by expanding, allowing even more light than usual in, when the light is already intense enough to cause harm normally.",eli5

I've noticed that every hospital that I've seen, even ones in Mexico, they all have a big red sign on the hospital and the direction list saying 'EMERGENCY' in big lettering and everything. 

Edit: okay, I get that they're easy to see and some other countries may have different colors but I'm asking why do they particularly associate the color red to the word ""emergency"", like even ""ambulance entrance"" is in red and shouldn't the paramedics already know where to go anyways?  ","The simple answer is that it's a standard. Sometimes standards don't necessarily have a specific reason for why they're one way and not another way, but the most important thing is that they're consistent so people can know what to expect no matter where they are.

Red is an eye-catching color and is used for many emergency purposes. It makes sense that it be used for emergency room signage. I've never built a full-fledged hospital (and I'm on mobile right now) so I'm not sure where you can find hospital standards, but I'd bet money that there is a specific national standard for hospital signage including colors, language, size, and placement,  and that those standards are adopted into state and local building codes nationwide.

I'm currently 17 and have always accepted climate change and have never really thought about why people deny it.","It's a very complex bit of science, that requires a background in climate science to truly grasp the studies that prove man made climate change.

Basically, the Earth has been warming and cooling for its whole history, so it's not just enough to show that the world is warming up, as that could be completely natural. You have to show that it's heating up faster than it should be, which involves looking at hundreds of thousands of years worth of climate data, gathered from multiple partial sources, like tree rings, ice cores, and geologic samples. You also need to account for other man made events, such as the heat island effects of cites, and adjust the data accordingly.

So you've got a very complex science, with plenty of places to manipulate the data, either accidentally or intentionally. Combine that with the idea that it's presumably easier to get funding for more research if your data proves climate change, and you can see why someone might be a little sceptical. 

Combine all of the above with a general distrust of the left, and you can see why someone might just discredit the entire argument for climate change on the idea that it's just a conspiracy cooked up by the left to shut down oil companies and the like.",eli5

Most students won't need to take anything from the pool since they also bring enough of their own food but sometimes if a parent is too busy to pack lunch or forget to give them lunch money, at least there is something for that student to eat without having a gurgling stomach through the day.

But there are some students that seem always hungry. One student, Johnny, is a bit bigger in both dimensions compared to the other students and gets hungry quite easily. He typically takes more food from the communal pool than the amount he contributes.

Some of the other students are annoyed. They think that because of Johnny's choice to eat more food and become large, he ended up with a big appetite. If he has to eat so much, he should be more self-sufficient and not rely on the communal pool of food because of his own choices. Why do the rest of the students have to pay for Johnny's choices?

When I see them on screen, even on nature documentaries, I get a phantom sensation of a bug crawling along some part of my body which freaks me out. I'm also completely terrified of needles, and if I see one on screen going into somebody's arm, I also get a painful, stinging sensation of it going into my arm as well. What causes the brain to imagine these types of stimuli? Why does it do this?","Since fear is such a strong emotion, your brain responds very heavily to it. When the brain sees a spider, it automatically pulls up all the ""data"" on spider experiences, which could stimulate the feeling of one. I've heard that we have these experiences as an instinct to avoid harmful situations. Evolution has selected for brains that process fears this way to help us avoid getting bit by a snake, stung by a bee, etc. All this ""info"" in your brain is just patterns of electrical signals: the stronger the pattern the stronger the signal. Snakes and bees are innate fears (for most people) probably because they've always been harmful to humans. I'd say needles are a learned fear since they haven't been around long (in terms of evolution time). A baby/toddler won't cry at a needle until he/she is poked with one.",eli5

2s7twr,"Why do accents exist? What causes people in certain regions to speak a certain way? Now, I'm sure it is just a social thing but what caused it in the first place?","A big thing to keep in mind is that many accents developed before literacy was as widespread as it is now. When you don't anchor a language to its written form, it mutates a lot faster than it would otherwise.

For example, if you don't know how to read or write, but you live in a town that frequently has French people coming by, when you ask a Frenchman what that thing is that he's carrying, he's going to tell you the French word for it. If you don't know how to spell it in English, you're going to pronounce it in a manner similar to how the French man pronounced it. Pass down that pronunciation for a few generations, then when your grandchildren's grandchildren learn to read, they're already going to have heard it pronounced the French way, so they're going to link that pronunciation to the English spelling.

Now imagine that you take a group of people from your town and send them off on a magical quest to colonize a new area. Say they encounter Germans, who have the same item as the French people. You learn to pronounce it the German way, while the other people speaking the same language are pronouncing it closer to the French way.

And you're also going to get people who will get a word from a new language and try to pronounce it with the rules of their own language.

Now say your brother who can read writes a letter to your cousin who lives far away, and is trying to describe this crazy new thing the French people are carrying with them. He does his best to spell it, but has never seen it written, so he writes it using the English rules he knows, which will probably be different from the way the French people spell it. Then your cousin sees this weird spelling and does the best he can with it, but because you don't have phones he doesn't know how you pronounce it. He introduces the idea of that new object to his village, and they follow his pronunciation on it.

1n6134,Why is the human heart found on the left side of the body? ,"It's due to morphogenetic factors.  These are molecules distributed unequally throughout the embryo as the body is forming.  As body tissues form, these morphogenetic factors influence how development occurs by telling cells what to do next.  There are lots of these factors used during development, though PITX2 is the name is probably the most recognizable name related to heart-folding.  

When the heart develops, it starts as just a tube.  Thanks to morphogenetic factors, this tube bulges to the side and twists.  This movement eventually leads to the formation of a [loop](_URL_0_).  (If you're unclear on how twisting leads to a loop, get a string or a shoelace and grab it with some space between your hands.  Twist with one hand and bring your hands closer together.  A loop will form.)  

After this, some more development happens, but the heart is already not perfectly even.  Eventually the left side grows larger because it is responsible for pushing the blood the furthest through the body.  This is tough work and as you know, exercise leads to muscle growth.  As a result, since the left side is working harder, it grows larger.",eli5

Analysts thought there was a pretty good market for roughly 200-300 stores for videos for many years to come, they were probably right. It was a surprise they just shut  them down, especially for stores in places that were still quite profitable.

But the new owners of Blockbuster, DISH Network (the satellite TV service), just decided to get out of the video rental business altogether.

Hormones are produced in our bodies at different times of the day, based on circadian rhythm and based on the situation (like, if you just ate an enormous meal, you will have less appetite-stimulating hormone around in your blood). 

Appetite hormones are suppressed in the night. Those hormones start circulating in your blood again in the morning. 

Some people wake up starving. Other people, like you (and me) need to wait some time before feeling hungry at all. This probably has to do with how much of the hormone is present in the blood.

This also separately happens in the human visual system (which you have noticed!), and we're not entirely sure why.

5ym6bv,"Why were wars like the American Civil War and the American Revolution fought using Volley Fire and not guerilla warfare? Wouldn't it have resulted in less casualties if all soldiers weren't lined up like sitting ducks? I've always had a hard time grasping why exactly volley fire is even a thing. You're pretty much a sitting duck and if someone was to ambush you, you'd be dead.","I can't believe the answers you're getting.  It's all in the physics, not about honor at all.

Up until the civil war most soldiers used muskets. Muskets were smoothbore guns which had a practical range of a hundred yards at most.  Most of the time they were fired at a range of fifty yards because they were so inaccurate.  They were not designed to be aimed.  It took massed ranked fire to produce real effects from that kind of weapon. So soldiers lined up shoulder to shoulder, and everybody aimed in the general direction of the enemy and fired upon command.  It was considered more important to fire all at once than to fire with accuracy with muskets for the shock effect.  Add to that the generally short range of voice and musical instruments used to command soldiers back then and you wanted tightly grouped ranks of men.  Add to that the fact that most musket volleys were backed up by the bayonet charge to break the enemy, again by massed ranks of men, and you wanted your guys held together for mutual cohesion and support. Some troops were issued rifles but they were specialists. And some troops shook out into open formation but they were a tiny part of the formation known as skirmishers who were intended to prevent the enemy quickly overrunning your main formation.  When lines of battle formed they quickly moved into the main line as regular troops.  There are other reasons but within the scope of ELI5 this is good enough.  Basically, the guns used demanded close rank formations.


It wasn't until the civil war when the rifle was adopted by rank and file that formations opened up, and even then it took a while to adopt new ways of command and movement that allowed troops to work in open file as a general thing. Pretty much all the way through the Civil War rifles were still used in large massed formations to blast away at each other at close range.  Mostly it wasn't until the Indian Wars that troops adopted open ranks with their repeating cartridge rifles.


You are right, by the way, that guys hiding behind trees and rocks and sniping at ranked units (or attacking from the woods) could be deadly.  The militia in the American War for Independence hammered British troops in formation by fighting this way, until the British could stand in the open and blast away at them.  Fighting in formation like this has distinct advantages, but also distinct weaknesses.  In the fRench and Indian Wars, the French and Indians favorite technique was the catch British columns in the woods and bushwhack them.",eli5

47zhdh,"How did distinctive body features form as different races developed? What caused certain people to have straight or curly hair and what color it would be? And how did varying nose, lips, and eye shapes come about? 
I think it has something to do with the environment, but I'm still a little lost. ","Within every population, there is always variation. This is key to understanding how all of this happened. 

As humans migrated around the planet, some differences between local groups were due to the [founder effect](_URL_0_), where the founding population of humans in a given area didn't have the same percentages of each characteristic as the general human population. 

Some differences, such as skin colour, are largely due to climate. Dark skin pigmentation is like natural sunscreen, but it impedes your body's ability to synthesize vitamin D using sunlight. In really sunny areas, this isn't a big deal, but in places where it isn't as sunny, it is. People who, due to natural variation, had slightly lighter skin were more likely to pass on their genes in less sunny parts of the world. 

When it comes to things like eye colour, hair colour, hair texture, lip shape, and eye shapes, it's not as well known for sure. It could even be that some traits, like straight hair or a certain eye shape, were considered culturally more attractive, and that's why people with those traits had more surviving offspring than in other parts of the world.",eli5

3fazlt,How does the magnus effect work? ,"It's to do with what's called the boundary layer. Friction with the surface of the object creates a thin layer of air that ""sticks"" to the object - having very little motion relative to the object. Outside of this thin layer, the air flows smoothly around the object.

If the object isn't particularly streamlined (as is the case with a spherical ball), then behind the object this boundary layer seperates from the object, resulting in a turbulent region of air behind the object. This is a major source of drag on the object.

If the object is rotating, the boundary layer on one side seperates from the object slightly later than it does on the other side - so the air on one side continues following the curvature of the ball for a little while longer.

The result is that the airflow is deflected around the ball, and by Newton's third law, this exerts a reaction force on the ball.",eli5

554v8m,"Why is the word feminist used to describe gender equality in all aspects? The term in itself seems to favor one gender over the other.... Before you accuse me of ""bashing"" something try to understand my thought process and true curiosity.

Feminism = means gender equality (?), from what I understand.

Feminism = sounds like only females are involved or allowed to be involved but is definitely not the case 

Malism (sp?) = would never fly ....

So why not Equalism or something ""gender neutral"" ? ","The argument is that the inequality is most unfavorable to women. If we are to make things equal for all sexes and genders, if we help women become equal to men, then they are equal, which does not require tearing men down or helping women at the expense of men, but bringing women up to that level of equality.

To be clear, feminism *is* mostly concerned with the inequalities that women face. A feminist is not, by definition, interested in making the world better for men, or for the LGBTQ. In fact, many feminist organizations have been criticized for their poor *intersectionality*, which is the concept of the overlap of causes within different groups. For example, a disabled woman wrote an article where she went to a feminist meeting and spoke in the group about the hardships of being a disabled *woman*, but the group was upset that she ""tried to take away the focus on women and make it about disability"".

Intersectionality is a problem that just about all causes face. The gay/lesbian community, for example, can sometimes be very hostile to those who are bi or trans. The problem is that often people think of making the world better as zero sum: that if you want the lives of women to be better, you must necessarily care less about men, or LGBTQ, or whomever. This is not the case, one can be both a feminist and an LGBTQ ally.

Regardless, feminists by definition want equality between the sexes. They do not necessarily want the lives of women to be better than those of men. I qualified that with ""necessarily"" because I think if you asked anyone who isn't a racist, sexist, bigoted person they would agree that there's no reason to stop making the world a better place just because everyone is equal if we're all equally shitty. If a feminist can make life better for women, as long as it isn't at the expense of others, why wouldn't you? That doesn't mean the lives of men or other groups gets worse, it just gives them a new upward goal. A feminist just wants the lives of women to be better, not to be *better than men* - it's not a competition.

Feminists also recognize that a good chunk of problems in society that men face are solved by the inequality that women face. For example, the ""Men's Rights Activists"" will argue that it's unfair that men are expected to provide for the household while women get to sit at home - there's more pressure on men to perform. Feminists agree! That isn't fair! A great solution would be to encourage women to be a more active part of the work force and ensure equal pay and other necessities like maternal leave. That way, women will be *capable* of sharing the burden of providing for the household. Feminists argue that women don't generally *want* to be confined to the home and would gladly contribute. So the problem that the MRAs want solved is also one that feminists want solved.

To be fair, there are shitty feminists out there who do hate men in general and don't care about helping them. Also to be fair, there are shitty Christians like the Westboro Baptist Church, there are shitty Muslims like ISIS, there are shitty atheists like Richard Dawkins, there are shitty gays and shitty lesbians, there are shitty disabled people, there are shitty white people, there are shitty black people, there are shitty people of every race, creed, religion, whatever. Those people do not necessarily represent the movement they claim to be a part of so although shitty feminists exist who do not conform to this definition, they are the shitty minority attaching themselves unwanted to the word, not the norm.

The shortest way to say it is that feminism is concerned with advancing causes associated with women, but not exclusively and not to the detriment of men. There absolutely are men and organizations of men that advance the causes associated with men: however, since most of the inequality comes from the advantages men continue to have over women in society, it's tricky to support men in a way that does not continue to hold women back in society, and most men who really do actually want equality recognize that being a feminist helps everybody.

548kob,"Why is the gold standard touted as being real money and fiat currency as fake? Basically, both of these things (paper vs a metal) have no inherent value. For example, a currency based on food or water would seem like a better store of currency because those things actually have real life value. Is the only difference between the two that you can only mine a finite amount of gold thus controlling supply?","I think lack of understanding of economics, and being generally unfamiliar with world history contributes to this belief.  People have been using various types of metals, stones, and even pebbles as currency.   The reason currency backed by gold is touted as supreme currency, is due to its rarity, and a false perception of relative stability.  There many downsides to gold standard as currency, I will list a few here, but not necessarily in the order of importance.

 * Gold generally increases in value, which means your currency suffers deflation.  Deflation as a rule is much worse than inflation as it hampers growth.  At high level of deflation, you no longer need to risk your money, to increase your purchase power, you just need to wait, thus taking away from the economy.  Now imagine you have a mortgage, in an inflationary environment, your house increases in price, but your payment stays the same, and lower in real world terms.  With deflation, your house is worth less, but your payment stays the same, think 2008 economic crisis.
 * Gold value is not so stable as it seems, in the past 50 years it both rose from 400 to 1800, and went back to 400 and back to 1800 again when adjusted for inflation.  
_URL_0_ 
 * Rapid infusion of gold is unhealthy to the economy, and can hamper economic growth for centuries.  Very interesting article on effect on Spain from all the Inca gold, I think it increased supply of gold in Europe several times.  
_URL_1_
 * The main reason modern economies went to fiat currencies, is they provide tools to control the economy, i.e increase/decrease money supply.  Unlike gold, you can actually print more money if economy needs it.  It took the fed (i.e. economists at central bank) 60+ years get better at stimulating economy, while keeping hyperinflation at bay, with mediocre results, but better than before.  Prior to 19th century, rate of growth of 1% would be superb, 0.1-0.2% would be normal, hence the prices didn't change much.  Authors would reference price of something, and 30 years later the price seemed reasonable.  In the 19th century, they've stopped doing that, as it didn't age well:).  
 * Currency based on food and water suffer the same fate as currencies based on paper.  In the past 50 years food became a lot cheaper to produce.  The yields on corn, wheat, and pretty much any fruits/veggies increased dramatically.  You would prolly need to work 3-4 times less number of hours to feed your family today than 50 years ago. If you need to increase the money supply, do you grow extra food that will just rot away?  Even if you can conserve it, can you do that for decades?
 * Among other arguments, fiat currency existed since the advent of banking system or IOUs, but that's a bit more involved to explain.",eli5

22kgy9,"Why is the PT cruiser ""a bad car""? There's a [thread](_URL_0_) at the top of the front page that's dedicated to talking about how terrible they are. I really know nothing about cars, so some explanation of peoples' opinions would be very nice.","Chrysler has a rather bad reputation to begin with, especially in regards to reliability and quality, for starters.  The main issue was just the fact that so many people consider it to be one of the ugliest cars on the planet.  It was largely unchanged for almost nine years.  It was classified as a truck for CAFE standards.  Lastly it got poor gas mileage.  But ultimately, it was just really ugly, served no purpose and would quite likely break down on you.    

Some information I thought of after my initial post.  One major factor was this was around the same time that car manufacturers started toying with the retro idea, such as the mustang and Ford Gt, which looked great.  While this one was ugly and awkward, more like the Thunderbird, which quickly ended production, but Chrysler kept making Pt's.

The plastic wood paneling just looked absolutely ridiculous on these cars, which further reinforced the lack of cool factor.  

They weren't fast, and somewhat limited hauling but returned poor gas mileage.

I think the major question was who in the hell would buy this thing?  It is classified as a compact and why buy this instead of a Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla or Ford Focus?  It just pales drastically in comparison.  This problem was further exacerbated when a convertible version was made, which further made people say who the hell would want to be seen cruising down the road in this piece of junk.  

This is my opinion on the car, and may not be completely fair, but I imagine it is the opinion held by the majority of people that carry even the slightest of opinions on cars.

8vje3h,Why does it take long for powdered beverage like bornvita to dissolve in hot water compared to when poured in cold water?,"The warm water have more energy. The molecules in the powder are held together with relatively weak intermolecular forces. To break the bonds you need energy.

So the fact that there are more energy in the warm water result in that the bonds can break at a higher rate so it dissolve faster.

In water you can only dissolve a limited amount of a chemical. So the water close to the sugar will in a short time be saturated with sugar. 
So sugar have to spread out in the surrounding water to dissolve more sugar.  If you stir the water the powered will solved faster as you move the saturated water away. Molecules move faster in warm water so the sugar will spread out faster then in cold water

The speed it dissolve depend of how close it is to saturation.

A final reson is that for many chemicals you can dissolve more in hot the ion cold water so the water close the the powder can dissolve more  sugar.


You show that at home without any problem.

Have 2 identical glasses with the same amount of water att the same temperature and measure is with a termometer. Put a lot of salt in a glass and stir it and you will notice that the temperature drop compared to the other glas.

The second experiment is to again have 2 identical glasses with the same amount of water att the same temperature. Put the same amount of sugar in both and stir one and compare the how fast the sugar dissolve.

The third experiment is a single glas or another container with hot water. Pour sugar in it stir it and add more sugar until you no more get dissolve. Let it cool and notice that there is a lot more sugar at the bottom. Use relative little sugar because you can dissolve close  to 500g of sugar in 1 dl of water. At room temperature is is close to 200g

If you tried the last experiment with salt you would notice less difference as you can dissolve 35g at room temperature in 1dL and it increase to 40g at the boiling point. So sugar for sugar is is 150% more at boiling point but only 14% more for slat.",eli5

oulnn,"How did Mitt Romney get his wealth? Also, his controversial doings at Bain Capital - what exactly did he allegedly do wrong? ","Imagine you're running a popsicle stand with your friends. You are doing okay, but one day it turns out your stand isn't making money, and your friends aren't happy. Then another kid with a bunch of money comes along and says 'Let me buy your popsicle stand, I am good at running them, and I will turn it around, and your friends will be happy, I won't pay you much since you aren't doing well, but at least you're getting something.' So now the rich kid owns the stand and starts tyring to make it more efficient by firing some of your friends, since he didn't think they were necessary. He streamlines the stand, making it more profitable. If your stand recovers and ends up stronger than before, then the rich kid makes money because he owns it. If it looks like it will keep failing, he lets it fail in order to take in tax benefits and sill try to salvage some profit. That is in a veeeerrry basic nutshell what Bain Capital does. Romney is getting attacked for firing people when really, that was his job: to streamline companies to try to help them recover. But even though a lot of them didn't, he still made a boatload of cash by making them take out loans and getting tax breaks. Nothing he did was illegal, in fact it is exactly what capitalism does, but because his work cost people jobs it is a big political point agaisnt him.

* African borders were defined by Europeans with little/no consideration to the ethnic groups. This results in countries with many different tribal groups with different cultures and languages. This will naturally make the country harder to administer, and is more likely to create separatist groups and ill-feeling between groups.
* Often, one particular ethnic group would be chosen by the Europeans to be in charge of each particular territory. These groups have maintained their dominance of government since independence, meaning that people from other ethnicities are going to be more likely to feel disillusioned and start uprisings etc.
* Europeans extracted certain resources and commodities from Africa, and all infrastructure was built to facilitate this extraction (e.g. rail lines just go from the mines to the ports, not between commercial centres). Thus, a lot of countries still depend largely one particular export (like diamonds or rubber) and find it hard to diversify. If the demand or price for this export decreases, the economy drops. Unstable economies result in unstable countries.",eli5

germany, as the US, has a debt ceiling. i dont get the point of this, its just an arbitrary number, that, once reached, gets into the news, until politicians decide to raise the ceiling, while no one gives a shit about limiting debt expenses.
so, how the hell does this work, why do nations become essential to the world and stock market, while they are fucking deeply in debt?","Well, you have zero passable answers thus far, so I'll respond: 

Up front, I just want you to know that I am for sustainable, short term debt-spending, but not wildly illogical running deficit spending.  Running a deficit over time begins to become unsustainable as the costs begin to rise too high.  

----

Back to your question: Governing officials have two options; operate only on the revenue they receive from taxes and do not exceed that level of spending, or, sell debt instruments to people and other governments and owe money.  I won't get into what a security is, because it isn't relevant at the moment.  

What is relevant is that operating off of debt means that you can invest in infrastructure now and have a higher operating budget in the future to pay off the costs of having that money.  

To illustrate: 

Lets say there is 100,000 in tax revenue coming in per year but the governing officials want to build some government building which will increase services to the people (say a police station, or whatever).  This building costs 110,000.  You only have 100,000 so you cannot do it; so what you do is you sell a certificate which says to the owner ""the government will pay you 10,000 plus interest.""  

So the buyer of that T-Bill gets more than his investment, and reliably, too, and the government gets to build its building, now; so win-win.  

But this is the problem, we are no longer taking out new debt to build buildings and perform investments... **we are now taking out debt to pay off older debt...**

----

To get back, again, to your real question, the *real* answer is moral hazard.  The governing officials have made the inevitable mistake of mishandling tax revenue and mishandling the affairs of government.  It isn't their money, they aren't personally responsible for what happens to it, they waste it and graft some and there is nothing we can do about it (the citizens of US and Germany et al).  

----

So, in short, governing officials took out debt to invest in our future; they mishandled that, didn't invest properly, and now the payments on that debt are so high that we must take out more debt to pay it off.",eli5

She doesn't ask a question and do research on both sides to answer her question; she draws a conclusion and finds research that backs up her opinion. She doesn't give validity to opposing arguments and looks at her topics at a very surface level.

My biggest problem with her though is how she seems to lie a lot.  She claims to be a gamer to some people, but to others she says she doesn't play them at all.  She attacks game industries by stereotyping games women play, but then says women don't want to play FPS games, or violent games (which I know plenty of women that do).  Her kickstarter generated a lot of money, and, from what I see, she has failed to live up to what she promised.  I think she raised $150,000+ for a series of videos she did not complete.  I could be wrong, I have checked for a long time.  In any case, she has the production value of any average youtube blogger. She takes from people and doesn't give credit.

4u12ic,Why do humans look and feel horrible immediately after waking up?,"All of nature sleeps in cycles. Early humans likely slept following their evening meals, shortly after nightfall, and woke when the sun rose. They also picked up the habit of drifting in and out of sleep, which allowed them to stay somewhat alert even during long periods of unconsciousness, a habit passed along to many people today (those you might call ""light sleepers""). Before society, there were no schedules - people slept when they were tired and woke when they woke. 

Today, in ""civilised"" society, we have what I largely consider to be a ridiculous habit: picking a time at night, doing whatever one feels like until that time, and then forcing oneself to become unconscious for a very specific amount of time (e.g., until an alarm goes off). That is a large part of the reason why we feel terrible when we wake up - we're not allowing our bodies to tell us when they have fully rested from the previous day's activities.

The looking part is twofold, I think. One, humans tend to both sweat and shift a few times throughout the night, which is why ""bedhead"" is a thing. Two, humans are compulsive groomers, like most primates, and when we sleep, we can't monitor our appearances, and therefore groom ourselves. Coupled with the fact that we often wake up exhausted, we tend to look much more disarrayed than at any other time.",eli5

This reduces the tear's ability to lubricate and coat the exposed portions of your eye while they are open, causing those surfaces to be in direct contact with air and burn like an open wound. If this continues for too long, it can cause inflammation of the eye or infection both of which could affect your eyesight.

Sleeping gives time for your tear ducts to recover since your eyes are closed. When you wake up after a full night's rest, you can produce good quality tears again.

Before Star Wars, Scifi in movies was very pulpy and bad.

It was proof that it could be done well.

It also has a lot of cultural significance beyond that. Since the success of Star Wars really was the moment when the 'summer blockbuster' aimed at the 15-20 male market became a thing.

Also it just has a very traditional fantasy arch. Which many people find appealing, especially when looking for an 'escape' in media.",eli5

Edit: But it's not entirely silly to think that ideas and memories are connected.

The database where we store our language is shaped like a network: A big, chaotic cobweb of connections between nodes. The nodes are words, concepts, images and a bunch of other things.

When you think of a concept, for example the concept ""a pen"", your brain starts searching for the right word to express it. It sends a signal, which travels along the different connections that lead from the concept to the word (or from node A to node B). There are toooons of connections (strings between the ""nodes), such as how the word looks, what it sounds like, the emotional state you were in when you learned to spell it, things it look like or sound like, things that are opposed and many other connections (pretty much anything you can think of). To save time your brain sends a signal down as many strings as possible. Usually, this works perfectly! It's the reason we manage to process and articulate ~3 words a second when speaking*. But some times things go wrong:

A lot of the connections are shared with other words. Maybe one signal doesn't lead to the right word, but a word that looks like, or sounds like the one you're looking for. Another one might lead to a close relative in meaning; you know it's not the right one, but you know that it's close. This happens because of the chaotic nature of our word database (called mental lexicon, if you want to read more about it).

*Have you ever considered how impressive this is? Not only do we find the right words to express the right concepts: We also apply the proper grammar and structure them into a sentence, at an insane speed.

Edit: As a disclaimer, I'm writing about this in my masters thesis, and I'm not going to be so arrogant as to say that I've understood it completely.",eli5

Now, when you scoop up a shovel full of sand, it's easy, but then when you take out the ice cream and put it back in, those grains melt a little and then re-freeze into something like pebbles.

* migratory animals, ranging from butterflies to whales, use the earth's magnetic field as a directional guide. So do ants.

* pulsars, which emit beacons of high-intensity light over billions of light years, generate their focused beams with magnetic fields.

Man-made:

* almost every electric motor ever made uses magnetic fields.

7cx467,"Why does a Q-tip in your ear feel so good, and why is it bad to do it?","Not to be mean, but this is an easily Googled question.  Still a good question nonetheless!

Why does it feel good?  That is because the ear and the ear canal are erogenous zones filled with nerve endings, notably the Vagus Nerve, which runs from your brain to your butt can be activated via the ear.  The sensation is somewhat amplified by the fact that unlike a regular itch or easily accessible erogenous zone, the inside of your ear is relatively neglected so you tend to remember the sensation more often when you do clean your ears.

Why is it bad to do it?

This really depends on your race.  If you are non-Asian/Native Amerian, you likely have a wet form of ear wax that is yellow and sticky so you risk compacting it.  If you are Asian/Native American, then congratulations, you have dry, mostly white ear wax that *can* be extracted via an ear spoon.

However, insertion of any object into the ear is dangerous especially when done by yourself because you risk damaging the canal, ear drum, and starting an infection.  The greatest risk isn't so much perforation of the ear drum, but rather more importantly, damage to the small, intricate bones of the middle and inner ear (hammer, anvil, etc.) without actually perforating the ear drum.

In general, it is ""bad"" to do it because the risks do not outweigh the benefits.  For the vast majority of people regardless of race, there is simply no need to attempt to remove earwax since it serves the express purpose of protecting your ear canal.  Excess earwax can be removed by medical professions using a variety of less risky methods.

Still, the sensation of digging around in your ears is something that is completely different than any other sensation.  This is again because there are nerve endings in the ear and why it feels so damn good.",eli5

I watched Gattacca, a movie from '97, and Forrest Gump, released in '94, and the sound of both films could've been right out of a modern film. But turn the clock back just a few years and movies have this weird quality to them that lacks midrange, full of tinny or bassy notes only. The same goes for music - I was listening to Lisa Loeb's ""Stay"" and it sounded extremely modern, while something of an approximately similar genre with similar instruments might sound oddly compressed. I'm not just talking about the style of audio engineering back then either, when they applied funky reverb to drum kits, since voice tracks and vocals have the same quality,","I believe this is a result of the switch from analog to digital and I think it became noticeable maybe as early as '83, because if you compare the audio of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, even with only 3 years between them, Jedi has a much richer sound. I think they're decent films to compare, since so many sounds and pieces of music are shared across them. While researching this answer, I found out that the first compact discs were created in like '82, so I think this supports the [gradual] switch from analog to digital recording starting around this time.

I'm still looking for more specific info about what exactly changed in recording and audio mastering technology between the 70s and 80s, but it's weirdly hard to find clear information on Google about this.

2fsstg,How does inflation work and why does it happen? ,"Imagine if everything the average person bought in a year could be put in a massive basket. Suppose that 1 in 10 people bought a house every year then the basket would contain a tenth of a house. 

Inflation is calculated by the change in price of this basket. 

The simplest cause of inflation is that the government has printed more money. Things that are more common are worth less so everything else is comparatively more expensive.

Another factor is how eager people are to buy things. If everyone is scared of losing their job they would spend less. Companies would try to  lower the price of things to sell more to these scared people. If everyone is confident then they're willing to buy things. Companies would increase prices to get an easy profit.

If banks are easy going on loans then people can easily get money to buy houses which increases the price of houses. If banks are strict on loans then fewer people have the money to buy houses so the price of houses decreases.

All these factors affect the price of your shopping basket. The change is called inflation (or deflation if its going down)",eli5

Please answer any sport you know and why, as I am very curious.","There are multiple reasons.

1. Professional athletes are an investment.  Whereas college athletes do not get paid  and are disposable, for profit teams have a more dedicated interest in the well being of their players.  Thus, more rules exist to protect the players.

1b.  More rules protecting player safety exist in the pros because the players have collective bargaining agreements, meaning that they can negotiate rules that will protect them (and thus, their careers and incomes).

2. College athletes are not as talented/developed, and thus, rules are looser with regards to specific technical movements.  This can be seen with the ""one foot in bounds"" rule in football, the shorter arc in basketball, and the less strict pass interference rules in football.

3. The different leagues and sports have different cultures.  Eventually, the minute differences become a way that each group can differentiate themselves, and they stick around for tradition's sake.

3oem7j,Why does WinRAR never actually require payment? ,"From _URL_1_

 > Winrar is licensed as ""shareware"", the license type is mostly outdated now, but back in the 90's you would see most software marketed as either freeware (free to use), shareware (free to try, pay to use), or just plain paid software. These days we see more software released in the demo/full version form, although some software companies still release shareware (pretty sure Photoshop is still released this way, 30 days full/free, paid after it expires, although it's no longer called ""shareware"") 

 > A lot of shareware was released like Winrar back in the day, where paying for the software was more of an option than a requirement. By not blocking the customer out after 30 days it garners the customers respect and the developer hopes that you'll eventually pay for it, even if you've used it for a year or two. Even if you don't, you'll probably recommend it to a friend and your friend may become a paying customer. 

 > It's basically writing software with the hope that enough customers will pay to make it worthwhile. Winrar probably sticks with this model simply because its worked for them for so long. 

It seems like they base it on honesty and trust. They trust that when you are fully satisfied with their service, and that it meets your requirements, that the customer will pay the fee

12xptw,How did Greece get in such a bad financial situation ? I find it interesting that a country with such a history can get in such a bad economic situation and im wondering what went wrong and how are they going to fix the issue.,"ELI10: All countries that control their own money have a ""hidden"" way to tax the people: inflation.  If you print more money and spend it, then the value of all money goes down slightly.  That's like a tax on money itself.  

Greece used this system of taxation for a long time, using drachmas -- they would create more drachmas out of thin air and spend them on government projects or entitlements.  That was like a tax on drachma ownership.

Then they joined the Euro commonwealth.  (A group of states that agree on a single currency is called a ""commonwealth"".)  The Greek government does not control the Euro, so they cannot create more Euros out of thin air.  Suddenly they had to tax in other ways to make ends meet.  But they were unable to make that happen politically.  Suddenly, they had to balance their budget!  To do that, they had to either spend less, raise other kinds of taxes, or borrow money from other people who owned Euros.  They couldn't bring themselves to raise taxes, so they started borrowing Euros.  

The problem they ran into is that, eventually, people started noticing just how much money Greece was borrowing - and they started getting squirrelly about lending any more money to them.  

When people stopped wanting to lend Greece money, then Greece had to pay higher interest rates.  That meant they had to borrow even *more* money to cover the interest payments. *That* made their budget problem even worse. 

A government like the U.S. borrows money in currency that it controls.  That is good: the U.S. can *always* pay back its dollar debts, since it can create dollars out of thin air.  (Unless ~~brigands~~Republicans deliberately stall the process).  But a government like, say, New York does not control its own currency, so it has to balance its budget.  Greece went from being more like the U.S. to being more like New York, but didn't adjust its taxing and spending like it should have.",eli5

I am a fan of baseball and every once in a while some story will come out accusing someone of using pine tar to cheat but they never explain why this stuff is considered cheating. ,"Hitters use pine tar to get a better grip on the bat, and so they use less of their strength for grip and more for control.  It is completely within the rules, so long as it is on the first 18 inches of the bat.

What is against the rules to have a foreign substance on the hitting surface of the bat.  Since pine tar doesn't confer any advantage here, it is considered fairly poor sportsmanship to have the umpires enforce this.  The real purpose of the rule is to conserve baseballs, which have to be taken out of play if they get tar on them.

Since pine tar is plentiful, pitchers have a plausible excuse to ""accidentally"" have it on they hands or clothing, and can use it to doctor baseballs...although it is questionable if it helps.

So in reality, pine tar is rarely used to cheat, because there is really not way to use it to get an illegal advantage.",eli5

5vty34,"In video games, why is it so difficult for developers to make it so objects do not pass through one another? For example, in Ghost Recon: Wildlands my character's weapon passes through his tactical vest when in reality it should be in front. ","Imagine that you're in charge of creating the world around you.  You have a pen that can draw anything in that space, and you have a rule book that creates all of the rules for that world.  

Let's say that you really want to see a sword fight in your world, so you draw two swords.  After you're done drawing, you realize that they're just floating there, so you create a rule to have them swing at each other.  

So these swords start swinging, but you see that they just pass through each other.  They don't stop and bounce off each other because your rulebook only says to swing, it says nothing about bouncing off of each other when they touch.  So you have to create a rule that says that if the two swords touch, they have to stop their movement and bounce off each other.  First you have to create a rule that determines what touching means.  Then you create a rule about how to tell if the two things are touching.  Then you create a rule about what to do when those two things touch.  

Not content with your clashing swords, you decide that you need create a much more elaborate fight.  So you draw a couple of knights, some horses, a shield or two, and a fancy background.  As you build more and more, you realize you have to create a lot more rules.  Everything has to be defined.  Suddenly there are a lot of rules and a lot of objects you have to keep track of.  That's a lot of thinking you have to do!

So you have an idea.  You realize that you don't really care if the cloud you drew up in the sky bumps into a tree and bounces the right way, right?  It's a waste of time to keep checking to make sure the cloud follows the rules about bouncing the right way, so you decide to take away the rule about clouds bouncing off objects.  Now you don't have to worry about tracking the clouds, and you can focus on drawing other things and making sure everything else is following the rules you wrote.  

That's an oversimplification, but that's pretty much why hit detection isn't always done for all objects in games; devoting resources to hit detection takes computational resources and may not be worth it.  

A computer doesn't just ""know"" when two objects collide.  If you've got a sword with very complex geometry, and another sword with complex geometry, it takes a lot of math to determine if any part of either sword is touching any other part of the other sword. In many instances, those kind of calculations have to be done for every object in every frame.  

In your example (the gun through the vest), it would take a lot of math to not only determine where your gun and vest were colliding, but also to calculate where the objects should be relative to each other.  There is probably a hit box (the geometric shape that is tracked for hit detection) around the player and the gun, but it probably doesn't include all of the details of the vest, because that intricate geometry would be hard to track.",eli5

Atoms *can be* magnetic. Electrons in atoms tend to group in pairs, orbiting in such a way that their magnetic moments cancel out, which means only atoms with half full, or nearly half full, outer shells (Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, etc) are magnetic.

Lots of magnetic atoms together in a material *might be* magnetic.

5rrzms,What is a Riemann Surface and why is it significant? I came across [this](_URL_0_) article and assumed Riemann Surfaces must have serious implications if she won the Fields Medal for her work on them. I tried to read about them but it was like a foreign language. I literally couldn't understand anything about them or why they are significant. ,"I'm currently just being introduced to the topic of complex variables, but I think I may know what Riemann surfaces are.

Since I don't know your math background, I'll start off by saying that complex variables are just numbers involving both a real component and an imaginary component (represented by a number followed by the letter i). An example would be 3+2i where 3 is the real part and 2i is the imaginary part. You can do some pretty cool stuff with them, including take derivatives, invent new functional traits, but one cool thing you can do is graph them.

As it turns out, graphing complex numbers is a little different than real numbers. For instance and to digress, real numbers lie on a 'real number line'. That's a pretty straightforward concept, with negative numbers lying to the left side of the line in decreasing order, positive numbers to the right side of the line in increasing order, and 0 in the center. Complex numbers on the other hand lie on a 'complex number plane'.

What essentially happens is you take your real number line from earlier, and that now becomes your 'x-axis' for this new plane. You then add a 'y-axis' perpendicular to the x-axis, and this axis is your imaginary component axis, with positive i values lying upwards, and negative i values lying downwards. You can then proceed to graph stuff like 3+2i on the complex number plane by proceeding 3 positive units in the x direction, and two positive units in the y direction. You essentially just added a imaginary number line to your real number line to make a complex number plane. (Cool note here, if you happen to know the relationship i^2=-1, then think about taking a real number 3 which lies on the x-axis, multiply it by i, giving you 3i, which now lies on the y-axis (rotates 90 degrees), then multiply by i again, giving 3i^2=-3 which lies on the x-axis but in the negative x direction (180 degree rotation). So is 'i' just something you multiply numbers by to perform a rotational transformation? Neat thought!) Pretty awesome stuff, but that is only useful in graphing points. To graph functions of complex variables requires a function of 4 dimensions, which humans are incapable of doing. But I've introduced all necessary topics, and now I will finally address your question by presenting a few more.

How do you rank the magnitude of these complex numbers? In other words, how do you tell if one complex number is bigger or smaller than another? Is 3+2i larger than 1+387i? Or is 543-4i bigger than either of those? How do you define infinity? As it turns out there are no good answers to those questions. And that's where Riemann surfaces come in.

Riemann surfaces are a number of possibly infinitely many sheets that cover the entirety of the complex plane. The simplest Riemann surface that I know of is a sphere, so that's what I'll use to attempt to explain this.

What Riemann proposed, is that you take a sphere, assign values to all the points along the sphere, and cut it through the equator with the complex number plane. From here, you draw an arrow, which always begins with its tail originating at the North Pole of the sphere, to the coordinate on the complex number plane of the point you wish to know. I should give you note, that the complex number plane stretches infinitely far beyond the radius of the sphere, i.e. the plane is much bigger than our sphere. Where the arrow makes contact with the sphere is the value of whatever you are looking for. There are actually two possible scenarios, 1. If the point on the complex number plane lies outside of the sphere then the arrow will make contact with the sphere before making contact with the plane, and will be a positive value. Or 2. The point on the complex number plane lies within the sphere, and the arrow must be extended beyond the complex number plane to strike the sphere on the negative value side.

That may not make very much sense, but drawing may help. It's also good to note, that infinity lies at the North Pole. This means, that as our point on the complex number plane increases in either it's real or imaginary value (i.e. Extends farther outward in ANY direction along the complex number plane) then our function increases closer to infinity. It's also interesting to note, that zero lies along the 'rotationary axis' of our sphere (I.e. If our arrow was to be drawn from the North Pole to the point (0,0i) (which is the South Pole) that would be considered a value of zero.) Also interesting to note is that negative infinity no longer exists, we simply only care for infinity at this point. 

There is a lot of mathematical terminology associated with this, and I may have butchered explaining it, or explained it totally wrong, so take this all with a grain of salt. But other conditions include stuff involving e-hoods and differentiability of complex functions which step up the difficulty by quite a bit. Complex variables is also really quite fascinating, as well as Riemann's work and his life, so I hope this didn't totally dissuade you from any future math potential/ careers. Best of luck!",eli5

6z398m,Why do we feel hot when the air is as hot as or colder than our internal body temperature?,"Because our bodies don't just sit at our preferred temperature.  Humans are warm-blooded;  we produce heat constantly as a byproduct of the chemical reactions in our body that maintain our metabolism.  That means that we have to constantly get rid of heat at the rate that our body produces it just to stay at the same temperature.  Otherwise, we'll overheat and possibly die.

When the air is near our internal temperature, the rate at which we lose heat to the environment slows down.  When the air reaches our internal temperature, we can no longer lose heat the normal way, and we have to sweat, which allows us to lose heat via evaporative cooling.",eli5

bt93v3,Why specifically does the Northern part of Africa have desert land? I’m assuming it’s on the same geographical level as other countries that have no desert at all? ,"Climate is much more than just latitude
Things like altitude, geography, air currents, water currents, all of that factors in.

England for example is at the same latitude as parts of Canada that are covered in snow much of the year, yet England has a much milder climate. This is because the north Atlantic ocean current drives warm water and subsequently warm air right to the British isles.

As for the Sahara it is believed that northern Africa regularly went through periods of humidity where it rained a lot and there were lakes and rivers and forests full of life, and periods where the air was dry and all the water dried up and everything died. This was caused by small changes in the planets tilt on its axis. Then at some point some factor changed in this sensitive balance that threw the whole system out of whack. 

Current thinking is that this coincides with the spread of humans and agriculture across africa. As northern africa was transitioning from a humid period to a dry period humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to domesticated animals and farming in order to survive which could have lead to over grazing, over farming and destruction of vegetation. This vegetation would have been needed to provide the moisture in the air to trigger a new humid phase when the time came. Without it the next humid phase was never triggered and the system spiralled out of control leading to the eventual creation of the Sahara desert.",eli5

61wpmh,"the Christian relationship to the Old Testament. If the New Testament came along and changed much of the OT's doctrines, why is the OT still considered just as valid? Why isn't Christianity just based on the NT? ","This is actually a pretty big question in some Christian communities. There is a question as to whether or not the Old Covenant is still ""legally"" binding to Christians. There are generally three trains of thought;

1) Christ's New Covenant was sealed and put into effect at the Sermon on the Mount, nullifying the Old Covenant.

2) Christ did *not* nullify the Old Covenant at the Sermon on the Mount, and the New Covenant only came into effect either at the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and/or after he rose from the dead after the three days, at which point the Old Covenant was nullified, and the New Covenant sealed, with the Last Supper being the traditionally held moment of importance. This is also the primary view held throughout most Christian denominations.

3) The Old and New Covenants are both binding, although the New Covenant obviously takes precedence if there's a conflict of doctrine.

This also calls into question what nullifying the Old Covenant means; some believe it means that literally everything in the Old Covenant is no longer important (other than the bits that the Rabbinic Jews refer to as the Seven Laws of Noah, which are basically covered in the 10 Commandments), while others believe that the Old Covenant should still be respected even though it's not important anymore. Furthermore, there are some that believe that the moral codes of the Old Testament are still binding, but the ceremonial codes aren't (which is how you get shellfish-eating homophobes, as well as other cases of people selectively following Old Testament rules).

So in short, to many Christian communities, the Old Testament *isn't* as valid, and is merely taught as a background needed in order to understand the New Testament and the New Covenant (particularly given that Jesus' authority at least partially comes from the prophecy of the Messiah, which is given in the Old Testament).",eli5

1v79ug,Why are gag orders legal? Wouldn't it violate the constitution or something?,"At first glance, they do look like they would cause some issues with freedom speech.  However, a big part of the legal system is to attempt to provide people with fairness and justice.  When a gag order is issued, a judge forbids people involved with a court case from talking about the case publicly.  This is necessary because the point of a trial is to have an unbiased group of peers decide guilt based on evidence presented during the trial.  Publicizing information can limit the number of people who can come into the courtroom as fully neutral jurors.  Also, gag orders prevent the parties involved from taking advantage of access to the media and arguing their cases in an unregulated way.  

The general idea is that freedom of speech is not absolute and there is a strong interest in maintaining fair trials, so gag orders are necessary.  It's worth noting, though, that gag orders only apply to those involved in the trial.  A news reporter still has freedom of speech/press, making it legal for the reporter to talk about the case.",eli5

270f8f,Why does soda fizz more when ice is added to it? I poured a glass of soda today and added ice. It fizzed almost like baking soda and vinegar. Why is that?,"Bubbles in soda are caused by dissolved CO2 gas (carbon dioxide) which are escaping the liquid. Soda / water can only hold so much CO2, and when it holds as much CO2 as it can, it is called a saturated solution. You can increase the capacity of a liquid to hold gas or other solutes by increasing the temperature of the solution - the opposite is also true - when you decrease the temperature, you decrease the solution's ability to hold the solute. 

Adding cold ice lowers the temperature of the soda, especially the area right around the ice - which in turn lowers the ability of the water to hold the CO2. The CO2 (Bubbles) suddenly escape the solution, causing fizz to form.",eli5

851xy0,why don’t we have sprinklers in single family homes in the US? ,"It's not worth it

A multifamily dwelling is significantly more likely to have a fire than a single family home, the greater likelihood and greater potential damage justifies the increased cost

Sprinklers also require regular maintenance to function properly. If you don't drain your sprinklers every few months then they'll fail when you need them. Putting them in a home where you can't ensure maintenance is wasting money as they won't work when needed

There are about a thousand house fires per day in the US, there are 126 million homes. If sprinklers cost $10k and a burned down house costs $1M then it would take 34 years to pay back the investment. That's not remotely worth it to insurance companies so they don't push for it",eli5

3wk1it,"In video game software, what is a ""graphics engine"", why is it called that, how does it work and why are there so many different ones?","an engine is the entire framework that drives the game's backend, communicating with the OS and drivers, do the calculations all games have, handle physics and object management, lighting and rendering, e.t.c.; an engine is to a game what a foundation and infrastructure is to a house. it makes game development easier since a developer can instantly start working on his game instead of having to write the entire framework first.

.

a graphic engine is a specialized part of engines that deal with rendering and processing the graphics of a game (hence the name). a graphic engine has the framwork needed to connect and communicate with the graphic drivers of the compute and the Video card as well as processing shaders and passing them down to the GPU, and such. it calculates all lighting, shadows, models, animation and everything you see, basically. 

.

There are so many different ones because many have been made. Each engine is specially tailored and optimized to do something differently or incredibly well. Some engines might have been programmed to be able to calculate very complex lights very fast, others might be better at realistic animation shaders or whatever. Each company might want to build their own engine instead of buying it if it finds that they do not wish to pay for the licence or want control over their own assets.",eli5

5hy8ud,"Why is arterial blood brighter than venous blood? I want to know the biochemical difference in arterial and venous blood that makes one ""darker"" than the other. I know it is related to the amount of CO2 in venous blood being way higher than in arterial but how does that change the blood color to a darker tone of red?

","The color comes from the pigment inside of hemoglobin, which contains Iron(III), and turns red when it reacts with oxygen (just like rust). However, hemoglobin doesn't always want to have oxygen, since it has to let go of the oxygen at the place it's supposed to deliver it. So hemoglobin has two modes which corresponds to whether or not it wants oxygen. The two states are relaxed (open) or tensed (closed). When hemoglobin is in an environment where there's a lot of oxygen, not a lot of CO2, and low pH (such as in the lung) the protein is in open mode and is more accepting of carrying O2. When hemohlobin is in an environment where there's a lot of CO2, high pH, and low O2 (like your muscles), then it goes into close mode so it can make sure the O2 goes free to be absorbed. 

The relaxed form when it's bound to oxygen, absorbs less light around the 660nm area (Bright red), which is reflected into our eyes. The tense form when it's not bound to oxygen absorbs slightly less light around the 940nm area, but the reflected light appears dark anyway.

459boe,"Why is today's announcement of the discovery of gravitational waves important, and what are the ramifications? ","Edit: I wrote my original answer in response to OP's question, but there still seems to be a lot of confusion. It might help if I write a bit of a summary about what gravitational waves actually *are*, and I'm adding that to the top here:

**What are gravitational waves?** **What is LIGO?**

- In Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, gravity isn't just a ""force"" that pulls objects. Instead, you can think of space as like a sort of fabric, and that a large object will put a dent in the fabric, causing other objects to move in bent paths as they move through the bent fabric. You've probably seem [images like this](_URL_0_) before, though this is a loose metaphor, and you shouldn't take it too seriously.

- Gravitational waves are a ""wave"" in this fabric. Like any fabric, a big jolt will cause a shock to flow along it. Something like [colliding black holes](_URL_1_) will do it.

- A gravitational wave is a wave of *stretching* and *contracting*. Along the wave, space gets squished and unsquished again. A circular object becomes [a little bit oval](_URL_2_) This effect is very very small - it's happening all the time and we don't notice it.

- We built machines that fires lasers over several kilometres to measure tiny changes in that distance, to detect the tiny effects of gravitational waves. It's so sensitive, it can measure changes in length down to less than the size of a proton. They built two in opposite corners of the US, but there are other ones being built around the world. The American ones recently got an upgrade. The American machines are called LIGO, and they've now been upgraded to ""Advanced LIGO"".

- And these upgraded machines actually detected gravitational waves!

- We've had a long time to think about what pattern of wibbles a gravitational wave from colliding black holes should look like, and it turns out the waves we found look exactly like what we were expecting! Even more specifically, we can say how big these black holes were, and about how far away they were - about 30x the mass of our Sun each, and about billion light years away.


----

**And then, to answer the original question: why is this important?**

Two big things!

Firstly, General Relativity has always predicted that gravitational waves should exist. However, they are very weak, and even the most sensitive detectors should only detect the most dramatic ones - the ""chirp"" of gravitational waves that comes from the merger of two neutron stars, or even better, two black holes.

Recently, the LIGO detectors have been upgraded so that they finally have the sensitivity to detect the strongest of gravitational waves. And a few months ago, both sets of detectors (one in Louisiana, one in Washington state) detected a [chirp](_URL_3_) of gravitational waves, fitting exactly the pattern of frequencies you'd expect from the merger of two black holes about a billion light years away with a mass of about 30x our Sun each.

**This detection is a massive confirmation of General Relativity**. It would be worrying if we didn't detect anything, but this really confirms that our understanding of gravity and the universe is correct.

Secondly, this opens up an entirely new field of observational astronomy. Astronomy works mostly through telescopes that observe different types of light waves - visible light, infrared, x-rays, radio waves, etc. But gravitational waves are an entirely different thing, and they give us a wholly new point of view on the universe, letting us see things we couldn't see otherwise.

For example, something that's 30x the mass of our Sun is a pretty small object to see at a distance of a billion light years! Black holes are also really really small (these are like 90 km across). So we detected something less than 100 km across that was a billion light years away! And that's something that would be pretty much impossible to do with any other current method.

**It really is a wholly new window into the universe.**",eli5

1xzi4a,Why is belly fat so hard to lose? Thank you for front page everybody!,"Your body starts storing fat around your hips, thighs  &  essential organs(belly area). Once these places start to get hefty, your body then moves outwards towards your arms and feet. If you are at the point where you are storing lots of fat in your arms then when you burn calories, your body will ~~take it from~~ heavily favor fat in your arms rather than your belly fat. (This has something to do with protecting and/or warming your vital organs in the event of disaster) This is why if you start an intense running program, the first place you will start to lose fat is in your arms and lower legs. Eventually, if you continue an intense running program, that weight will start to come off of shoulders and thighs. Finally, once all of the remote fat stores are depleted, your body will start using the fat around your vitals(belly).

Your body stores fat using a F-I-L-O algorithm. (First In Last Out). An analogy: If you were to stack 10 papers, in order to get the first paper off of the stack, you would have to remove the top 9 papers. In other words, if you want to get at the belly fat, you have to attack your whole body mass % as a whole. It is impossible to ""Target"" belly fat. If someone told you they did a bunch of crunches and they got a flat stomach, its because of the calories they burnt, not because their stomach got amazingly strong. Having a six pack is about low body fat, not super big stomach muscles.

* The second type of itch is called ""neuropathic itch"" and is caused by nerve damage that results in an itching sensation, despite the fact that the skin above looks normal. 
* The third type of itch is called ""neurogenic itch"". This type is similar to neuropathic itch in that it involves the nervous system, but it is not caused by damage. Instead, when certain chemicals interact with the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), it can cause an itching sensation elsewhere in the body.

1dvddi,"Why is the new DSM-V getting so much hate from mental health organizations? Why is the new DSM-V getting so much hate from mental health organizations? I'm a biologist so I don't really know too much about the DSM, but I would think people would be happy with newer definitions based on the latest research. 
Thanks guys!","The DSM-5, just like all the previous editions, has explicitly spelled out the guidelines in order to be diagnosed. I'll use depression as an example. If you go to a psychologist claiming to feel depressed or sad, they will look at your symptoms, and you must have a certain number of symptoms, sometimes in a certain combination, to get the diagnosis. Sometimes you only need a few symptoms that are fairly common, so it is extremely easy to get a diagnosis from just day to day symptoms of living. Other times, it is very hard, and people who have a valid problem cannot be treated because their symptoms are not exactly what is in the DSM.

Another big problem with the DSM-5 is that they've included a lot more disorders. This is good because more people are covered now, but bad because some of the things that have been added are arguably not disorders at all, but could now be treated with drugs. It's one more step in the trend to try to eliminate individual differences that may not necessarily be problematic or treated with drugs.

I'm taking these examples from Wikipedia, so I'm not sure what's actually being added and what's just been discussed, but among the new disorders proposed for the DSM-5: Internet Addiction Disorder, Parental Alienation Syndrome (preferring one parent over another), Complicated Grief Disorder (grieving for too long), and Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (being daydreamy, easily confused, ect.). Some could argue that these are just parts of the human experience that one needs to overcome, not an actual mental disorder.

I'm a psychology major who is familiar with the DSM-IV, and I don't think that there's a way to really make the DSM ""perfect"". There will always be problems and discrepancies. But if my psychologist ever told me that I had ""sluggish cognitive tempo"" because I daydream and tried to put me on Ritalin, I'd probably walk out of that office and never go back.",eli5

I feel like my vote has very little influence (as a 19 year old Republican) in California.","The electoral college has nothing to do with an ability to count individual votes.
The original purpose of the electoral college wasn't simply that the government didn't trust the direct opinion of the common voter, it was also a way to check the power of the most populous colonies (remember we started as a union of more or less independent colonies and they didn't like the idea of simply allowing the biggest ones to run ramshod over the smallest only because they had more people).  Each state has as many electors as they have House reps + Senate Reps.  And since each state has 2 Senate reps the smallest states have proportionally more electoral power per resident than the larger states.    It's a small measure (at this point) against the federal government catering too strongly to the needs of NY/CA/TX.  

It's basically the only thing that gets presidential candidates to bother campaigning in small states.",eli5
3vl9zy,"Why is it that the middle part of the E.M. Spectrum (Infrared to UV) can't go through walls but radio waves and gamma radiation can? It seems to me that IR is able to go through walls and gamma radiation as well, but IR, UV and the visible spectrum cannot or at least cannot be detected easily. Asked my physics teacher and he didn't know nor could he find an answer online.","This has to do with absorption, which is related to the energy levels in the atoms and molecules present in walls.  Longer wavelengths of light (radio waves) do not correspond to atomic or molecular energy levels that have electrons ready to take the energy.  The light has to be able to move electrons to different orbitals, but this takes a particular amount of energy.  Since the light does not interact with the material, it simply passes through.  

Higher energy light (X-ray and gamma rays) can pass through, but still some will be absorbed.  This radiation is often called ionizing radiation, because it can remove core electrons from atoms.  When it does this, energy is transferred to the electron and can damage the material, but the light is now gone.  Sometimes, the X-rays (which are small) can miss these electrons and pass through.  If the material is thick enough they won't make it.  Similar to a sheet of paper and visible light.  Some visible light can go through a sheet, less through 2, and at some point none.",eli5

3ehkrv,Why there is a movement in Canada to abolish the senate? ,"The purpose of 'bicameralism' or having two chambers of government is to balance different voting principles. In the United States, Congress' seats are proportional to the population, so California has over 50 congressmen and Rhode Island has just 1, but Senators are by state, so California and Rhode Island each have 2. It's meant to balance the power of the states.

In Britain, the House of Lords is meant to represent the wealthy and to be unaccountable to party politics. The idea is that they won't allow policies that are politically expedient but bad.

The Canadian Senate is meant to be like the House of Lords, slowing down radical or temporary policies. They are appointed by the Prime Minister, who is meant to pick people who are really smart scholars and such. In practice, they pick people who they owe favors to.

Also, unlike the Senate in the USA, the Canadian Senate can't actually stop a law from passing. They can only send a law back with a note asking 'are you sure', suggesting changes that Parliament is not required to implement to pass the bill anyway.

Many in Canada would like to see senate *reform* rather than senate abolition. The Canadian Senate could provide a proportional representation house that would not reduce the local power of the provinces but would stop bills that are broadly unpopular. 

Others want to see a German Bundesrats style senate, where each premier (provincial leader) has staff on the senate. We already have an unofficial version of this we call 'negotiated federalism' where constitutional powers denoted to the Provinces are 'loaned' to the federal government. This body could handle that in an official capacity.

Still others support the current senate structure. It's a way to recognize Canadian political celebrities like Romeo Dallaire and to give them a platform to promote positive ideas. They argue that the Prime Minister's central power is important to the Canadian model and that weakening that power wouldn't be a good idea for government, but letting old Prime Ministers have an 'echo' that's remembered is good for national discourse.

None of these opinions are 'wrong', and each takes Canada in a different direction. Personally, I'm a reformist - I'd love to see the German option, where the Federal government needs approval from a council body for laws that might infringe on Provincial rights, like changes in the tax code, transfer payments, health policy, and so forth.",eli5

208xrk,Why do humans develop so much slower than other animals? Like dogs/horses/cows take almost no time (weeks) to survive in the wild while a human would take years to be self sufficient in the wild.,"Guys, guys, guys... it's not just brain size. You're forgetting the whole 'bipedal' thing.

Humans walk on two legs instead of four. This means that the bone structure of our hips is vastly different than most other animals. One side effect of this, is that the birth canal is much narrower for us than for other animals, and it also puts constraints on the size  &  position of the uterus.

As a result of these constraints, a human fetus is born when it is smaller than would be expected for closely-related animals of our size. Other animals (like horses  &  cows  &  elephants) get to gestate until they're nearly developed enough to walk. A human fetus is pushed out literally as soon as it can breathe (the hormone that initiates labor originates in the fetus' lungs). There is a recent parenting trend of saying a newborn child is in the ""fourth trimester""--this perspective has some biological foundation.

In theory, humans could probably have evolved to be more self-sufficent (i.e. ambulatory) at birth despite being smaller. For example, Giant Pandas are stupid tiny when born (4oz--""the size of a stick of butter"") and they're crawling around in 2-3 months, although they nurse for 18 months. Our evolutionary path developed social structures, rather than physical changes to newborns, to ensure the survival of such small infants.",eli5

406x42,How did someone first discover that it takes 365.25ish days to go around the sun? ,"A combination of astronomical measurements and recording the dates on which observable astronomical events occur.

Long, long, long ago, humans counted the days between summer solstices, and called that a year. This was found to be 365 days long.

Later, as states and religions developed, the need for divisions between day and year arose. This gave rise to the concept of months, initially based around the time between full moons. The ancient Egyptians, for example, had a calendar with 12 months of 30 days each, plus five extra days at the end of the year.

The Decree of Canopus, written in 238 BCE, recommends having an extra day every four years. The Decree is a record of an assembly of priests in Canopus under Pharaoh Ptolemy III; evidently, the extra six hours were known even back then. It appears to have first been worked out by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who lived from 408 BCE to 355 BCE; all his writings have been lost, but he is extensively quoted in the writings of Hipparchus of Nicaea, who verified his measurements with his own observations and comparisons with the wor of Meton of Athens and Euctemon of Athens. We know that Hipparchus measured the exact time the sun reached its highest position in the sky on solstice day; Eudoxus appears to have done the same.

This phenomenon was known to the Romans, but was not at first accounted for in the calendar. The first Roman calendar, traditionally attributed to the mythical Romulus, had 10 months of 30 or 31 days each, for a total of 304 days, plus another 61 days stuck on to the end of the year.

The second Roman calendar, traditionally attributed to the legendary Numa Pompilius, added the month of January and February to the start of the year to make up the 61 monthless days, and rejigged the total number of days per month to 29 or 31, with February having 28 (the Romans thought that even numbers were unlucky). This ultimately resulted in a year that was 355 days long, 10.25 short of the actual length; from what I can gather, it was seen as more important to have a whole number of months with no days left over.

The Romans were well aware that this was inaccurate, and so to maintain synchronisation with the solar year would occasionally add an extra month partway through February every two years; this extra month was alternately 22 or 23 days long. This added up to an average year of 366.25 days over a four-year period, meaning that the solstices and equinoxes as well as religious festivals would tend to drift backward through the year.

There were also political issues. In the Roman Republic, the lengths of political offices were, quite sensible, defined by calendar year. The extra month was decreed by the pontifex maximus, which could happen quite a short time before the extra month actually started. As such, a pontifex could refuse to decree an extra month if his enemy was consul, or could decree one if his ally was in power.

To add to this, extra months would often be ignored completely during times of war. As such, by the mid-first century BCE, nobody knew what the actual date was. Sorting out this mess was a plank of Julius Caesar's dictatorship.

Caesar apparently heard about leap days from Acoreus while he was in Egypt in 48 BCE. Almost as soon as he seized control of the Senate in 46 BCE, Caesar called in the greatest astronomers and mathematicians in Rome. This is traditionally said to have included Sosigenes of Alexandria and Marcus Flavius, who worked out a new Roman calendar using the existing months, but taking the idea of fixed-length calendar from Egypt and Persia, and setting that length at 365.25 days as determined by the Greeks.

The result of this was the Julian calendar, which has the same months as the previous Roman calendar, but of different lengths, and it adds one extra day to the end of February every four years. This keeps the calendar more or less in line with the solar year (though Caesar did have to decree that the year 46 BCE was 445 days long to bring the calendar back into sync). Since it was fixed in advance, there was no room for crafty politicians to mess with the length of the year.

This worked pretty well, but it wasn't quite accurate. By the 16th century, it was noticed that the date of the vernal equinox had drifted by a few days; since Easter is defined as the Sunday following the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere, it meant Easter also sometimes fell on a different date than would be expected, plus there was disagreement between easter and western churches over whether to use the calendar equinox of the astronomical equinox.

To this end, Pope Gregory XIII and the Council of Trent sought a more accurate calendar. Aloysius Lilius and Christopher Clavius came up with what we now know as the Gregorian calendar, named for the pope, in which three leap years are skipped every 400 years. This reduces the average length of the year by 10 minutes and 48 seconds, making an average year 365.2425 days long. This is the calendar most commonly in use today, though it took a while to be adopted for secular purposes, especially in Protestant countries - Britain famously had to skip 11 days when it adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752 to bring the dates in line.",eli5

38w2pg,"Why is American Pharoah winning the triple crown impressive sports feat? It sounds like a horse just ran fast for three races (to me, at least) ","hasn't happened in the last 37 years....that in itself is pretty remarkable.

Best way to compare it to see how huge an event it is would be like this

in the case of the Kentucky derby race - it's racing against 17 other horses.
At Preakness it raced against 7 other horses 
and at Belmont it raced against 9 other horses

And not any of the races were the same conditions (heat, mud, length of track, etc)

But lets say all the tracks were the same and all the horses were evenly skilled with evenly skilled jockeys. How many draws would you have to make in order to get the same winner in
first -  1 out of 18 draw
then a 1 out of 8 draw
then a 1 out of 10 draw

I am not great at statistics but I can tell you the odds are astromical. Now if you throw in that Kentucky derby is a short race requiring the horse to be the fastest but the Preakness is a long race requiring the horse to be fast but also have the most stamina - you are really looking for 2 different horse types.

It's really freaking rare because its 3 totally different large field events with different contestants and different circumstances.

It would be similar to a quarterback in the NFL leading three different teams to super bowl championships. (which has never happened) oh yeah - It's never happened that a quarterback has led two different teams to super bowl championships.

*(say different teams because there are totally different circumstances) For brady to repeat in new England is akin to American pharaoh winning Kentucky derby twice. but if brady could take the patriots and the buccaneers and the jets to the super bowl and win all the three games  - that would be similar to what American pharaoh just did.",eli5

1so1hj,"Why isn't it possible to harness energy from earth's rotation on its own axis? I imagine I'm not the first one to think of this, so could please someone explain this to me.

Is it possible to build something like a turbine on the extreme center of the north/south pole and completely rely on earth's own rotation?

_URL_0_","As others have stated, you can only get energy if there is relative motion. Any motor has two parts: the [rotor](_URL_2_) - the ""moving"" part - and the [stator](_URL_0_) - the ""stationary"" part. It really doesn't matter which is actually moving - what's important is that the two parts must have difference in motion.

This means that in your proposal, you must have something that doesn't spin with the Earth. As everything is spinning with Earth anyways, to get this ""stationary"" object to be stationary, you must ""spin"" it - you add energy to it. But then the best case scenario is that you're extracting the energy you've added to it. It's like using a bucket to lift water to power a water wheel - you never get more energy than you spend lifting the water up.

Or, if you wish, you can analyze the system much more simply by assuming the Earth to be the stator. The question is now no different from having a dead motor in your hand and wondering why you can't get energy out of it: you need the motor to spin somehow!

That said, there _is_ one way you can harness some of Earth's rotational energy - more specifically, the energy of the Earth/moon system - [tidal energy](_URL_1_). The tides are caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the moon (and to a small part, the sun as well), and if you harvest the energy of the movement of water in tides, you're extracting energy from the Earth/moon system. You'll slow down the Earth's rotation (and cause the moon to orbit further out) by doing so.",eli5

9vuwb8,How come school busses don’t have seatbelts?,"There have been various studies regarding this. It seems counter intuitive but School buses don't have seatbelts because the drawbacks to having them outweigh the benefits.

Kids are actually safer in a school bus during an accident than in a car wearing a selt belt.

School buses are heavy and built very sturdy compared to cars. Also the kids are sitting high up compared to a car which is an advantage for safety in the majority of accidents. The seats are also quite tall and heavily padded to absorb energy. They are also close together to prevent much movement during a crash.

One of the big arguments is that not having seat belts speeds up evacuation as it's a lot faster for the kids to get off the bus after an accident. Kids also tend to move around a lot and don't like using seatbelts so it's hard to make them sit down and use them so it's better to design the vehicle to be safer then concentrate on specific safety devices.",eli5

Early on, the change in power gained exceeds the change in power loss, right up until you approach the optimal power range.  As you try to increase the rotational speed of the crankshaft and gear train above that, you start losing more power than you put in - essentially the inefficiencies have caught up and passed your additional power gained by the higher RPM.  In part this is caused by increased energy loss due to higher temperatures inside the cylinders, and increased drag caused by the lubricants (fluids react negatively to increased speeds following a velocity squared, giving it low resistance until it suddenly spikes upwards)",eli5

7zznr1,Why is there such a huge percentage of automatic transmission cars in the United States and Canada but other countries still have a high manual transmission percentage?,"Historically, manual transmissions generally offered better fuel economy than less-efficient automatic transmissions.  They were also (usually) significantly more expensive.  When you consider taxes and a much higher price for gas, manual transmission often made more sense in the European market.  Manuals were also cheaper from a maintenance perspective.

In North America, the convenience of an automatic transmission for people that generally drive much further distances than their European counterparts, coupled with cheaper gas and lower taxes, simply made automatics a more attractive option.

Nowadays automatic transmission are just as efficient and rarely an upcharge, so I imagine it's just habit keeping manuals popular in Europe and that trend will shift over time.

IMHO, all drivers should be taught about the advantages of holding gears and engine braking, even when driving an automatic.  Much better control in bad weather, and heavy traffic.

For example there's only one A vitamin, one K vitamin, one D vitamin etcetera.","From an old ELI5 post:
 > When vitamins and their functions were first being researched in the early 20th century an American scientist named Elmer McCollum isolated what we call vitamin A from butter fat and called it ""factor A."" He called another important nutrient that had previously been isolated from rice polishings by Casimir Funk, a Polish scientist, ""factor B."" Scientists continued to name vitamins in alphabetical order after that. (Edit: The German scientists who discovered vitamin K named it K for ""Koagulation,"" the German word for coagulation, since it helped blood coagulate. They skipped a letter or two in doing so, but it generally stuck to convention).

 > However, scientists discovered that ""factor B"" was actually a bunch of smaller compounds that were often found concentrated together in the same foods. These smaller compounds are the separate B vitamins (thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), etc.) and together they make up what we now call a vitamin B complex (the same as the original ""factor B""). We also now know that our bodies use the different B vitamins for distinct processes and that not all of the vitamins that have been classified as B vitamins are actually vitamins (this is the reason why there are only 8 B vitamins but the list appears to be longer - Bs 4, 8, 10, and 11 are no longer considered vitamins). This is the same thing that happened to vitamins F through J; they are no longer considered vitamins, so we skip from vitamin E to vitamin K.

qdact,"The difference between washer/drying settings (temperature, permanent press, etc) and why they matter ","Washer settings:

The first temperature given is the wash cycle, the second is the rinse cycle.

Various dyes have different color fastness depending on what you wash them in; for example, dark denim will give off a little bit of dye in cold water, but a lot in hot water, which not only causes the color to penetrate into your other clothing^1 but also fades it. Additionally, natural fibers (primarily wool and cotton) will ""felt"" if shocked with hot water-- the fibers lock together, which makes the article of clothing much less flexible and smaller (this is why you don't wash 100% wool sweaters on anything but cold/cold, and never put them in the dryer). The various tiers:

* **Cold water** is generally used for dark clothing, non-preshrunk cottons/anything pure wool, and items likely to bleed (silk should ALWAYS be washed in cold water). 
* **Warm water** is a good general purpose setting^2; most detergents don't work as well in cold water, and most fabrics are dyefast so you don't have to worry about bleeding (*always* wash a new dark item by itself first or with like colors, though, to make sure it won't bleed).
* **Hot water** is only used for light or white clothing (or if you're deliberately trying to felt/shrink something). You should always use hot water if you add (chlorine) bleach, because it is how bleach works best. If you wash a dark item in hot water, it is likely to bleed and/or shrink.

Dryer settings are more a matter of material.

* **Silks** should be air dried whenever possible, or on the ""air dry"" or ""delicate"" setting of the dryer.
* **Pure Wool** should always be air dried, unless it is preshrunk.
* **Cotton** is almost always preshrunk these days, so it's generally safe to dry it on high.
* **Synthetic fibers** can almost always be dried on high, but check the care label. Sometimes they smell weird if you dry them on high.
* **Perm press** is for items marked as such, usually a blend of natural and synthetic fibers designed to be wrinkle-free.
* With **Screenprinted items**, the ink may melt if they're dried too high; check the care label or use medium if unsure.

If something is marked **dry clean only**, you should listen to it unless you know what you're doing-- these items will severely bleed or need to be blocked after washing.


_^1 This is why you don't wash red items and white items together unless you're sure-- everyone has at least one pinkish shirt from not paying attention...

_^2 Some modern washers also have a ""cool"" setting, which is a better general-purpose setting; you save energy over using warm water, and the detergent works better than ""cold"".",eli5

1tv02x,Why does my laptop get incredibly hot and sometimes crash from streaming sites like Netflix ,"Well your laptop needs to think. Thinking makes it's core/brain use more energy. This energy is obviously electricity since we can't use it in other forms(e.g. fire). The more energy that passes through the core, the warmer it gets. Since Netflix has higher quality videos it means that your laptop's core/brain is doing more work and using more energy to process that information and this produces heat. Once the core gets to a certain point it does an emergency shutdown for health and safety reasons. Since you're pausing your Netflix it give the core time to process the information slower.

If you had a better laptop with a ""smarter, more efficient brain"" it would need less eneregy to porcess the information and play your video.",eli5

1) Pomegranates only grow in a few places during certain times of the year. This means that have to be transported a long distance and stored, which is expensive

2) On the subject of transportation, pomegranates have a pretty crappy weight/food ratio compared to other fruit (meaning there's a lot of parts of a pomegranate you can't eat). With apples, if you pay to transport 10 pounds of apple, there is 8-9 pounds of food there. With a pomegranate, there may only be 4 or 5 pounds of food, the rest is inedible.

1rbtmu,Why do most metals turn red when they get hot? ,"Everything above absolute-zero (0K, about -273C) radiates energy as photons (ie. light).  When you hold your hands up to something that is glowing red-hot (eg. a heater or fire) then you are feeling that energy on your hands.

The frequency (colour) of the radiant energy is a curve, and is related to the temperature.  The curve has a peak (google black-body radiation) where the bulk of the energy comes from, and falls off quickly to either side.

As something heats up, the radiation frequency curve moves to higher frequencies.  Higher frequency radiation carries more energy (energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency).  The hot object has more energy to radiate, so the easiest way to do this is to radiate higher energy photons.

3176y2,"Why are there so many different kinds of dogs of different sizes, shapes and features, yet only a few distinct breeds with cats? ","It has nothing major to do with the dogs or cats themselves, it has more to do with humans. Humans breed dogs and cats to have different features and humans were just more interested in breeding dogs than cats. This is probably because dogs are more versatile in the jobs (hunters, mousers, guard-dogs, companion, racing) they can perform for humans, whereas cats really only have one job (mousers). A human would be more interested in breeding dogs because they are more valuable to them.

I would say that cat breeding has definitely picked up (much like dog breeding has) in the past 50-100 years or so. Now there are over [50 cat breeds](_URL_0_). However, it is worth noting that breeds are not considered a biologically relevant or accurate way classifying animals because, much like human races, breeds are based on a shifting set of parameters.

But, immunosuppressives are also a treatment for ulcerative colitis itself.

6b18d2,What in our brains really triggers or causes the fight or flight response? ,"Anatomy student here.

u/kingofthetitans is essentially correct, but it's a bit more than that. 

::clears throat:: Basically, it's down to the *sympathetic nervous system*, which controls responses related to fight or flight (Pretty catchy if you ask me, and even if you don't). 

The “fight” part is activated by adrenaline (also called epinephrine as in “Epi-Pen”), which is released by glands that are above (“ad”) the kidneys (“renes”). Adrenaline raises your heart rate, increases breathing rate, and widens blood vessels, while at the same time slowing your perception of time (not enough to dodge bullets, but maybe enough to dodge a punch), and all of this is the body's best effort to survive a fight.

The flight response, on the other hand, while still having all the same effects and activation mechanics, may possibly throw in instructions from the brain to void bladder, bowels, and/or stomach, in an effort to make you as light as possible so you can GTFO should the need arise. This is most common in public social situations among children, where you might have seen or been the kid who was nervous enough at a recital to pee his/her pants.

And of those channels that broadcast the World Cup, many countries have laws that they must be free-to-air. That means channels cannot charge the viewers for them, decreasing the ""money making"". The ads on CBS will be seen by majority of Super Bowl viewers, and since the viewers for the World Cup are much more ""diluted"" they will not be able to charge the advertisers as much.

In MLM, the salespeople can actually sell a product. The problem is that they are often times set up to make it hard to succeed.

Post WWII gasoline (petrol for those across the pond) was really cheap and readily available. The US was enamored with going faster as we were in ""the jet age."" The easiest way to do that was to increase engine displacement. Cars got bigger and heavier and engines kept up. At some point they did get more efficient but the marketing kept large displacements desirable. 

In Europe and Asia the imperative was on small efficient cars and the smaller displacement higher efficiency engine was the way to go.

So here we are 70ish years later and we're finally seeing things normalize out. High horsepower roughly 2 to 3 liter (litre) turbo engines are being made by most manufactures to satisfy most needs.

Why haven't we seen more of them on computers and laptops replacing the current larger ports?,"**Standard USB is more durable.** I work in technology, and every single day I see someone who's managed to somehow bend/twist/break/torque those tiny pins inside a micro-USB connector. In contrast, USB pins are much wider, which makes them much more resistant to damage and corrosion.


**Standard USB is more widely supported.** USB drives, modems, cards, adapters, all sorts of gizmos use the large size. Imagine - if you had a laptop with micro-USB ports, you'd need a special connector just to use the large USB devices. What a hassle!


**Standard USB is being developed upon.** The USB 2.0 and 3.0 are plugs designed for faster data speeds, and a big way they did that is by adding more pins. In the large open standard USB plug there's plenty of room to add pins, but in the micro-USB connector it's already as small as it can get. This means that micro-USB is much less upgradeable, as far as protocols go.",eli5

3kxplp,Why is some sliced meat incandescent?,"The iridescence (incandescent means it gives off light, not shows rainbows) is caused by the long cells in the thinly sliced meat reflecting light and breaking it into its primary hues.

If you've ever seen [crazy pictures of rainbow patterns around lights](_URL_0_) like some camera lenses give, that's an example, except in the case of the meat the light bounces back at you rather than being given off.

1vluny,Why does hard exercise cause people to throw up? I just don't understand why you're body would react this way,"Exercise increases oxygen demand in the muscles being used. This causes the vessels supplying your skeletal muscles with blood to dilate, supplying a greater amount of blood. Conversely, areas of the body that are not essential for exercise (such as the digestive system and other inactive organs), experience a reduced blood supply. Essentially blood is rerouted from inactive organs to skeletal muscle. 
Exercise activates the sympathetic nervous system, known to most as the ""fight or flight"" response. This pours out hormones such as Epinepherine which increase heart rate, and cause dilation of the bonchioles in the lungs. Exercise also deactivates the Parasympathetic Nervous System known as the ""rest and digest"" response which shunts blood to the digestive tract, and stimulates salivation and digestion. Lack of parasympathetic output and decreased bloodflow to the digestive system  during exercise results in a temporary slowing of digestion which can make the person feel nauseated or having a previously consumed meal sit ""like a rock"" in the stomach during exercise.",eli5

jl6xj,Why so many people hated/still hate George W. Bush. ,"The hate of Bush comes mainly from Liberals, so I'll explain their point of view.

Bush instituted the Bush tax cuts which removed the tax on millionaires inheriting money as well as cutting taxes for businesses and corporations. This supply-side economic policy was said by Liberal to have undone completely the economic growth and budget surplus under the Clinton administration. 

Another reason for the hatred is Bush's belligerence. After 9/11, Bush had basically a blank check for invading whomever he wanted as long as he blamed them for the terrorist attacks. Afghanistan and Iraq were two such countries (although, in my opinion, Iraq was pretty unrelated to 9/11).

Additionally, many people thought he was just plain stupid. One of his more famous quotes is ""Is our children learning?"" which is grammatically incorrect and perhaps coincidentally a case in point. 

Overall, many people blame Bush for the situation we're in today: economic recession, stuck in two money-sucking holes in the Middle East, and left with a slew of Republicans who back his decisions and are hell-bent on reinforcing them.

That explanation is biased but grounded in truth, and you can't explain the hatred without the bias.",eli5

5m1lc9,Why do Serbs Croations and Bosnians hate each other? I know they were once Yugoslavia but now that they are three separate entities why do they still hate each other?,"Firstly, it's not like they all hate each other. Disclaimer aside:

There is a lot of cultural and religious tension from having three major religions in the same area (Catholic, Orthodox, Islam), which create cultural divisions that go back many centuries. They were all split up by major countries (Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians, Venetians), and developed different values, ideas, folk stories, worldviews, etc... and occupied for hundreds of years. Then suddenly they are put together into one country (which became Yugoslavia), after WW1. They are told to be ""one people, one country"" after WW2 when the communists won. The communists under Tito suppressed nationalism and religion and basically made everyone behave, since what mattered was national unity. 

When Tito, the head-honcho, died, no one else could step in to keep the country together and all those differences and old issues came back to the surface and they fought a series of vicious wars in the 1990s. There's still a lot of mistrust because of that.

This makes fighting some places very difficult for an honorable armed force because if they are trying to only attack the other side's armed force, but cannot tell them apart, then how do you not get a great deal of collateral damage?  This is why honorable armed forces wear a uniform, to distinguish themselves apart from what are, when you get down to it, innocent bystanders (aside from the whole 'I just live here, but I voted for the guy' issue that some might have, this is typically the case.)

But a chemical weapon, or a weaponized biological agent/disease, even a nuclear weapon, aka Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs)?  That is purely terroristic in nature, it is not controllable to attack just the opposition's armed forces, it attacks *everyone*, men, women, and most sadly, children.  The only reason for them is genocide or scare tactics.  They are otherwise a non-tactical item in warfare, and are just abominable that anyone uses them at all.*

War is hell, true, and there are *always* innocent causalties as well as friendly fire.  But any government that unleashes a WMD is just asking for some, if not all, of the civilized world's governments to barge in and either restrict that ability, or remove that rogue government.

aqlbhj,Why the sky is red on Mars  &  the sun sets blue while the opposite is true on earth?,"Two reasons, 1 is because of what makes up the atmosphere, and 2 how far light has to to travel in that atmosphere.

Ok earth, (I’ll call it blue light for simplicity) the blue light bounces off the air molecules, which enables us to see the blue hue in the sky. 

Since mars has about 1% the atmosphere compared to Earth, there isn’t a lot in the atmosphere for that blue light to bounce out of. It has much easier time with reds and oranges.

However, on Mars during a sunset, light has to travel a lot further due to perspective and position. So it goes through much more atmosphere than when it directly above, this gives more chance for blue light to hit the dust and air molecules on mars’ atmosphere. Thus giving us the blue color we don’t usually get to see.

This concept is called “atmospheric refraction” I believe, correct me if I’m mistaken.

Anyway, on earth it’s the opposite, since we have a dense atmosphere, we don’t have trouble seeing the blue light, but during the sunset, the blue light has to travel through so much that the blue light gets muted, compared to mars, with the fraction of density in its atmosphere. This leaves us with the reddish/orange colors that don’t have to struggle as much to get to our eyes.

A lot of vets find easy transitions because their skills are in high demand. Military technicians, mechanics, IT trades - those people have no problem. It's the combat arms folks - for example infantrymen - who have a hard time transitioning, because their skills aren't very useful in the civilian world (i.e. there's not a lot of jobs in the civilian world that are going to expect you to assault trenches or carry out ambushes). And these vets spent their ealy years building up a skill-set that was unmarketable in the civilian world where everyone else was in college, or an apprenticeship or what have you. So the combat-arms vet is basically starting out in the job market where most people were when they were 18, except the vet is an adult.

a4bf01,"Why does heat usually only emit infrared light, and not light of shorter wavelengths? ","Well, it isn't heat that emits light, but any  matter with a temperature above 0 Kelvin. So pretty much everything. Moreover, the light that is emitted has a spectrum with frequencies all over the erm... spectrum. This means that everything with mass and a non-zero temperature emits light from all over the spectrum. But here's the interesting bit. Of some frequencies more light will be emitted than of other frequencies. So instead of emitting white noise (all frequencies equally bright), it emits light (pretty much) according to [Planck's Law](_URL_2_). I get it if you won't read all of that, but as you can see in [this picture](_URL_1_), bodies with different temperatures emit light at different frequencies (or wavelengths in this case), and -we're coming to the crux of your question now- different peak frequencies. These peak frequencies will dominate the light, and so determine the colour we see.

And here's the fun bit. If you were to find the exact peak of the wavelength distribution, and plot as a function of the temperature of the body, then you get that the product of these two is constant. Or: the hotter an object is, the shorter the wavelength of the most intense wavelength and vice versa. For a room temperature object (about 300 Kelvin) this wavelength is about 9700nm, or within the infra red spectrum. But if we were to take an object, and heat up to 400°C (or \~750°F or \~700K), this peak drops to 4300nm, and now there even is enough light emitted in the visible spectrum that we can see it as a red glow.  
In fact, this is why things glow when they're hot! When you heat things up, they go from no glow over red to orange and yellow and white. When they glow white, there is enough light emitted in the visible spectrum to mix into a white light.

So, to summarize: everything emits light with a spectrum that depends on its temperature, and the frequency that emits the most light is inversely proportionate to the temperature of the body.

Finally, I'll leave you with what I find one of the most beautiful graphs in physics: [the solar radiation spectrum](_URL_0_). It shows that the sun emits light that is *really* close to the spectrum of a black body with a temperature of 5500K, which is how we know that the Sun's surface is that hot. It also shows some absorption bands (energy absorbed by elements in the atmosphere), but that's for another  ELI5...",eli5

Literally getting that cable into your house, having the infrastructure to run it and so on it’s a wildly complex and expensive business. Wildly. Telecom is a very difficult business to be in. 

Secondly, on the ads, for a “average” cable network, they only make about 50% of their revenue on ads.  The other 50% is in “carriage fees”. That is the cable company pays to show the channel to their customers.  Big networks like ESPN, Disney, or TNT get monster rates for each cable customer. 

The cable company has to pass on two big things to the consumer that becomes your bill: the cost of operating the company, and the cost to carry the channels. Both are enormous. 

Which gets to a strange point. Really the infrastructure cost is fairly “set”. It’s just the cost of actually getting you the cable. So what your cable bill really is going to is the networks like Disney (via carriage fees). 

The margins for video services from cable companies is currently very very low...many companies even lose money giving you video! I know you scream at your bill being so expensive, but really it’s true, video service margins are shit.

4imwqd,"Why is it that everything can tasted in the wine from the climate to the soil but pesticides are never mentioned? How much do pesticides effect wine? ""affect""","I make wine for a living. I could go on for hours about the bullshit propogated by sommeliers, but I will spare you the long read. There are really a very finite set of flavors you can taste in wine. Part of this is, of course trained expectation, but there is concrete scientific support for these flavors as well.
For example, when we make artificial vanilla extract, it more or less tastes like real vanilla. This is because they synthesize a compound called vanillin, which makes up the majority of the ""vanilla flavor"" you get if you eat an actual vanilla bean. In spite of this, there are over 300 flavor compounds identified that contribute to the flavor of natural vanilla. This same principle is true for most of the flavors you know. 
In wine you have an enormously complex system of bacteria and yeast that manipulate the chemicals (think naturally occurring grape constituents) in grapes. During this process they will often produce compounds we are familiar with, such as key flavor compounds in fruits. Because of this, we can say we taste citrus, or tropical fruit (banana, pineapple, mango etc.). This is further substantiated by something called Mass Spectrometry. This is basically a fancy instrument that can tell us what chemical compounds are in a solution (in this case wine).
I encourage you to buy a Sauvignon Blanc at the grocery (it doesn't have to be anything fancy, but preferably something in a regular wine bottle) and sit down with a WINE glass. Concentrate, and see if you can identify citrus flavors. This is often the easiest place to start, and I can almost assure you, you will be successful!
I will not attempt to refute the claim that brand perception heavily influences the perception of wine quality, but one could make this claim for virtually every product in the marketplace today.
The studies that showed sommeliers were unable to identify red vs. white wine, were somewhat flawed. That being said, I think this underscores the human mind's susceptibility to suggestion. You can read quite a bit about the implications of these studies with a few Google searches if you are interested.
Finally, the notion that pesticides to not influence flavor is not true. I highly encourage you to find a so called ""natural wine."" These have not been treated with sulfur, and as a result the natural bacteria (and to a much lesser extent, yeast) are allowed to ferment the grape juice unchecked. This often produces a very sour and unpleasant wine.
Conversely, if you were able to find a vineyard that was treated with sulfur right before harvest, you would find this impacted the flavor in a very very bad way. Oversulfured wine is hard to describe, but just try to imagine eating a rancid egg. You will never find this for sale, as we are required to report our sulfur levels, and wine with a high enough sulfur level to taste like this would never make it to market.
On a much less extreme note, there is a movement away from using moderate levels of sulfur, as we believe it may mute the delicate flavors of the wine, by killing the bacteria essential in producing the flavor compounds you recognize as citrus etc.

16r0yn,"The effects of Meth So I'm watching breaking bad, and it's making me curious; why does meth rot the body so much? Why do people get those nasty sores? Why do some people in the show not get as addicted to it as others? Is that realistic? What does it feel like to be on? ","> Why do people get those nasty sores?

Meth users often experience a psychological effect called [Dermatillomania](_URL_0_). This is the cause of the sores, they are self inflicted.

 > Why do some people in the show not get as addicted to it as others? Is that realistic?

Yes it is realistic. While it is **highly** addictive, it is not 100% addictive. Some people are able to use for short durations and quit using at their own discretion.

 > What does it feel like to be on? 

The brain has a function to reward you for biologically beneficial behavior such as eating, procreation, surviving in general. This is accomplished using a chemical called dopamine.

Meth triggers an uncontrolled release of dopamine. While I've never used, I can imagine that the first hit is probably one of the best feelings you will ever have in your entire life. An overwhelming sense of satisfaction, happiness, etc.

The problem is that you will never feel it again. The process by which dopamine makes us feel good is degraded with each use of meth. 

The more destruction of this process that takes place, the more dopamine you need to release to feel the same level of happiness. This results in meth users chasing that first experience, and why it is such a huge addiction risk. Eventually this neurological process is so damaged that they need the excessive dopamine levels just to feel normal.",eli5
1y241w,Tesla's Worldwide Wireless System and why did it fail. ,"It failed because of the inverse square law. Whenever you radiate something (sunlight, heat, or whatever) from a central point, the intensity decreases according to the square of the distance from that point. So, if you double the distance between you and the sun, the intensity of the light reduces to a quarter. Triple the distance, and it's a ninth. Etc. 

So if you transmitting wirelessly over any considerable distance, you're wasting most of it, and you have to drastically increase the power in order to increase the effective transmission distance a bit. It's horrifically wasteful.  This could just possibly be worthwhile in an age where there isn't much that needs to be electrically powered in a customers home - a few light bulbs, perhaps. In an age where everything requires it,  you'd burn through insanely and almost criminally wasteful amounts of power to get it to customers wirelessly.",eli5

6449vt,why can you still feel the ebb and flow of the waves when lying in bed after swimming in the waves during the day? ,"Your body seeks equilibrium. It is always trying to balance your senses out so that you can tune out normal things, and be alerted to anything in your environment that is different. For example you put an air filter in your bedroom and the first few days you are very aware of the fan noise. After a few weeks your wife turns the air filter off in the middle of the night, and you suddenly wake up because something has changed, it's gone quiet. Your mind learns to filter out the sound of the fan because it's gotten used to it. 

The same thing happens with smells. You put a candle in your room and you smell it really strong, but after a few weeks you don't smell it at all. Then you go on vacation for a week and come back, and you can smell it again. It's one of those reasons why you don't really smell your own home until you've been away from it awhile. 

When you drive in a car, your body gets used to the forces placed on it as you go over bumps and around corners and your mind eventually tunes it out. Your body is also used to not moving around when you get out of the car, so it doesn't feel weird when you're not driving the car. If you get used to driving at a certain speed, your mind and perception of motion will compensate as well, and then if you drive slower, it seems really slow. Doing 70MPH for several hours on a road trip makes going 40mph inside city limits feel like you are crawling because you got used to 70mph. 

However, when you go swimming, your body is bobbing and floating around the water, and your mind is trying to get used to this sensation and filter out the motion. Then later when you are still, your body is still getting used to being still again. If you were to go swimming every day, eventually your body would get used to the transition from water, to land, to bed, and you wouldn't notice feeling waves in your sleep anymore the same way you don't feel weird driving in a car, then sitting in a chair at work. But when you were a child, you probably got a little carsick at times, or got dizzy when getting out of the car. But it was so long ago you forget about it. If you spend a lot of time on a boat and get used to the rocking, it can feel strange to step on dry land again because your body and mind were so used to compensating, they cant suddenly stop doing it, so you have a little trouble walking straight.",eli5

4hwteo,Why does the US Congress hold hearings?,"Congress is empowered with oversight over the executive branches and other forms of government in regards to how they enact the laws they pass.  Hearings are generally performed to conduct an investigation into branches of government, obtain opinions of legislation or to oversee the implementation of a law.

The results of hearings are often informational.  When it comes to investigations the results can be immediate or in the background.  For example, if a branch of government knows that Congress has oversight and the White House orders them to do something illegal or unethical they may think twice about complying. Knowing that hearings take place to investigate or oversee the enactment of law means there is a chance unethical behavior can be thwarted before it even occurs.  Other times, the hearings can bring about information to the public or to Congress that may be beneficial. 

A current example would be the IRS scandal where they were targeting conservative groups to prevent them from acquiring their tax exempt status which provides major political advantages to Democrats as liberal groups had little to no problem receiving donations or funding from people looking to write off the donation on their taxes to spread their message.  An Inspector General blew the whistle of unethical behavior and initially the IRS said it was a mistake that only impacted a handful of rogue agents in a single remote office.  After hearings they learned that this was a lie.  The IRS and administration then stated that they did inappropriately target conservative groups, but it's OK because they accidentally targeted liberal groups in the same fashion and was just a big mixup.  Through hearings with the Inspector General this was also determined to be a lie.  Conservative groups were denied their status at much higher rates and stalled for years while liberal groups were typically rubber stamped or approved rather quickly (even if they had follow-up questions).

The end result of this example is that Lois Lerner, Director of IRS Exempt Organizations, resigned and plead the fifth to protect herself from criminal prosecution.  Congress is now keeping a careful eye on the IRS and trying to get them to fix their issues and biases against conservative groups. 

Another example would be the Fast and Furious case where a border patrol agent was killed by a poorly managed gun walking scheme.  It was determined that the ATF purposely sold guns to the Mexican cartels so that when they were used to commit crimes they could hopefully detect and follow the movements of the cartels.  Hundreds of Mexicans were killed and a US border patrol agent died at the hands of these guns.  Initially the ATF and Eric Holder lied stating that it was a continuation of policies and precedent from the Bush administration.  It was determined that under the Bush administration that whenever guns were intended to be sold to the cartels there was GPS tracking involved and a team of agents ready to make the arrests at the time of the sale, never intending for the guns to actually be sold or change hands.  Under Eric Holder, they were sold without tracking or the intent to make an arrest and let go into the wild for the purpose of being used in violent crimes which could then be used to help gather intelligence for the federal government.  The end result is that Obama protected Holder and department officials from prosecution by exerting ""Executive Privilege"" over the evidence in the case which is not a constitutional right and has historically been used to protect the President from having information go public that could harm or sully their reputation.  In response, Congress held Holder in Contempt over the failure to release documents in response to a subpoena and preventing Congress from providing their constitutional oversight duties. Eventually a judge ruled some documents had to be released, Eric Holder refused to comply and missed deadline after deadline.  Eventually he was going to be in trouble  (possible jail) with this judge who had more teeth so he resigned.  So in this instance, as a result of Congressional hearings the Attorney General was held in Contempt and resigned from his position to save what little face he had left.",eli5

food critics often make reservations using fake names. the only way the restaurant knows who it is is if they are already familiar with the critic's aliases or recognizes them when they walk in the door. 

There are instances where either can call the restaurant and let them know they are coming. For instance a health department official once had issues with a place i worked at sprayer on the dishwasher. They said it didn't hang high enough away from the sink. So they gave the owners 48 hours to fix it and they would come back to inspect it. Also sometimes restaurant owners will invite popular critics or food bloggers to their restaurant as a guest so they will get an article written about them.

1ot3xp,Why are some watches so expensive? ,"You may be surprised to know there are quite a few reasons. Among the most important are craftsmanship, attention to detail, brand pedigree and popularity.


The precious metal cases aside, one of the largest factors is the craftsmanship a high-end watch's movement. The movement is what makes the watch tick. I'll save the complex talk for another article, but what is important to note is that a high-end watch typically uses a hand-made, super-accurate automatic movement. These movements are constructed of very small gears, springs and synthetic jewels to prevent friction. So small, in fact, that even a speck of dust can through off the accuracy of a watch.

If you compared an expensive watch to a to low-end, you would notice that the more expensive of the two is made of much nicer materials and that everything just seems to look and feel right. I know, it sounds so corny, but it's true. The high-quality watch has the right amount of polish, the movement sounds right (the ticks), the crown clicks and functions flawlessly and the band is heavy duty. And I could write a whole article just about the math and styling behind watch dials.

Sure, there is all of this attention to detail, but how can a watch be worth in excess of $10,000. Well, you'd be an idiot to think that watch value is based on those details alone. Many of the best watch brands are rich in history and extremely trusted. When buying a top-tier watch, there is no doubt that you'll be paying a pretty penny to be a part of that history.

Lastly, high demand of expensive watches allow them to be priced much higher than most other watches. If people will buy a watch for thousands of dollars, you can bet your life that a brand will charge that much.",eli5

Australia will feel a lot of pain because commodity sales could drop, china is the world's largest commodity importer.

Imagine 7 race cars speeding down a straight track. Each car has a different color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo or violet.

While all of the cars have the same speed, each car has a different power-train. The indigo car has the strongest power-train; the red car has the weakest. 

As long as the cars are traveling in a straight line, their exact speeds cause them to travel as a tight, single unit. (So tight, in fact, that all 7 cars blend into a single, white color!) 

But then the cars hit a spot in the track that is covered in tar. The tar slows down the cars, but each at a differing rate. The red car with the weakest power-train is slowed the most while the indigo car is slowed the least. The other cars spreading out in between, each according to the car's power-train. 

Now the tight, white blur of cars appears as a continuum of colored cars, spread out in a specific order, determined by how much power or energy each car has.",eli5

34tx43,"Why can't we bring people back to life? I'm actually pretty embarrassed to ask this as I feel like the answer is a pretty simple and basic one. But I've thought about it and... Nothing. It's a stupid question and is probably just a brain fart but I'm not apologizing. I want the answer.

What I'm asking is, even if an organ is destroyed why can't we just replace it? Once a human crosses the line what stops his brain from working again and coming back to life?","It's a matter of cell death. The brain is unique in that it lacks the ability to store glycogen, the storage molecule for glucose as well as an inability to undergo anaerobic metabolism for any length of time. All other tissues can do this which is why you can do things like take a kidney out of a person and put it in another person with no damage to the kidney (as long as it's within a certain window).

Conversely, your brain begins incurring damage after only 2 minutes without blood flow, and just 10 seconds of interrupted flow can cause a loss of consciousness. This is what's happening when people stand up too quickly and get lightheaded. It's a sudden reduction of flow that can cause close to or complete loss of consciousness until the vascularity responds to the sudden decrease in blood flow.

So, this all means that the brain dies very quickly. The only cases where people have been ""brought back to life"" is, famously, people that fall through ice and get submerged in extremely cold water. The decrease in body temperature causes the metabolic rate to decline (8% per degree C) to the point that the brain can withstand ischemia for long periods of time.

Like other organs, once cells die, they simply do not regrow. Meaning that once brain tissue is lost, it's gone! And if we are talking about ""bringing back"" someone from death, all that's really needed is brainstem tissue, which is responsible for ventilation and cardiac stability. The brain stem, unfortunately, follows the same rules as the rest of the brain.

Thus, the  only way to ""bring someone back to life"" would be to prevent the injury in the first place, which we have discussed, or regrow brain tissue. Stem cells offer some hope in the regrowth of neural tissue, but is still flawed.

What makes you ""you"" is a complex series of connection and synapses that have formed over your life. Even if we were to regrow your neural tissue that contribute to higher brain functions, it is unlikely these synapses would remain intact. So, the best you could hope for is a healthy clean slate. ""You"" in the sense that you are thinking of, would be lost forever.",eli5

They can occur in women who suffer from PMS or people who suffer from more serious disorders such an major depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, schizophrenia, or other mood disorders. They can also be caused by thyroid disorders. 

From my limited understanding on mood swings (I'm bipolar and have ADHD) there are neurotransmitters at play, one of them being serotonin. If a person has an abnormal amount of a neurotransmitter, this may result in a mood swing disorder (such as bipolar or ADHD). Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter which is involved in regulating our mood, sleep, and overall emotional state. 

Not eating or changes in your sleep patterns might alter your mood and therefore cause a swing as it would alter your serotonin levels and blood sugar.

86wl6t,why is the perfect ratio of oxygen to hydrogen in rocket combustion 6:1 and not 8:1? ,"I understand why you think that, but the stoichiometric ratio is not the most important consideration when determining propellant and oxidizer ratios.

Burning propellants is most efficient, in terms of heat produced per mass of propellant, at the stoichiometric ratio, which as you know is 8:1 for hydrogen and oxygen, but for a given amount of energy, the momentum is maximized by making the gas molecules as light as possible.  which is why hydrolox engine ideally has a large excess of H2 molecules over H2O and other combustion products, meaning they need to run fuel-rich.

It's different for every single engine, and sometimes varies per engine during the flight. For example, the RS-25, the Space Shuttle main engine, used a 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio, the J2, which powered the 2nd and 3rd stages of the Saturn V used a 5.5:1 ratio that could be adjusted during flight, and the Vulcain 2, which power the Ariane 5, uses a 6.7:1.",eli5

81dq1u,why does notepad on windows save files with an asterisk?,"The asterisk means: ""Replace with your own text.""

Notepad is one of the simplest applications you can get, and is mainly included as the default application for things like viewing readme files, not much more than that.

When you save a file in Windows, and you choose a format from the drop-down list, it gives you not just the name of the format, but the extension or extensions that format uses; for example:

* Batch file (\*.bat; \*.cmd; \*.nt)
* Java source file (\*.java)
* All files (\*.\*)
* ...etc.

The asterisk is simply used as a placeholder for your own text.

Notepad only has the one format in that menu. And, as simple-minded as it is, when you select it in the Save dialogue, it will simply copy the extension into the filename box, placeholder and all.

However, it will also highlight that text. You can simply go ahead and type the file name. If you have \*.txt selected, it will automatically save it as a text file and add the file extension without you having to type it (although you can type it if you want).",eli5

4nzlgq,"why is there always construction that never seems finished? It seems like in many modern countries, construction is just not executed well ","There are many many reasons for this. I'm covering just a few.

A big one is the need for minimal impact. You can't just close a highway for a month while they pave it, people won't be able to get to work for a month, and it will be a total nightmare. So they do it only off peak hours, and move construction off the road during rush hour (possibly wasting 2 hours a day to just move barriers and cones before and after work for the day). Totally closing the highway at all is very often problematic so they do one or two lanes at a time, this gives them less space and work is slower. They also build detours for the spots that they actually need to close the highway (these detours need to be ripped up when it's done). Often you'll see them build part of a new road, temporarily pave it, detour the traffic to the new shoulder, replace the old road, then rip up the shoulder they just paved to pave it smoothly into the new road. It's generally just a lot of work in the interest in keeping more lanes open during construction.

Another big reason is cost and people, your town only has so much money, and the construction company only has so many people. The town is going to spend one years of money on road construction every year, and they are going to do it so the construction companies get one year of work, then nobody has to pay anyone overtime, and the contractors don't end up charging extra for the time they spent looking for extra work. Spreading it out over a year gets the town the best rates and gets the work done with the least amount of people.",eli5

For entirely different reasons, you shouldn't use water on a grease fire.  Grease burns at a temperature much higher than the boiling point of water, and is also less dense than water.  So adding water to a grease fire will cause the water to sink below the grease, and then flash-boil in a burst of steam that flings flaming grease particles in all directions, resulting in a huge fireball, and spreading the fire all around the area.

In short, you have to consider not only the fact that a fire exists, but the circumstances surrounding the fire.  In general, there are [five different classes of fires](_URL_0_):

* Ordinary combustibles:  Things like wood and paper.  Just dump some water on it.  
* Flammable liquid and gas:  Things like pools of gasoline.  A stream of water shouldn't be used, because it can scatter the fuel and spread the fire.  You want to use a dry chemical, CO*_2_*, or foam to smother the fire.
* Electrical: As mentioned above, water is a bad idea.  So is foam, as it can also conduct electricity.  You want to use a dry chemical or CO*_2_* to smother the fire.

This only applies to daytime of course, but I've never understood why we have to look through a really tinted blue sky, but astronauts, satellites, aliens, etc. can see in just fine. Is it a reflection of the ocean, reaction in the atmosphere or something else?","The sky looks blue from earth because the sun is emitting tons of light in all wavelengths. Blue light has a very short wavelength, and thus collides with molecules in the air frequently, scattering. The result is that the blue light appears to be coming from every direction, not just from the sun itself. Light with longer wavelengths is less likely to collide with molecules, so it takes a straight path from the sun to your eye.

As for why the effect is less apparent in space, I'm not entirely sure, but I would guess that it's because there's not a bunch of extremely bright blue light emitting from the earth. Or possibly it's because of the relative thickness of the atmosphere compared to the distance at which the photo is taken?

I am not aware on the details of the proposal but basically, a ""pro"" point would be to prevent people from broadcasting content from somebody else as one's own, and to prevent people from illegally diffusing a full movie on YouTube (you may find that it's not a good point, but it's anyhow, that's the motive of the proposal). 

A bad point would be that free sharing of information could become more difficult. Automatic filters would be in charge on spotting the content targeted by this law and may misinterpret open source stuff (software, documents, etc) and put people releasing these open source stuff in trouble. Collaborative work could also face some issues. Memes could fall into this scope: if there's a meme with some frames from a TV series, it may be targeted.

People tend to speak more about memes because that's a funny angle to talk about the problem and that's likely to make people click the link and find out more, but actually the biggest issue is open source and collaborative contents, which is what people who are standing against this law proposal are trying to protect.",eli5

ag3lrz,"Why can you have a meat stuck in your teeth for a day and when you swallow it you're fine, but if you leave the same meat on the counter for a day and try and eat it, you get sick? ","A good question. Why can you infect milk with bacteria and get yogurt instead of spoiled milk? Why does Italian dry salami keep without refrigeration even though it's inoculated with lactic bacteria for tartness? 

The answer is ""competition"". Food on the countertop is up for grabs by any bacteria, insects, fungus, or animals that can get to it. It can become a battleground as single celled organisms battle it out for who gets the food. Because the war starts with everybody on equal footing. Nobody has an initial advantage. 

When you have food stuck between your teeth though, the bacteria in your mouth have a home field advantage, and can quickly coat the piece of food, similar to inoculating a petri dish with bacteria. Thus by the time other bacteria or fungus can finally make it into your mouth to find the food, there is already an entrenched army of mouth microbes dug in and ready to battle it out. You also have fungus growing in your mouth as well, but it's kept in check by the bacteria, which is kept in check by the fungus. Sometimes when someone takes antibiotics, it kills the bacteria, giving the fungus an advantage, and it reproduces so well you end up with a layer of thrush on your tongue. It's all about balance and playing one side off the other. 

The same happens when you ferment beer or leaven bread. You introduce a preferred organism like yeast, and give it a good place to reproduce rapidly, and it in turn will defend the food from other microbes. 

Don't forget that penicillin is a drug derived from a strain of fungus that had developed it in order to fight off bacteria that competed for the same food and habitat. Microorganisms fight each other all of the time for food and shelter.",eli5

3swnfv,"How did Europe become ""richer"" than other continents?","This isn't a question to be answered in one small text box. There are many contributing factors. As a World History teacher, I'll just give you a few of the main reasons.

1.) Great Britain was the first to industrialize. Once they moved from the cottage industry to the factory system they gained immense masses of wealth. The Industrial Revolution quickly spread to surrounding European nations and the United States.

2.) Needing more natural resources to feed their factories, the Western European nations went on an imperialistic bombardment, mostly in Africa. This continued to feed them with more natural resources while keeping the Africans down. The United States was doing the same in the Caribbean.

3.) Due to mass competition among European nations they've been at war since the Greek Empire. Europe is a very small space relative to the Americas, Africa, and Asia so people lived closer to other groups of people.

7u1tx0,Why would a 100-petawatt laser prove E=mc^2; and how could light possibly be transformed into matter?,"I’m not a scientist but I am a popular science geek. I’ll do my best. Near as I can tell they’re trying to focus so much energy into a tiny area that the universe breaks. E=MC^2 means that all matter, stuff in the universe, is just another form of energy. Light is a form of energy too. 

Black holes form when so much mass is squeezed into a tiny area that the universe breaks and the laws of physics get really weird. But as said before, mass and energy are really the same thing. Scientists believe that black holes can be made by focusing enough light into a tiny area. That’s what they’re attempting to do here.  

As for the rest, the bit about turning light into matter, I really couldn’t say for certain, that’s a level of quantum nastiness that a popular scientist nerd like me has trouble grasping. They mentioned that it’s the reverse of a nuclear weapon. That part I can explain. A nuclear weapon works by converting matter into energy. When a nuke goes off a small percentage of its mass is destroyed and turned into pure energy, creating the explosion . A small amount of mass makes a huge amount of energy. Most of that energy is given off as light/heat. Therefore these scientists want to do the opposite, take pure energy (light) and turn it into mass. The mechanism for doing that is well beyond me.",eli5

nfquz,Why do different countries have different electrical plugs? and whats is up with 220/240v in europe and 120v in the US?,"Keep in mind that there's no ""right"" way to design a plug (even though there are wrong ways) - a lot of different designs are just as good as each other.  For example, compare AA and 9-volt batteries - they're completely different but they do the same thing.

When they discovered electricty, they didn't have the Internet, telephone or radio.  Trans-oceanic letters had to be delivered by boat  &  it was *very* slow.  They also didn't get all their electronics from Chinese factories - everything was built by hand or small steam-powered machines in the country (or at least continent) that it was going to be used.

So some guy in America build a power plant and wires up his city one way while, at the same time, some other guy is building a power plant in Europe.  They couldn't really work together to make sure the systems were compatible and, really, there was no point in doing so at the time.

1sfg9p,Why don't all NFL stadiums have domes? Wouldn't that ensure that there are no advantages or disadvantages with adverse weather conditions? Don't dome stadium teams get screwed over when they visit an outdoor team and it snows? Wouldn't all teams prefer to have perfect conditions no matter what?,"They're more expensive and don't add much revenue. A dome also requires turf, and there's a big debate between the effects of natural grass and artificial turf. There were no domed stadiums until 1962, a few NFL stadiums predate it, so requiring every team to use a dome is unrealistic. Plus it's tough to upgrade a domed stadium to add extra luxury boxes (where most ticket revenue comes from) or seats. That being said, 4 of the last 6 new NFL stadiums have retractable roofs, so they are becoming more common. 

Also, part of the culture in football is playing every game regardless of weather conditions; if it's not a natural disaster (hurricane, tornado, lightning), you play--rain, sleet, or snow. Big snow games like today's Lions-Eagles matchup are one of the reasons people love the sport. You don't get that experience in a dome.",eli5

34ga8f,Why are there so many extravagantly poisonous animals in Australia? ,"Australia is large, but it also became isolated except to certain bird and aquatic species. At certain times there would have been land bridges or more shallow seas between SE Asia and the continent. 

Poison has a role in any ecosystem, it just depends on what the creature is and it's survival strategy. 

Would you believe one of the biggest problems that Australia faces with poisonous critters are toads? And they aren't even Australian toads; I'm talking about the cane toads. It's an invasive species introduced ironically as a pest control measure and it's killing the native wild life. Native animals eat the toads and then get sick and die. 

As for more traditional venemos animals, it's all about competition and survival. If you are a snake that has no venom, you are more likely to be injured when hunting, and to become another animals meal. On the flip side, it's metabolically taxing to create venom so you need to eat more or be smaller than you'd be if you didn't make it. 

Then there's the really weird cases, like the duck billed platypus. It has venomous spines but it doesn't use them for hunting. Instead they are used in reproductive rights to ward off competing males. 

Many of the venomous creatures are also insects and arachnids which tend to be venomous elsewhere in the world as well. You see Australia is a big continent and it has several different ecosystems and climates. So already there is going to be a much larger population of organisms than other islands, and because of that isolation I mentioned earlier, it was removed from some of the changes that underwent animals in the rest of the world. Species that would have out competed native ones, were unable to compete because they were isolated from invading. This allowed marsupials for instance to keep a toehold in the food chain long after that type of survival mechanism became dated in the rest of the world. 

It kind of makes you wonder what kind of animal and insect fossils we will find underneath all that ice in Antarctica doesn't it? It's the only place left on the planet that is likely to have even weirder animals than Australia, well fossils of them anyway.",eli5

And why are fossil fuels a finite source if it comes from organic material that has existed since then, and is still around today? Shouldn't past organic material since the dinosaurs be (however slowly) continuously converting into crude oil and other fossil fuels such as the dinosaurs did?","I'll answer your second question first. 

The living things that are alive today will someday die and turn into Oil.  However, this process takes millions of years.  Simply put, we are using the oil MUCH faster than it can be created at. While certainly things are still living and dying, the time it takes to turn them into crude oil is far to long for it to replenish what we are taking. 

Remember, the oil in the ground right now is hundreds of millions of years worth of dead things.  And we will likely consume all of them in a few hundred years (between when we started drilling to when we might run out).

What makes his paintings so special? 

","I'm no art expert, but in my opinion his style was substantially different than most of the impressionists. When you look at a Renoir, Monet, Manet, Pissaro, etc. you see an essentially ""realistic"" scene, but one which has been created through unusual techniques (such as pointillism). 
  
Van Gogh takes this a step farther.  Quite often (but not always) his paintings do not really show something that would be described as ""realistic"".  He instead depicts the concept of a thing, rather than rendering a literal image of the thing.  You can squint at most impressionist paintings and imagine that you are looking at a realistic painting; not true with many Van Gogh's. 
   
I think that in some ways you could describe him as the bridge from impressionism to true abstract art.

6iysdg,Why is a kilogram based on a physical object located in France? ,"Firstly, it isn't. I'll get back to this in a second.

Brief, simplified, history of units of measure. Oldest measurement units were based off of stuff like body parts and varied widely. Next step, you have your official unit based on some arbitrary object that you keep safe and can set your scales or rulers or whatnot to. Like, say, rod that you've declared to be the definition of one foot long. Problem is that there's always the risk that your standard can get lost, broken, etc. Every time you measure it, you'll be damaging it slightly. It'll wear out.

The gram was originally defined as the weight of one cubic centimeter of water at just above freezing (""the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of the hundredth part of the metre, and at the temperature of melting ice""). This is a huge improvement over older styles of measure.

That's cool and all, but you still need some sort of practical, physical objects to set and calibrate scales with.

That ""official"" kilogram block isn't quite like that ""official foot"" from above. Instead of being just arbitrarily chosen thing, it was machined to match the definition of a kilogram as best as our technology allows. It's a very accurate and precise example of a kilogram not the standard that the kilogram is based on. Cool thing is that if it gets destroyed, it's not that big of a deal. We can make a new one. We can have multiples that are all equally ""official"".",eli5

Most soda-type energy drinks are also clear (Red Bull, Monster, etc) and they definitely have caffeine. Pepsi and Coke have it added because colas have always been mild stimulants. Coca Cola got it's name from two of its key ingredients - the Cola nut (which contains caffeine) and the same plant that they use to make cocaine. When food and beverages had to start listing ingredients, that stopped, so they added more caffeine to give people the same lift they were used to.

Manufacturers leave it out of some sodas (or make caffeine-free versions of colas) for a variety of reasons. Many parents prefer not to give their kids caffeine. Many people don't drink caffeine later in the day as it makes it hard for them to sleep. Some people also get very jittery from caffeine, so they avoid it in general.

ztvjx,"Why won't Mitt Romney release his tax returns? I don't get it. I mean he can easily shut up the liberal media if he just released it. 

Why is he choosing not to reveal it when most politicians have done this in the past including his father?

I know we can't know for sure, but what are current theories on why he won't release it? Why won't the IRS release it since public office should require such a thing to prevent tax-evaders from running for office?","Look back on the past two elections:

2008: McCain only released 2 years of tax returns.  He didn't get heat for it.  Nobody cared.  He was rich, and was attacked for being rich.  Remember his wife's comment about not knowing how many houses they owned?  But only releasing two years of tax returns didn't matter.

2004: Kerry wouldn't release all of his Vietnam service records.  He was pounced on, with the attitude ""Obviously he has something to hide.""  The attack worked, it weakened his support.  He lost.  Everyone still believed he was hiding something.  Later, Kerry later released all the remaining service records.  Turns out, Kerry wasn't lying at all.  He didn't have anything to hide, and he was telling the truth all along.  He said he didn't release them earlier because he felt it would be wrong to cave to opponents' requests.  

Now here we are in 2012, apparently having forgotten recent history and created new standards. 

I'm going to state something anathema to Reddit.  Perhaps Romney is...telling the truth.  What if he doesn't want to release them because he believes in some privacy?  That is most definitely a possibility.  But Reddit seems to reject it. 

The ultimate answer is, we just don't know.  Only Romney himself knows.  All this speculation about what he *may* be trying to hide is the same crap that created problems in 2004.  And if you think we should be upset about it now, why didn't we care in 2008?",eli5

I'd like to hope that eventually we can work toward cultural compatibility, much and such as if you live in the EU you can travel and work in any country there and cross borders without controls.

1, We have inherent racism in the system, if you're not white you're a immigrant. If you're from a first world country you're an ex-pat.

2, Wealth inequality. We like our way of life and don't want to dilute it, so try to avoid letting poor people into the west. Which goes hand in hand with;

3, Living condition disparity. The majority of the worlds population lives below the poverty line, and in some horrific places. With open borders we could realistically expect migration to overwhelm the countries being migrated too. They would collapse under the sheer numbers involved.

4, Cultural fear; we fear that if we let everyone in, then all of a sudden we'll lose out cultural identities, as an extreme Bin Laden will be voted in as president and sharia law will take over Denmark.. There's natural xenophobia throughout the world, particularly when dealing with alternative cultures.

If we could resolve those issues we'd be well on the way. They're pretty big issues though.

a68eyz,"Despite the Wall Street Crash of 1929, What other factors caused the Great Depression? So I was doing some digging in our economy's history and found the Great Depression of 1929-1939 and saw that every website talked about the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Surely there had to be other factors that contributed to the Great Depression and not just Wall Street Crash, what were those other factors?","It depends on who you ask as to whether the Wall Street Crash on Black Tuesday was a cause of the depression or a symptom of the depression. People are still debating it to this day.

The two main schools of thought about what caused the depression are the demand-driven theories or Keynesian theories, and the monetarist theories.

The Keynesian theories argue that the depression was caused by a loss of confidence in the stock market, which led to underconsumption, which led to a fall in stock prices and company value, which led to layoffs, which led to *more* underconsumption and *even lower* sales for companies who saw even *lower* stock prices... etc etc until 1/4 of the country was unemployed and prices of everything were incredibly low because despite the supply being low, nobody could buy anything because everyone was broke.

This panic also caused people to lose faith in their banks, and try to withdraw all of their money. Because banks would invest money they held, they didn't have the funds to cover everyone pulling out and closing their account like that, so many banks completely shut down as well.

The monetarists contend that there were policy decisions made by the Federal Reserve that turned what would have been a normal recession into a downward spiral.",eli5
6uung9,"Even in very multiracial areas, why is online dating so white?","So not to be too controversial, a lot of this is coming from friends explanations (they are from a variety of Asian nations: China, Korea, Indonesia, etc. and some Nigerian and Ethiopian natives), a lot of very tradition-oriented individuals have other channels to meet others.

This is not just arranged marriages, but sometimes families help their relatives meet other people who are similar. Or if they are not interested in someone who is of European descent, they may not be drawn to using these apps as (as you mentioned) their largely European base may not be appealing to them so they shy away from these apps. 

This has credence in the US, where interracial dating is on the rise but it is not something that is commonplace so when you look at older/first generation immigrants here, they are sometimes apprehensive to dating outside their race. Again, lending to the idea that they may not want to use a largely European dating app.

Kids fight on the playground and play games that revolve around violence without having to be shown it. But you don't see kids playing games revolving around sex, so it's safe to assume that they aren't naturally ready for it. Kids kiss and stuff, but it's nothing *sexual* necessarily. And as a society, we have a responsibility to make sure our kids have as smooth of a transition into maturity as possible.

I don't feel safe around my friends and family and pets worried I'll stab them or something. I'm not crazy, at least I don't think so, so why is this happening? Last night I had a nightmare in which I crushed my kitten. I woke up crying and screaming and went to the computer to ask this. I would never kill my family or friends or pets.","You can't take your dreams at face value.  They are symbolic communication from your subconscious.  And ignore the books like '10,000 Dreams Interpreted'.  The only person who can interpret your dream is you.  So, what can you do.

You can start using your dreams.  The first thing to do is keep a dream diary.  Write down your dreams every morning.  Try to recall as much detail as you can.  And feel the feelings they give you.  Allow yourself to intuit what they mean.  Logic doesn't work, as such.  Suppose you spend a whole day picking fruit as a job.  That night you dream about picking fruit, with some other elements.  This is just your subconscious integrating your day's experience into your memory network.  On the other hand, suppose you have a fear of dogs.  And you met a dog today, and were very afraid.  And in your dream, you meet a dog, and at first it is dangerous, then later allows you to pet it, and it licks your hand.  That would seem to suggest you should be less fearful of dogs, that it is time to put your fear aside.  In dreams, almost always, every element that you interact with is a facet of yourself.

There are many books about dreaming, and interpreting dreams.  A simple one that I remember as being good is 'Creative Dreaming' by Patricia Garfield PhD.

The fact that you kill your loved ones in your dream does not mean you would do that in real life.  Write down the dream you had last night about crushing your kitten.  As you are writing it, and recalling all the details, allow your mind to free associate (that means let your mind wander, don't consciously direct it).  It might be that a scene, or a voice, or a feeling will come to you.  Follow it, and do the same.  By following the chain of associations to its beginning, you can find the source of the dream, and understand it with your rational and conscious mind.  It can be completely different than the actual content of the dream would suggest.  To do this well, you have to trust yourself.  Don't try to influence the meaning, just let it happen.

One interpretation of your dream *might* be that the kitten represents your playfulness and curiosity.  And you are killing it because you aren't nurturing it.",eli5

Is the overall shape always fixed or can it change due to a different set of numbers?,"The image that you are looking at when you refer to the 'shape' of the set is actually a complex coordinate plane (both real and imaginary numbers). Every single point on the plane has been plugged into a particular iterative equation (the same function repeated over and over again using the previous solution as the variables for the next repeat - commonly referred to in school and a NOW-NEXT equation). When you do this, some of those points have defined limits (i.e. the solutions will eventually converge on a particular value, and others do not (i.e. the solutions expand to positive or negative infinity).

The 'shape' of the set is the 'outline' of all the points that have limits.

Your question about it changing based on numbers is off the mark because the image itself represents all possible changes in the numbers. A specific number is just one point on the image, either inside the shape (if it converges on a limit and is therefore part of the set), or outside the shape (if it has no limit and is therefore outside the set.",eli5

1kwwrl,Why the hell do downloads slow down when they get to 99%? It's almost like they don't want to have to slam on their brakes.,"Depends on what you're downloading from where, but a few possible reasons you might see this (and sometimes more than one reason is in effect at a time):

* The progress bar guessed, but its guess was a little bit off - in fact sometimes you'll see the opposite, where it jumps quickly at the end because it guessed longer than it actually took.  But you probably don't notice and remember that as much :)  Anyway, when you're nearing the end, there's less and less guessing, and more and more getting to exactly the right time.

* Some file transfer methods may send larger packets or groups of packets in the middle of a file, and send smaller ones (or smaller groups) near the end when there's less data left to send.

* Often some packets get lost or mangled by the network, and have to be re-sent.  This happens throughout the download.  Let's say for every ten packets the sender sends, 9 get through okay and 1 fails somehow and then the sender re-sends it.  Well, when you're in the middle of the file, there are always more packets to send, and some are always getting through.  But near the end, most pieces of the file have already gotten through, and now it really needs to send just those last few pieces that haven't been received properly yet.  It can't gain time by sending other pieces while it waits for those, because those other pieces have already gotten through and it would do no good to send them again.

For the last point, imagine that you have to fill a solid square on a piece of paper with a color.  First you can just quickly swish your brush all over the square and fill up most of it rather quickly.  At the end, though, swishing your brush won't help you fill the last few missing pieces in more quickly.  You can still cover a lot of space with your brush quickly, but most of that space you're covering has already been painted, so it doesn't matter.  You have to carefully fill the few remaining un-painted spots.",eli5

5me57w,Doesn't Guaranteed Basic Income just cause crazy inflation? Is there any evidence that GBI actually works in the long term?,"Why would it result in inflation? Inflation would only occur if you increased the total money supply too rapidly compared to the total value of goods and services available in the country. If you just redistribute some of it (presumably you transfer the money from other government programs) then there shouldn't be inflation.

The two main causes of inflation aside from printing new money are from increased demand outpacing production or from increased costs of production. I don't think providing people a GBI would cause such an increased demand for goods and services that the demand would outpace production. At least I've never seen any studies or numbers that indicate that. There's also no reason GBI would increase production costs. Increasing minimum wage might, but that's because the wages are paid out by businesses.

Edit: Of course it depends on the amount, but I'm assuming something reasonable like $5k - $20k. If you give such a high GBI that people quit their jobs en masse or the government has to print money or cancel important programs to pay for it you'll have inflation and other issues. It should also be noted that Alaska already has a GBI of $2000/year, but there are quite a few things different about Alaska from most places like it's small population, climate, and location.",eli5

edit: Thanks for the answers guys","You've asked some good questions here, but I don't think the last two have actually been answered. 
 >  
 >  doesn't blood circulate through the body at such high speeds that a specific vein wouldn't make a difference? and also, why blood from in the vein?

There are cases where blood needs to be drawn from an artery to see how well a person's blood is carrying oxygen. This is to get what's called an [arterial blood gas](_URL_0_) test and I've heard it's more painful and difficult than drawing blood from a vein, so doctors avoid requesting them unless necessary. 

The blood in arteries is full of oxygen on its way to parts of your body that need it. After oxygen is dropped off at those tissues, the deoxygenated blood returns to your heart through veins on its way back to the lungs for reoxygenation. The stuff doctors are testing for in a normal blood draw isn't used up and replenished every cycle like oxygen, so you're right that it basically doesn't matter where in the circuit the blood draw comes from otherwise. 

So it's easiest to draw blood from a vein and, as people have already explained, the fold of your arm is just a great place to poke you since it's accessible in a clothed patient and the veins are easy to see. A patient's neck is even more likely to be uncovered, but medical types get very nervous about brain infections and other bad stuff up there.",eli5

But if you get a bug bite on your face or hands you can immediately hit it away without even looking? It all has to do with the way your nervous system is set up. 

Take a look at [this image](_URL_0_) (kinda NSFW? but it's Anatomy related). This is Homunculus Man. Unlike you and me, he isn't constructed according to normal sizes. He's constructed based on how much priority the brain gives to certain body parts. Your brain (and spinal cord) is constantly receiving signals from all over your body about what it feels (sensory) and giving signals about what your body should do (motor).

Your brain gets a lot of sensory information from your hands because there are a hell of a lot of ""sensory receptors"" in a small area on your hand. The smaller the body part on the Homunculus, the fewer receptors on that body part that are sent to your brain.

Here's a little experiment you can try. Grab a couple of toothpicks. Use them to poke an area on your lower back. Can you tell from the poke just how many toothpicks you're being poked with? Probably not. Now do the same thing on your hand or face. You should be able to distinguish all the different toothpick points from each other thanks to all those receptors.

Having an itch that you ""can't find"" is a result of your brain not getting all the information it needs. All those receptors in your hand and face allow your brain to pinpoint an itch, but without all those receptors in other parts of the body, there's just no way it can find the source as accurately.",eli5

Wouldn't that mean that it's worth 1.23 GBP? Why does it matter if it is 57 dollars to a *whatever*? Wouldn't the arbitrary price just change to match the inherent and/or assumed value of the toy? Why are exchange rates so fussed about?,"> Wouldn't the arbitrary price just change to match the inherent and/or assumed value of the toy? Why are exchange rates so fussed about?

Well exchange rates is difficult to explain without a basic understanding of economics, but you're right in that something that costs 2 U.S. dollars is worth 1.23 GBP, what isn't intuitively obvious is how these prices are determined.  The exchange rate between the U.S. and say China is determined by the trade between the two countries.  The mechanics of this can be demonstrated with supply and demand but it's hard to explain over the internet.

To answer your question as to why they're so fussed about, imagine you're China and 30% of your economy is derived from your ability to export goods.  Well what happens to you if your currency suddenly appreciates and becomes relatively more expensive than it was?  Well it means that your exports have become much more expensive and now you're not exporting as much.

A more common scenario is what happened during the 90's, if you're a country like Thailand and lots of investment starts flowing into your country, you might start importing more, and also borrowing more money (with an expectation of future funds being available to cover your debt).  This is what happened to Thailand, but they tried to ""peg"" their currency, or maintain a fixed exchange rate against a strong currency like the U.S.D. and they're fiscal/monetary policies put a lot of pressure on their currency to depreciate and when it eventually did, it happened really quickly and they were in a very tight spot because the rapid depreciation meant that the burden of their debt became greater and the cost of their imports had also become much more expensive.",eli5

6id8y9,"Why would I want my food to be antibiotic-free? I'm seeing a lot of advertisements for antibiotic free chicken/beef. Antibiotics are important to humans for resisting infections and staying healthy, so why would I want the animals I eat to go without them?","Farmers really want to try to make sure their herds/flocks grow big and strong as quickly as possible.  They want their animals to stay healthy too.  So, to do that, they have for years given small doses of antibiotics to their animals to keep them from getting sick.  Food safety advocates and medical professionals are worried though that this could make humans sicker in the long run.

Antibiotics are great!  They keep us from dying from stuff like tuberculosis or staph infections.  But they don't always kill all the bad bacteria when we take them.  They basically give our immune system a huge advantage in fighting infection.  But some of the bad germs survive and become that much stronger.  The big fear is that you giving farm animals antibiotics when they don't need them, it could make some human diseases harder to treat down the line.  We already know that TB and staph have some really nasty drug resistant strains out in the wild, and we don't want more of them.

We're also not quite sure how these antibiotics given to animals that give us meat or milk might affect us.  There are lots of rumors that the antibiotics given to animals might be doing things to humans.  We're still not sure if these things are good or bad, or if they're wide spread.  Scientists are still figuring it out but some think it might be affecting how quickly people are growing or that it might be killing the good bacteria in our bodies.

Environmental activists also worry that these medicines might be getting into ground water and affecting the ecosystem.

With all these concerns, and with people wondering more and more where their food comes from, grocers have started slapping ""antibiotic free!"" labels on their food packaging.  It was a smart move: ""organic"" and ""all natural"" foods have become very popular and the labeling makes people feel better about what they're buying.

In the end, though, we don't really know if these farm practices are really as bad as we worry they are.  The concerns we have are very real, and very valid, but scientists need to do a lot more research into how what the farmers do affect the rest of us.  There is also very little oversight into the way food is marketed and labeled, so we don't always know if the foods labeled as ""antibiotic free"" are really as free of antibiotics as they claim.  Mostly, it's good marketing.  We buy the ""antibiotic free"" meat and milk because we feel better about ourselves when we do.

Michael Pollan's ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" covers a lot of this (where our food comes from and how farm animals are raised) if you're  interested.",eli5

24rx7h,Why does the Dual Core CPU in my laptop/desktop need big heat sinks and active fans to stay cool but the 2.5GHz Quad Core CPU in my phone requires nothing and doesn't melt my phone? Just as the title. I was wondering why the really high end CPUs in phone don't need a buttload of cooling despite having more power than my current laptop (which is often running fans.) ,"The number of cores has nothing to do with heat. Nor is the frequency. Modern multi core high frequency CPUs generate far less heat than their slower, single core predecessors.

What's the power consumption of these opposing processors? How large are their dies? How many transistors? And what features are available on the architecture?

Older CPUs have larger wiring, which uses more electricity. They're simply less efficient. There are several motivations to push integrated circuitry to ever smaller sizes, and one of them is energy efficiency.

More transistors consume more energy. If you look at a desktop processor under a microscope, and locate the spot on the die dedicated to multiplication, it'd be a tiny spec. Compare that to a GPU, where given the same space, most of that processor is dedicated to multiplication. This analogy holds true of your desktop vs phone CPU, these processors are functionally equivalent, in that they're both Turing Complete, but one can be much larger than the other, and have more circuitry dedicated to performing work. Where multiplication can take 8 clock ticks on your desktop CPU, your GPU can do it in 1. While your phone CPU can perform some operation in some period of time, the larger desktop CPU can do it in less.

Also consider features of these processors. Just because you have 2 vs 4 cores, the dual core processor can do more work, because there is a thing called the instruction pipeline. This is a queue of instructions that are at various stages of completion. I don't know how many stages your phone has, *if any*, but if you're running an old dual core, I believe each core has 22. And you also have hyper threads, which are additional, parallel pipelines within a core.

Another feature of your cellphone processor is that it almost certainly has energy save features; it can turn off segments of the processor that aren't in use to save energy. This just wasn't a priority at Intel in their Core Duo line.

And that cellphone processor is a huge compromise. It's not a desktop, you're not going to be cracking encryption or computing weather models, it only has to be good enough and fast enough to give you a responsive interface on your phone. So any compromise between its performance and energy conservation, they went the bare minimum on performance.",eli5

You may have heard of this. It is your bodies response to what you perceive as harm or high stress. To make the fight or flight response most effective, your body needs to void so you won't have to when the perceived stressful event occurs.

Why dont we spend time/money building thick walls to defend against everything, instead of designing a cannon (vaccine) that can kill Japanese, horse mounted samurai, with long bows that fire poison darts on fire (specific virus)? ","Immune system works in two ways: specific and not specific.

*Not specific:* These are the ""walls"" you talk about that defend against everything. Say the enemy wear red hats. You know that if you see a guy wearing a red hat, you gotta kill him. That's pretty much what the non-specific part does. Bacteria have markers on their surface. If they see that, they kill it. Easy, right?

*Specific:* It's not that easy. What do you think the enemy will do? They learn to stop wearing red hats. Over time, some bacteria and viruses have learned to trick our body to into getting past these basic defences. What do we do now? We have a list of all the enemy names and pictures of their faces. If you see a guy, and he is called Mr. Enemy, then you gotta kill him. If you see a guy and you think he's alright, and then he hits you, you make a note of his face and name and then kill him when he comes back. That why you don't get chickenpox twice. You body now knows that Mr Chickenpox is bad. 

So to answer your question, we don't really have a way to improve the non-specific immunity. The red hat rules works, but not all the time, and bacteria and viruses will find work arounds.

2158me,Why is restoring a painting acceptable/preferred? Wouldn't painting over parts of a painting with what you think might have been there potentially change the painting from it's original and 'ruin' the painting?,"There's still some debate over what is and isn't preferred when restoring something. With some antiques people insists that the patina of dirt is important. With some art people insist that any parts replaced should be done so that they give the impression of the original while clearly being different. But in some cases people feel that it's important to be able to experience the original.

The general rules are:

* Make any change reversible
* Don't do anything that would damage the original
* Don't invent things or fill in gaps unless you are sure what was there originally

Restoring a painting might involve:

* Attaching the painting to a second backing to fix and rips in the canvas from and to stop new ones from appearing
* Removing the existing dirt
* Applying a glue to secure any loose flecks of paint, or possibly filler to larger cracks
* Examining the paint flecks in detail to figure out what the original looked like
* Repainting the damaged sections carefully to match the colour, shine, and brush stroke direction (this is generally done with a tiny brush and a light watercolour paint)

64fq06,"Why were 1.44mb floppy disks the standard? why are they all 1.44mb? can they get larger? if higher volumes are unreliable, why is this? ",">  Why were 1.44mb floppy disks the standard? why are they all 1.44mb? can they get larger? if higher volumes are unreliable, why is this?

It was a physical limitation of the drive hardware of the day. 

Even worse: before 1.44 Mb floppy disks, the same 3.5"" floppy disk only held 720 Kb. Eventually the hardware became able to read/write on both sides of the disk, hence 1.44 Mb. 

But before _that_, we all had to use 5.25"" floppy disks, and those only held 360 Kb . . . if they were double-sided! Single-sided they only held a measly 180 Kb. 

As you can see, the physical size doesn't matter (the earlier 5.25"" disks held less than the later, smaller 3.5"" disks). What mattered was how many sectors and blocks the drive hardware was capable of writing to or reading from the disk. The constraint was the hardware, not the little slip of magnetic media in the disk. 

As hardware improved, the need for floppy disks to become better disappeared, so not one invested in improving the technology. Instead floppies were replaced by hard disk drives and optical drives (CD and later DVD). Hard drives had gotten much smaller, so they could be installed internally in computers. (For comparison, my first external HDD in 1984 was about the size of a Playstation 3, and it stored a massive 10 Mb -- yes, megabytes -- of data!) And of course as soon as writable CDs came along (and later writable DVDs), the floppy disk was dead.

TLDR; Technologically, it might have been possible to create a floppy disk that stored a lot more than 1.44 Mb, but before that happened the format was replaced by faster, more efficient alternatives.",eli5

91ukav,"Reposting my question from AskScience Why is a peanut allergy much more common than say, an apple allergy, and why is a peanut allergy much more deadly than other allergies?","An allergic reaction is when your immune system attacks something that is not a harmful invader. The symptoms that you feel are things that your body is doing to try to protect you. For example, hives make you itchy, which make you scratch, which usually removes harmful stuff. Your body's not super smart about it, but it usually works.

Your immune system works by identifying things based on shape and then attacking those things.

The ""things"" in these situations are proteins. For example, your body might detect the flu by recognizing the shape of a protein on its shell. 

The proteins in foods that people are commonly allergic to just so happen to be shaped like the proteins on harmful stuff. Your immune system sees the food protein and thinks that its actually the protein on the harmful thing and so it tries to kill it.

In the case of peanuts, a specific protein in peanuts looks very similar to a protein also found on the skin of an intestinal parasite that used to be very common. Your body has most likely never been exposed to the real thing, and so it's easy for it to make that mistake.

This is why these types of allergies are far less common in undeveloped parts of the world. They lack the sanitation that prevents the spread of the harmful thing, and so they get exposed to the harmful thing, and so their bodies are less likely to get confused and attack the food protein. 

Funnily enough, this is also why you can mostly cure a peanut allergy by giving yourself intestinal worms.",eli5

lawyr,Can someone explain how Solid State Drives work and why they're better than Hard Drives? ,"Hard drives store data by spinning giant magnetic platters around, and using a read/write head to read and/or write the magnetic orientation of tiny little bits of the platters, which it interprets as 1s and 0s.  They can provide an enormous amount of storage for a very low price.

So what's the problem with hard drives?  They're slow.  Like really slow.  A modern hard drive can take up to a few milliseconds to find a file, because the read/write head has to move from one part of the platter to another.  A few thousandths of a second doesn't sound like a lot, until you consider that 1) a modern processor can execute a million or more instructions in the time it takes a hard drive to make a single jump, and 2) you might have to make dozens or even hundreds of jumps for non-consecutive data.  And that doesn't even account for the time it takes to actually *read* the file - which is dependent on how fast the platter can spin, how densely packed the individual bits on a platter are, how far away the file is physically placed from the center of the drive, etc.

Ultimately, hard drives are *the* bottleneck to modern computers.

Solid State Drives (SSDs) are basically glorified jump drives - a bunch of flash memory chips hooked up to each other so that they appear to a computer as one giant place to put stuff, just like a hard drive.  Unlike hard drives, flash memory suffers from none of the problems that plague the speed of hard drives, because they're not dependent on moving, mechanical parts.  Finding any given piece of data takes the same amount of time for any data in any location.

The end result is that your processor spends *way* less time waiting on an SSD to feed it data than it would waiting for a hard drive.  Where this is especially evident is in loading times.  Your PC starts in seconds instead of minutes.  Programs load in maybe one second instead of ten.  [These guys at Samsung](_URL_0_) chained together a couple dozen SSDs to a system that was otherwise not terribly far removed from a modern mid-tier gaming computer, and ended up with a system that could load *the entire Microsoft Office suite in half a second.*^1

*That* is how much power your computer already has in it, and how much mechanical hard drives are simply holding it back.

Now, that's not to say SSDs don't have their own set of quirks.  All SSDs are driven by a chip called a controller, and the type of controller ultimately dictates how fast the drive runs compared to others.  Writing data to an SSD eventually slows it down some because file deleting doesn't work quite the same way as it does on hard drives.  Things like that.  But even the slowest modern SSD will leave the fastest mechanical hard drive in the dust.

If you want an SSD breakdown that's more ELI~15, check out [The SSD Anthology](_URL_1_) over at Anandtech.

I spilled boiling water over my hand today, and it was not pleasant. The real pain came after 1-3 minutes, why? For what I understand it doesnt hurt first when you touch it because your hand ""resists"" it like a water droplet on a pan, but it takes a while after you have touched something hot to really create pain, why?

Is it shock or? Cant be shock because its just for 1-3 mintues too, so what is it?


(Got rid of the pain by numbing my arm with stopping the blood flow, I know its not good but it hurt really bad).","The first bit of pain that you felt when the water touched your hand was pain signals being sent by the nerve endings at the points in your skin that were directly affected. Those nerves felt the boiling hot water and said ""Ouch, that hurts."" That pain makes your brain immediately react, probably by letting go of whatever you were holding.

The burn causes damage not only to the skin, but also to the nerve endings (and other stuff) underneath the skin. That damage needs to be repaired, so your brain sends blood carrying all sorts of ""supplies"" to the area. Your body begins to use the supplies to rebuild the damaged tissue from below. That process (which can take a few minutes to occur) causes inflammation in the area.

The inflammation is actually what causes most of the pain. The inflamed area presses against other surrounding nerves, causing them to send pain signals to your brain. Additionally, one thing included with the other supplies that is sent to the area is a set of chemicals that actually cause nerve endings to send pain signals automatically. This pain isn't a bad thing, though. The pain makes you keep that area safe until your body has had time to repair enough of the damaged tissue.

Once enough of the tissue has been repaired so the area has regained structural support, the inflammation decreases and the pain starts to go down. The new tissue is built underneath the damaged tissue, using any parts of the damaged tissue that might still be functional enough. Anything that is too damaged to reuse is simply pushed upward. You see that as a blister if there is enough of it, otherwise it may just look like dead skin.

Hope that helps.",eli5

On the other hand: So do the terrorists. Now that they know how the NSA is operating, they can maneuver around them without being seen.","You are 100% correct in both of your assessments.  Anyone who says that it will have no effect on the ability to catch the terrorists are ling to themselves.

However many people believe that catching terrorists at any cost is not how we as a people should operate.  While catching terrorists IS important maintaining our system of liberties and ensuring the government does not violate laws is more important than maintaining our own safety.

Many people believe that the steps that the NSA has taken are the first steps to living in a totalitarian state.  These people believe freedom is worth more than safety.  Therefore they are willing to sacrifice safety, in the form of catching those who would harm us, in exchange for maintaining the freedoms that the country was founded on.

37mn22,"Why does mentally handicapped people often look unattractive? I'm not trying to mock mentally challenged people, but ever since elementary school when looking at the different school class photos I've noticed that the special classes always seem to have a significantly larger amount of ugly people. Is there something I'm missing? It seems so illogical that their handicap should have anything to do with their appearance.
I feel bad for asking this but I honestly can't get it out of my head. ","Couple of reasons.

1) Many of the mentally ill are that way due a genetic disease, which often also includes physical effects (such as Down Syndrome, which is the disease I'm guessing the ones you saw in your year book suffer from). 

2) The mentally handicapped are less capable of taking care of themselves, both in terms of health and appearance. Hell, I'm a fully functional adult and I have trouble looking presentable. It's a skill, and most consider it a fairly low priority to teach to the mentally handicapped when there are things like independence, personal hygiene, and money management to learn.

3) Some mental illnesses cause loss of control of muscles (such as MS); this leads to limbs appearing misshapen and abnormal facial expressions. 

EDIT: Sorry, as someone wisely pointed out MS is purely a physical handicap, and does not have an impact on the invididual's mental faculties. There are, however, neurologically degenerative diseases that cause problems in both areas.",eli5

The problem with fusion is extracting the energy released through the nuclear process. I believe we have now created a fusion plant which is releasing more energy than is put into the plant to initiate the reaction but this is so marginal that its not cost effective enough for commercial purposes. 

With regards to the first part of your question, the ""20 years away"" statement is usually propaganda to ensure that funding isn't cut by the powers that be (who typically don't understand the scientific method) so that the research can continue. Personally I think that fusion power will be cracked in the next 20 years, especially as the oil will run out and the funding for fusion will have to increase to ensure that we can keep our power hungry lifestyle that we have now.",eli5
2qbclg,Why do pop rocks pop in your mouth? ,"> Here's the basic idea. Hard candy (like a lollypop or a Jolly Rancher) is made from sugar, corn syrup, water and flavoring. You heat the ingredients together and boil the mixture to drive off all of the water. Then you let the temperature rise. What you are left with is a pure sugar syrup at about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). When it cools, you have hard candy.To make Pop Rocks, the hot sugar mixture is allowed to mix with carbon dioxide gas at about 600 pounds per square inch (psi). The carbon dioxide gas forms tiny, 600-psi bubbles in the candy. Once it cools, you release the pressure and the candy shatters, but the pieces still contain the high-pressure bubbles (look at a piece with a magnifying glass to see the bubbles).When you put the candy in your mouth, it melts (just like hard candy) and releases the bubbles with a loud POP! What you are hearing and feeling is the 600-psi carbon dioxide gas being released from each bubble.Source: _URL_0_",eli5

308818,Why aren't planes live-streaming their black-boxes to a cloud? (No pun intended). edit: here's a relevant recent NYTimes article asking the same question: _URL_0_,"The black box for a modern jet stores a lot of information about the state of the aircraft. Fuel levels, engine speeds, position of the rudders, flaps, altitude, air speed, air temp, oil pressure, and many other sensors. 

Even if we pretend we have some kind of global wireless network able to handle that level of data stream from every plane and helicopter in the air, who maintains that global network? who pays for it? who is authorized to access it? who is responsible for gathering data when the plane is on the other side of the planet? who maintains the network in the middle of the ocean? what happens when there's a network outage? do all the planes fly around that section of the sky? I'm sure there are other issues too, but this should give you an idea of the scale of issues such a live stream would create.",eli5

62zfdt,"Why are different types of media released on different days? Books and music are normally released on Tuesdays, comics are released on Wednesdays, and movies usually come out on Fridays. ","Movie theaters make most of their money on weekends, so new releases timing with weekends tends to be the most profitable, what with the ""It's new"" factor, as well as potentially less reviews before the bulk of people get a chance to see it.  (Bad review = less people wanting to see it.  If people get there before they read reviews, studios make more money).

As for the other media, I cannot say.  Am personally irked that video game releases not only happen on school days, but the big releases always feel like they're during finals week or something like that.",eli5

A gigantic island indeed but still a very isolated place where the introduction of some biological material can have catastrophic consequences. For instance, when the English colonists arrived and brought cows as cattle, there was no indigenous insect that could digest their feces, which was actually a very serious problem when the grazelands were nearly unusable. Now imagine if someone inadvertently introduced some insect species that wiped out all the indigenous species, their predators would starve out with catastrophic damage caused to the whole ecosystem.",eli5
