6l9h3c,"Why haven't we built huge trains? I'm just watching a documentary on the Queen Mary, and it said that it contained the power of 24 or something steam trains and was as long as The Eiffel Tower is high, it made me wonder why (especially in North America), they hadn't built absolutely colossal trains?   

If we can build ships, planes, or even buildings many times bigger than the original, why did we not do so with trains?  ","Bigger doesn't always mean better. For trains, specifically, the advancement in technology has been in making the train stronger, not physically larger.

There are three major reasons why making trains bigger is a bad thing.

1) Trains run on tracks, so making a bigger train would require replacing tracks with ones of a different size. While tracks have to be replaced eventually, there is no incentive to force the change by making a larger train.

2) Taller trains, which would be required to increase the size without increasing the width, would be less stable during turns, leading to more derailment and crashes.

3) Trains are already modular, and can be expanded near limitlessly by adding cars onto the back of the train. The only limit is the strength of the locomotive, and even that can be augmented by having extra cars for driving force.

These trains can be collosal in their own rite, with the largest container train in the world being the 4.2 km long double-stack container operated by Canadian National Railway.

The largest test-run train was the BHP Run on June 21, 2001  comprising 682 cars and eight 6000hp locomotives in Australia.",eli5

4983q9,Why does it feel hot when the air temperature is below body temperature?,"For one, your skin is not sitting at 98.6 F, so for air temperature to be lower than the skin, you're actually looking at a lower air temperature.

But another key part is that your body needs to be losing heat to survive, not just maintaining.  Think more like an engine or a computer.

jai8y,Why downloading is so much faster than uploading. ,"The internet connection to your house has a limit to how much data it can transfer, called *bandwidth*.  Bandwidth is measured in megabits per second (Mbps).

So let's say you have a 10 Mbps connection.  You could split it in half, and devote 5 Mbps for uploads and 5 Mbps for downloads.  But most people download a *lot* more than they upload...it would be kind of a waste to be waiting through a big download with that 5 Mbps upload connection unused.  So a lot of providers split the connection unevenly, say, 8 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up.  You are getting 60% more download capacity, at the cost of slower uploads.

1ka4po,"Why is there such vast fluctuations in prescription drug prices? In the last couple months I have noticed my prescription has gone from $10 for a month supply, to $24 and yesterday I went to pickup my RX and it was $93.   ","First we have to ask, how are you paying? There are 3 ways that cover almost all prescription costs:

 * Out of Pocket - You pay what the label says unless you have a friend behind the counter!

 * Drug Manufacturer Rebates - Often doctors and other providers can get rebate cards for brand name medications (often that don't have a generic) that effectively discount the drug or can even make it free! Especially if it is a critical medication.

 * Insurance or 3rd Reimbursement - This a big and complicated one! And it starts with an example story. Originally you could go to the pharmacy and pick up your medication no-charge. Companies quickly found out the people were picking up meds that they didn't *really* need and not using them, essentially wasting the insurances money. Something like, picking up a refill on nausea medication every month even though you only used a few pills from the first bottle. 

So began the practice of Co-pay. The insurance company *tells the pharmacy* a dollar amount the customer is supposed to be charged based on many factors, so many that most any pharmacy will refuse to quote a price because even their best guess is often wrong.  Essentially it is supposed to be a dollar amount to 'encourage' the patient to only get what they need and to get the 'right' medication. 

Some factors *may* include:

* The right pharmacy - some big insurances have special contracts with big players like walgreens. **more pharmacy issues below**

* The insurance plan - Many insurances have a huge numer of plans that all require different levels of reimbursement and co-pay

* The brand of Drug - And not just Brand name vs Generic! Often insurance companies may be owned or have contracts for discounted rates with drug manufacturers. So depending, they might 'prefer' for you to buy all your generics from one over another. 

* Has the doctor given you other treatments - Have an ear infection? Did the doctor try the cheap/basic antibiotic before writing for that high end brand name antibiotic? A copay of 150 dollars vs 10 for the other will help encourage you to the cheaper option for them, while not explicitly forcing you to. 


The final charge of the Pharmacy. This is the last and could be the most signifigant factor. Ask around! Often a pharmacist can advise you. Because this is such a complex process you might find it cheaper to buy some of your medications out of pocket from one generic company rather than paying the copay and using a more expensive generic. Also pharmacies that allow Pharmacists to change price may let you personally negotiate if you are paying out of pocket. (Big places like Walgreens usually don't, but some places like Homeland and smaller independent pharmacies do)

The goofiest part is what insurance pays vs the advertised price. Prices are purposely stated high and then the insurance negotiates them lower. Walgreens might quote 250 dollars for a drug, but the insurance actually pays 20. Unfortunately paying out of pocket they try to charge you the 'sticker price', especially at big chains. Going different places they may offer you a cash-out-of-pocket discount because the price doesn't reflect what it actually costs. This is usually sort of under the table so to speak, so don't hesitate to ask the pharmacist and call around, especially to privately owned pharmacies. Most are glad to help, but don't assume that they can *always* cut your costs in two!",eli5

2aqrtv,"Why does the production of iron through fusion signal the immediate death of a star? If we launched a shipload of iron into the sun, would it start to die? ","**Answer to first question:**
Elements lighter than iron give off more energy when they fuse than it takes to fuse them, so using fusion to produce something like carbon leaves energy left over to keep the reaction going.
Once you fuse iron, heavier elements take more energy to fuse than they give off, so trying to fuse something heavier pulls energy out of the star, and shuts the reaction off. 

**Answer to second question:**
No, it would not die. If we launched something the size of earth at the Sun it would destroy it and just keep on burning without missing a beat. Also, the sun will never produce iron. It is too small. Only massive stars will produce iron.",eli5

29lnih,Why does salt water help heal wounds? ,"**It acts as a mild antibacterial (bacteriostat), allowing your body to focus on repair rather than disinfection.**

Cells, including bacteria, cannot manually control their hydration, they depend on the diffusion of water through their membranes (osmosis). The high salt concentration in the salt water draws out water *out* of the bacteria, leaving them in a shrunken, dehydrated state that makes it hard for them to replicate. In essence, it makes them weaker and easier for your immune system to clear up.

However, many bacteria can produce slimy coverings that limit osmosis. This is why salt water is not a fool proof treatment of open-wounds, but a home treatment that can help for small cuts and scratches that can seal relatively quickly.",eli5

22ke96,"Why the Hepatitis B vaccine is frequently given immediately after birth I don't know if they do this in all countries, but in the United States it is common to give the Hep B vaccine immediately after birth rather than waiting until 2 months like they do with other shots. It's also usually entirely optional and they will put it off until 2 months if you want to wait. 

I was just wondering if there is a solid reason for doing it immediately after birth? I thought it was a mainly an STD and vaccinating at birth would mainly just be for cases where the mother was infected. Does something happen between birth and 2 months that puts newborns at risk for Hep B? ","Hepatitis B is transmitted through bodily fluids like saliva and blood, while in adults, it is mostly transmitted sexually, in young children it can be transmitted through scratching each other, putting things into their mouths (that another baby may have come into contact with), etc. In children, Hep B has a longer dormancy period, so by the time you catch a case, the baby could have infect many other children.

Also Hep B can be transmitted from mother to offspring. In children Hep B is much more severe and can lead to a lifetime of serious liver trouble and vastly increases the person's risk of liver cancer. Immediate immunization of the newborn prevent this mother-offspring transmission.

Therefore the medical establishment decided to be better safe than sorry. Before mass immunization of children and babies in the 80s, 1 out of 10 cases of Hep B was in children under 5, after widespread immunization, the 1 in 1000 cases of Hep B was in children.",eli5

1v79ug,Why are gag orders legal? Wouldn't it violate the constitution or something?,"At first glance, they do look like they would cause some issues with freedom speech.  However, a big part of the legal system is to attempt to provide people with fairness and justice.  When a gag order is issued, a judge forbids people involved with a court case from talking about the case publicly.  This is necessary because the point of a trial is to have an unbiased group of peers decide guilt based on evidence presented during the trial.  Publicizing information can limit the number of people who can come into the courtroom as fully neutral jurors.  Also, gag orders prevent the parties involved from taking advantage of access to the media and arguing their cases in an unregulated way.  

The general idea is that freedom of speech is not absolute and there is a strong interest in maintaining fair trials, so gag orders are necessary.  It's worth noting, though, that gag orders only apply to those involved in the trial.  A news reporter still has freedom of speech/press, making it legal for the reporter to talk about the case.",eli5

2km9fi,"What are the practical effects of animals having differently shaped pupils? Cats have slit pupils, goats have rectangles, we have circles, why is this and what does it do?","Animals with slit eyes tend to be crepuscular or nocturnal (active during the dusk and dawn, or at night) and predators. Animals with round pupils, including us, tend to be diurnal (active during the day) omnivores or herbivores.

A slit pupil is more efficient at opening and closing than a round pupil. Cats and snakes hunt at night, and so need good vision in the dark, but they can also be active during the day, when there is lots of light. Hence a slit pupil can open all the way, exposing almost the whole lens for hunting at night, but can close almost all the way so that the animal doesn't go blind in the bright sun. This is especially important for snakes and most lizards who don't have eyelids that open and close.

With our round pupils we have fairly crap, monochromatic vision at night, and have to squint in the sun.

Goats technically have slit eyes, by the way, but their slit goes sideways. This is for the same reason as cats and snakes, but since goats don't hunt, their sideways slit allows them a wide field of vision, so that they can spot predators sneaking up on them in the dark.",eli5

1cqcww,"Why did Microsoft get in trouble for bundling Internet Explorer with Windows, while modern companies like Google bundle many more things together in their products without getting in trouble? I remember being in high school when the antitrust lawsuits came out. At the time, I remember the supposed issue was MS bundling Internet Explorer with Windows and integrating it into the rest of the operating system, and this was somehow ruled anticompetitive. But, 10 years later, we have companies bundling services together all the time - Google itself has the Google search engine, Gmail, GDrive, Google Plus, etc. Macs come bundled with Safari, Facebook comes bundled with a chat program. Android comes with tons of Google stuff built right in - everything from Google Maps to Gmail to you name it.

So why was MS singled out for bundling a web browser in with an OS when other companies can get away with it? Has the law changed since then, or is there more to the story?","Microsoft didn't get in trouble for bundling the IE browser with Windows, Microsoft got in trouble because they made it nearly impossible to get RID of it, and at one point I believe they were actively sabotaging other browsers when people tried to use them.

Google may bundle a bunch of services together like you mentioned, but nothing about those services interferes with my ability to use other services if I choose.

You're a senior, you play on the football team (you are the starting QB), you have a lot of friends and a pretty girl that you plan on asking to prom.  Things are pretty good.

There's some 9th grade little kid always talking about how he can ""kick everyone's ass"" and that he's ""got a gun at home"" and will ""shoot you if you mess with him"".  He's being a twat to everyone that knows him, and you know he probably beats up on his younger brothers and sisters at home.  

This kid comes up to you and tells you he's going to kick your ass.  You have two options:

- ignore the kid 
- beat the snot out of the kid

The only problem is that this kid's two cousins **also** go to school with you.  They don't really like him, but they kinda have to protect him.  His cousins don't play football with you, but they do play basketball, and they are pretty big dudes.  If you hit this kid, you are probably going to have to deal with the cousins at some point.  If you decide to bring some of your football buddies to back you up, they'll bring some of their basketball buddies, and it might end up being a rumble on the playground after school.

You would love to teach this kid a lesson, get him to stop beating up on his siblings, and shut him up once and for all, but his existance really isn't affecting your life, and doing something probably isn't worth the resulting fallout.  So you just ignore him, knowing it's possible he mights just piss off his cousins enough that *they* do something about it, because this kid fucking sucks.

I recently bought a pack of rechargable AA batteries and promptly returned them when I read they had to be replaced and recharged every couple of hours in like a TV remote. Why do non-rechargable batteries last for months?,"They don't need to be recharged every couple of hours.  They need to be recharged after a couple of hours of **use**.  

In this instance, that would mean pushing a button on your TV remote and holding it down for a couple of hours straight, but you don't do that.  You push a button for a small fraction of a second each time you use it.  That kind of use translates in to months of life regardless of what type of battery you're using.  

Rechargeable batteries don't last as long as standard ones, but the difference is not that dramatic, especially in a low-draw application like a TV remote.",eli5
4p26ne,Why can we not see our eyes move in mirrors?,"We actually don't see a lot of things. 

As our eyes move, our brain blocks out the movement simply because the visual of said movement is not worthwhile to our brains as it is very blurred. To deal with this useless info the brain simply *displays* the last thing it saw before we moved for a slightly longer time, and the first thing it can process after looking

As an example, if you very quickly look at a clock, you might notice the first second you see takes a bit longer than the rest, because the brain replaced blurred and useless visuals that would otherwise be too blurry and wastes brain power/disorients us.

Our brains are so good at replacing this useless visual data that we almost never notice it unless it is pointed out to us. If we didn't do this the would would be extremely blurry and it would be very disorienting to swing your head around, which back in the days of hunting and gathering, would essentially be a death sentence if anything attacked you from behind. So the reason, to put it simply is evolution trying to make rapid head/eye movements as non-disorienting as possible.",eli5

I'm 22 now and am realizing when I talk with other friends how some of my vocabulary and other knowledge has just disappeared over time. ","Edit: Someone else needs to come up with a better ELI5 answer than mine, I know its not perfect. 

Current models for memory (still mostly theoretical but gains are being made all the time) have it that memory is simply the way the neurons are wired together. Forming new memories involves chaining the electrical and chemical connections between your brain, not growing new cells. 

And you brain has trillions of neurons, that's a lot, to play with in creating memory. Some think specific memories may be stored at the level of two or even one single neuron connection. This may be why memory is stored in clusters. You have the memories for polar bear, north pole, and pole dancing pretty close to each other (its how we learn). If you don't constantly use the memory the connections will get old and weak, not be as easily recalled. Eventuallty your brain will write over old unused memories with newer, more important ones.

What happens in your body during the period after your workout? ,"Specifically in a way that doesnt go to much in depth, is activating many..many..many.. different hormonal systems in place to prepare your body to condition the physical exertion you used.

A large part of this is the mitochondrial build up in muscle cells - your body is making a shitload more mitochondrion within your muscles to perform more metabolism, even in rest state (and on rest state it tries to kill some to match the metabolic need)

However theres millions of other things going on, and pinpointing them is faulty to conceptually understand the grander scheme.

Your body prepares itself to use more energy to be able to do what you did before. It conditions you, and in turn you are catabolising more actual energy even in rest state.

 >  How has the state's political climate has allowed this to continue?

What politician in specific is bearing the blame and won't get votes because of it? Politicians can talk about how terrible it is and score points, they don't need to solve it themselves. That would require money which is unpopular.

 >  Why can't they just turn on the old filtration system that they had before switching to the new one?

The water purification is fine now. The problem is they had lead pipes with an oxide layer on the inside. When more acidic water was fed into the system it dissolved this layer and allowed more lead into the water, and fixing the water input (as they did) doesn't restore the oxide layer. They need to replace all the lead pipes which is a huge job.

 >  Is any work currently underway to resolve the problem?

Yes, they are digging away. They have been for a long time and will be for an even longer time.

(The actual phrase ""the butler did it,"" however, never appears in the text.)

While suspicion had fallen on butlers with some regularity in earlier mystery fiction, only one previous author placed the knife (or in this case the pistol) directly in the butler's hand: ""The Strange Case of Mr Challoner"" by Herbert Jenkins, published as part of the collection Malcolm Sage: Detective in 1921.

alt2cf,"When a video file (like an .mp4) becomes corrupt, why do the video frames usually all become a solid green color, yet the audio remains intact? Specifically, I saved an .mp4 video from the internet and sent it to my brother on Messenger. A few hours went by and he didn't reply so I checked the video and it's 34 seconds of solid green with the audio perfectly intact. This isn't the first time I've seen this exact behavior with video files so I'm wondering - what gives? ","MP4 files (and similar ones like MKV) are container files which contain 1 or more ""streams"", essentially seperate files that are interwoven together into one file with a header to identify them. A typical mp4 has 1 video stream and 1 audio stream, however it could also have additional audio streams (such as different languages), subtitle streams or per the standard even a second video stream (though finding a player that supports the last one could be difficult).

The standard does not require that these streams be interwoven on a frame by frame basis. It's typically better to have a chunk of audio data that might decode into several seconds worth of sound and then follow it with the video data for 10 seconds worth of frames. So even if some of that video data has been cut off there can be a buffer of audio data still available for playback.

236iz4,"If solar power is economically feasible, why don't more businesses use it to power their stores? (along with stored electricity for cloudy days, of course)","Solar Power is not that economically feasible. It's useful as a supplement to existing power sources.

* Solar power efficiency depends a *lot* on weather, location, and the amount of sunlight an area gets. Businesses with limited space for solar panels, who are in areas that are predominately cloudy, or do not get a lot of sunlight are not going to benefit
* Solar power efficiency depends a *lot* on the technology used. They are constantly developing new methods for solar capture to increase the efficiency of energy capture, but that is mitigated by
* Battery and transmission efficiency, which also needs work. Energy transmission and storage are additional areas of loss. What works for a home probably wouldn't have enough output to run a business during 'bad' days

Taking tax credits into account, its not a bad idea for businesses to *consider* solar as an option to *supplement* existing power. They can also look to get power from a solar or wind provider if their state allows them to pick a distributor. But right now (AFAIK) the technology is not in a state where someone can use a personal solar grid to take more than a small percentage of their power needs. It's a big investment for a small return *in a residence*. A business has even less to gain from it at this time in terms of its price-to-value.

Also, for those businesses who have critical machinery or infrastructure that cannot see downtime, Solar is kind of not a good foundation for their power needs. They will continue to use power derived from traditional sources as its easier to guarantee 24/7 uptime of power.",eli5

But a lot of these explanations are complicated and a little over my head. Does anyone know about this/how to explain it?","Newton said gravity is a mysterious force that affects everything with mass. He didn't know what causes this force but he did create some useful equations.

Then Einstein came up with General Relativity. He says that mass bends space-time and that's why things are attracted to each other. For Example, if you put 2 heavy balls on a trampoline, they warp the trampoline and move towards each other. This is just an analogy, but it helps give you the idea.

This warping of space-time has some other side affects, which allows General Relativity to predict and explain thing that Newton's law doesn't (like small changes in the orbit of planets, light bending around stars, and clocks in GPS satellites running slower).",eli5

Just as it is easier to sleep when it is quiet, it is easier to sleep when it is dark. Stimuli keep your brain alert, and reducing or eliminating stimuli helps your brain relax. 

Some people can sleep with more stimuli around them. Some people want complete silence and complete darkness, while others can sleep sitting up on a crowded train.

It happens when the rotational rate of the spinning object exceeds what our brains can pick up (our internal refresh rate).

So it looks like it's going backwards.

Imagine if an airplane's propeller blade were a clock. When the propeller spins clockwise at a rate that induces the wagon-wheel effect, what you are seeing are frames of the propeller blade when it is at the 12'o clock position at cycle #1000, 10 'o clock position at cycle #1050, and 8 'o clock position at cycle #1100",eli5

As such, the president is elected *by the states.* Not by the people; the people are represented by their members of Congress in the federal legislature, and by their state representatives and their governor in their state capitals. The president works for, and is thus elected, by *the states.*

The fact that at present all the states have chosen to choose and charge their electors by a ballot of their voters is pure coincidence. It isn't required by law. The Constitution — which defines all the rules about how the federal government operates — says *nothing* on the subject of the appointment or instruction of electors. It simply decrees that the states shall pick them and have them cast ballots.

If Nebraska announced tomorrow that starting in 2016 all their electors would be chosen by a statewide arm-wrestling tournament, nobody could say word one about it … except, of course, the people of the great state of Nebraska, because how they choose their electors is *entirely* their business.",eli5
1yzp9p,"How come ""Black Power"" is seen as r Inspiring, and pro-equality/freedom etc. however ""White Power"" is seen as racist? We were studying African American Civil-Rights in history, this thought poped into my head.","Black people have been oppressed, and have been told to be ashamed of who they are, and that they were inferior, equivalent to animals or property.  Supporting Black pride or black power is about saying that there is no need to be ashamed or feel like you are inferior even though society would lead you to believe you are.

White people (as a general vague group) haven't been broadly oppressed in the same way, they have not been near universally considered inferior subspecies who are better used as property then treated as human beings.  On the other hand they've been the groups that have supported and put in place these ideas towards others.

So ""White Power"" is treated as ""supporting oppressing non-whites"" because people who said ""white power"" in the past **actually did that a lot**.  Saying ""Black Power"" is treated as ""overcoming oppression"" because that oppression actually existed/exists.  If Black people had broadly treated any non-blacks as subhumans and used the law to make them property, then ""Black Power"" would be seen as supporting that.",eli5

There's an argument - I don't find it compelling, but it exists - that it's a good idea to block symbols that aren't on the majority of keyboards, so that people can sign in with relative ease from any computer.

Some characters might interfere with the correct functioning of the underlying software, though the ""more correct"" solution is to sanitise inputs rather than restricting their contents.

Characters beyond the ASCII set might be blocked because processing Unicode has a small-but-nonzero computational cost.  Combining characters versus precombined forms are a particularly snarly case of this when it comes to passwords, though if the system is built well there'll be (warning: jargon incoming) a canonicalisation step before hashing.",eli5

5qz2v3,Why are people uninstalling Uber after the protests?,"First of all, the reason they're doing it right now is, as protests got underway at JFK airport the other day against Trump's executive order barring people from 7 predominantly Muslim countries from entry to the US, the New York taxi companies went on a one hour work stoppage, during which time they refused to go to JFK in order to contribute to the protests. That's huge, since taxis are a major way to get to JFK airport--most people don't own cars in New York (you can still get there by train and bus and subway). Seemingly in response to this, Uber turned off ""surge pricing"" for people going to JFK. In other words, Uber saw a big uptick in demand to go to JFK that evening because people couldn't go by taxi. When Uber experiences a surge in business, they raise their rates substantially. But they didn't raise them, they kept them the same for that evening, and therefore muted the effects of the taxi protests. In addition. Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, is perceived as being somewhat close to Trump--Trump appointed him to a business council, the Strategic and Policy Forum. Most leaders in Silicon Valley have kept their distance from Trump. So taken together, Kalanick is seen as a supporter of Trump in some of Trump's hated policies. A memorable tweet against Uber was ""I don't need a ride to Vichy."" Vichy was the seat of the French government that was a puppet of the Nazis during WWII, so invoking Vichy implies that Kalanick is a collaborator in racist Trump policies.

In response, Kalanick has done some backpedaling and says he'll talk to Trump about the ban.",eli5

59bqgb,"How do wind turbines removing energy from the atmosphere not affect weather? So despite the ignorance surrounding wind turbines and a bunch of the ridiculous theories surrounding them, i thought this might be a legit question. 

Harnessing wind with the turbines must slow the wind down if it is transferring the wind's kinetic energy. The moving air particles encounter the obstacle (turbine) and are slowed down. In the long term, couldn't this affect weather patterns by changing the amount of energy in the atmosphere? Or is the amount we're taking out negligible?  

","Completely negligible. You can't build turbine after turbine because at some point they actually slow the wind enough to make the following ones inefficient.

However if you take it globally, just to give you some perspective: Basically all energy that keeps stuff moving on the planet (winds, ocean currents, warming of stuff, evaporation, rain, humans, everything) comes from sunlight. In just a few hours earth receives more energy from the sun than the entire human race uses in a year. And even the energy we use doesn't just disappear. It's transformed. Sometimes directly into heat (energy goes into tree, tree makes wood, we burn wood), sometimes it takes a chain of events (wind turbine makes electricity which goes around a bunch, arrives at your computer, goes into the CPU, you browse reddit). But at the end of the day, (almost) all energy we use goes away as ""waste heat"".

edit: and that waste heat goes into our atmosphere and does stuff. The waste heat from your computer warms up the air, warm air goes up, it makes wind which powers the turbines. A little.",eli5

9ythem,Why does some metal sometimes taste sour/sweet ? ,"The answer is, it shouldn't really.

You have several types of taste receptors. The ""sweet"" receptors are on the lookout for sugars, which are organic molecules (read: mostly carbon based and so not made from metallic elements). On the other hand, your ""sour"" receptors sense changes in H^+ concentration (though strangely, they sense the concentration INSIDE the receptor, so the acid molecule must first get in the cell).

As you can imagine, metallic ions aren't going to activate either of those. If anything, metallic salts (apart from table salt, NaCl) tend to taste quite bitter (though I wouldn't recommend you try - they also tend to be quite poisonous).

This leads to the conclusion that what you're tasting is not metal, and so whatever you're licking is probably not totally clean.

2gfwak,"Why are local IP addresses 192.168.x.x instead of 0.0.x.x or 255.255.x.x etc? I've always wondered and know it's a standard, but why a seemingly arbitrary address instead of something more expected?

EDIT: I understand how it works with the numbers established. My question is why those numbers were chosen in the first place, which seems random.","Even though they look like random decimal numbers they're actually pretty nice looking numbers in binary:

192 = 1100 0000
168 = 1010 1000

127.0.0.1 is also a special kind of IP address, which points to the local host. 127 is also a nice looking binary number:

127 = 0111 1111

On older networks (before the standard was actually established), the number of ones at the start of the address (before the first zero) determined what kind of network it was. The standard was designed to maintain some compatibility with this system. Form this point of view 192 *is* all zeroes (for a network starting with two 1s).

The specifics of why exactly 162 was chosen for private networks (as opposed to any other pretty binary number) isn't really known. Somebody picked it and that's what it's been.

In a practical sense, almost any number can be used and could've been chosen. To somebody, at one point or another, that seemed like the most sensible option.",eli5

556our,When purchasing a new car why does the dealership ask for a down payment? Does that downpayment go towards the payment of the car?,"A. If you have cash on hand the banks think you have your shit together and are more likely to give you a loan. If they have to repossess the vehicle it will be more likely worth more than the original amount you borrowed and they lose less money. 

B. Banks will typically set a limit to the amount of money they are willing to give for a certain make and model if you have shitty credit. Usually a max of around 120% NADA retail value.  If you are looking at a car that the dealership is wanting $15,000 but the NADA value is only $10,000. If they get you to put down $3000 they can get you to borrow the full remaining $12,000 the bank is willing instead of having to back down on their price.

C. Dealerships like to focus your attention on monthly affordability rather than total end cost. Typically every $1000 you put down will drop your monthly payment by about $20. You may be able to afford $350 a month but 7 years is a long time.  

D. The more money you put down the less you pay in interest over the life of the loan. Good for you. 


Used to be a car salesman. 

Edit: Sorry misread the second part. 

Any money you put down will lower the total amount you have to borrow. The down payment doesn't go towards your payments it goes towards the original total price of the car plus taxes and fees. It was never part of the bank loan. The bank likes to see that you put money down but it doesn't have anything to do with them other than they might lose less money if they have take it back",eli5

**1: Motion Blur**

A video camera is capturing 24 still photos of movement per second. Depending on various camera settings this will almost never capture perfectly frozen 'still' images. Instead it captures a bit of blurred movement. Pause a DVD during a car chase to easily see the effect. Strung together with the other blurry frames it produces video that looks very smooth and still appears sharp. This is mostly because the brain works with the video to lie to us about its sharpness because it is not dissimilar to how the eye works in the first place. 

A video game is doing to opposite. It is rendering 24 perfectly still frames (or usually more) per second. Zero blur, just absolutely none. Much like a flip book the action (if not flipped fast enough) looks jerky. Combined with a lack of the second kind of blur, it makes for a far less smooth look. 

**2: Resolution Blur**

People tend to forget this one. The actual resolution of Real Life ^(tm) is virtually infinite. The individual pixels (or atoms I guess) can't even be seen by the human eye and a video camera perceives far less than that. This creates a bit of edge blur. Even the finest printed text has a soft edge versus text on a screen. A camera is capturing images of that real life and retains that blur, which is what we are used to seeing. 

Pixels on the other hand have a hard edge. And aside from screens with a high PPI (pixels per inch or what Apple calls a Retina display) they aren't that hard to see. So your video game not only has a render of a still moment (alien to our eyes) but it has hard edges that don't blend (also alien to our eyes). Since neither of those things are what an eye is used to seeing the whole experience just looks ""off"" and jumpy. 

That's why Anti-Aliasing has become more and more popular in video games as it helps to eliminate those hard edges. That combined with higher frame rates (getting close to the number of individual frames our eyes can perceive recreates that motion blur) considerably smoothes out the experience.

**TL;DR:** ***Blur***, but more than one kind.",eli5

5gu74d,Why do we only sometimes use 'www.' in front of web addresses? Isn't it redundant at this point?,"Lets first look at a url.  Let's take this one:
https://_URL_3_/r/explainlikeimfive/

This is actually comprised of several parts.  The first part is the ""https://"".  That denotes that we are using the HTTPS protocol.  The second part is ""_URL_3_"".  That denotes the server.  The final part is ""/r/explainlikeimfive/"".  That is the directory on the server we are going to.

Since your question was about the second part, let's take a look at how names on the internet work.  The only way computers can communicate online is with IP addresses, which look something like this: ""151.101.65.140"".  (That's actually Reddit's IP address, BTW)  Since it would be a pain in the butt to remember that and type it in all the time, we have what is called DNS.  Think of it like a phone book; when your computer wants to know where to find ""_URL_3_"" it looks it up in a phone book (DNS server) and gets the address.  Your computer can now communicate with the Reddit servers and get the page it wants.

But what about the ""www"" part?  Well, since a single server will frequently serve multiple web pages, there needs to be a way to distinguish them all.  In the early days of the internet, servers couldn't handle much, so a single server would only usually server a single companies site.  (Today they can handle hundreds of sites all at once.)  When your web browser goes to ""_URL_3_"" it will tell the server it's looking for ""_URL_3_"", so the server can serve you Reddit goodness instead of ""_URL_0_"".  The www portion is often used to distinguish between several different services a single company might offer.  For example, ""_URL_2_"" will redirect to gmail, and ""_URL_6_"" sends you to google drive.  ""www"" is the de-facto service for a companies front-page.  _URL_3_ will take you to the Reddit homepage and _URL_4_ will take you to the Google homepage.  This has long been the case, but recently we see companies who only offer one service, such as twitter, dropping that standard and assuming that someone accessing ""_URL_1_"" wants the twitter homepage.  Conversely we see companies like Reddit sticking with the de-facto standard and prepending ""www"" onto requests for ""_URL_5_""

Ejaculation is a more complex process that includes using the muscles of the pelvic floor to drive the semen out. Basically, the semen is stored in tubes that connect to the urinary duct, and then these muscles propel it out (see a textbook for details).

Interestingly, you can also use these same muscles to propel out remaining urine in the urinary duct.

998hnh,How exactly does chemotherapy work and why does it seem to be the most common treatment for cancer? ,"Cancer is basically glitched cells that lose control of the regulation of replication and end up mass producing more and more cancerous cells in quick succession. This occurs from DNA damage often spurred on by damage to genes involving DNA repair. These cells now behave differently to 'normal' cells so can be targeted and killed by drugs (chemotherapy). However, the behaviour targeted is the rapid replication and some normal cells (hair, stomach lining ect.) do this normally and can end up being targeted along with the cancerous cells as a side effect. This is due to the fact that chemotherapy is delivered and spread by your circulatory system so it can get all around your body (good because you want it to target all the cancer/bad because you then cant stop it from targeting everything else). 

The reason cancer is so shit is because, unlike diseases caused by viruses and bacteria which can be identified and exclusively targeted by drugs, cancer is all you. Hence chemotherapy is very 'indiscriminate'. 

Things like radiotherapy again cant exclusively target cancer cells but can target an area of tissue and kill everything in the area (including healthy cells) but at least the damage is contained in that area. Radiotherapy is a common treatment but is only good if we are confident that the cancer is all still contained in the target area. Remember cancer cells are broken cells and can dislodge from where they came from and potentially get into the blood and spread around the body where they will continue to proliferate (replicate) maybe causing a tummor to form somewhere else. In this situation chemotherapy would be the more effective treatment. 

The bottom line is that although some cell types are more prone to becoming cancerous it could happen to any cell and situation and diagnoses will dictate what treatment is used. Chemotherapy is the just currently the most tested, kind of well understood, and most broad weapon against cancer thus is most commonly used. Oncology, the study of cancer, has loads of new potential experimental ways of fighting cancer in a more friendly manner but all of which need testing to hell and back before they can be concidered for mainstream hospitals.

Tldr: chemotherapy is spread throughout the body and targets rapidly proliferating (replicating) cells. Essentially most effective but also very harmful.",eli5

5qe2gm,What Caused the Great Depression?,"Many factors, but in a nutshell: The stock market crash of 1929 decimated some banks that were offering margin (money loaned to buy stocks) to traders who lost everything and could not pay back their margin loans.  Because some of these banks had over leveraged their depositor's money, the bank went out of business and the depositors lost all or most of their money.  This triggered a nation wide run on the banks, including banks that were not affected by the crash.  People were worried that their money was not safe at any bank, so in a small time frame, most depositors closed their accounts and took all their cash out.  The problem is that banks loan out the money that is deposited in their bank, so they generally only have about 20% of the actual cash that is in people's accounts.  In order to keep their liquidity, banks started calling in loans (meaning they had to be paid in full).  Most people could not pay off their loans all at once, so they were foreclosed on (their collateral was seized).  So people started losing their homes, businesses, and farms.  This led to a lack of jobs and an economic depression.",eli5

5co1pz,"Why do tasks get easier, the longer the tool? Probably quite a simple one, but I can barely think of how to phrase the Google search. 
A wrench with a longer handle has an easier time with a bolt, a hammer with a longer handle hits harder, a crowbar prises objects easier the longer it is. Why is this?","It's actually not a trivial question, even though most people might instinctively think it should be easy.

The word that's probably at the tip of your tongue but not coming out is ""leverage"". The actual law of physics is descriptively called ""the law of the lever"", part of the field of mechanics and you can look it up to get all the formulae if you're interested.

But you can imagine it this way:

Everything you want to move and do costs a certain amount of energy. The bigger and heavier something is, the more energy it costs to move. Also, the further you want to move it, the more energy it costs in total.
Something that is big, but only needs to be moved a small distance might cost the same energy as something that's small, but needs to be moved a long distance. A big force over a small distance, or a small force over a long distance. Same energy needs. 

The amount of *force* required is what makes things seem more comfortable and easy for us. 

As humans we're very good at moving things up to a certain size. You can carry a cup of coffee around all day if you wanted, but if you carry a big carton of milk it'll feel heavy quickly. We're good at coping with smaller loads, because the muscles in our bodies are trained at carrying the weight of ourselves around, and something small like a cup of coffee doesn't make a big difference, where a heavy thing would. 


Now, when you use a long tool, a big lever, the energy you have to use to do the work is the same as with a short one, but it seems easier because you spread all that energy over a much longer path! The crowbard actually pries only maybe half an inch / a centimeter of the door, whereas at the handle where your hands rest you're moving 10, 15 inches / 25-40 cm through the air. Since the energy you put in using your hands and the energy that the crowbar exerts on the door is the same, but the path travelled is so much smaller at the door, the force on the door is many times that which you use on the handle.

So because the energy stays the same, but the path traveled is much longer, the amount of force we have use is smaller and it becomes easier for us to do!

Hope this makes it a little clearer!",eli5

3muk4y,"Precise technologies are made precise because the machines used to make them are precise. How was the ""first"" precise machine built? How did we know that the first ""perfectly straight line"", for example, was so, if there wasn't an existing ""perfectly straight tool"" to make it or evaluate it? The question in the title may be a bit oversimplified but I wanted to be clear. I do understand that our precision has vastly improved over the centuries. For example, I know that we used to use a physical ""meter stick"" to calibrate distance measurements, and that today we use the distance light travels in a given amount of time. Atomic clocks are, obviously, more precise than mechanical clocks. The question is applicable to any step in that process of improvement - how do you make a new, more precise instrument from less precise ones? Thanks!

*Edit - Thanks for the replies! We've been focusing on how you go from low precision (e.g. hand-drawn straight line) to some precision (e.g. using a taught string) ... we're still a long way off from the very high precision of modern instruments (e.g. lasers) ... does anyone know a resource that might carry this process from ancient times all the way to today? (about ""straight lines"" or another aspect of precision)",It's easy to make a pretty good straight line. Hammer two nails halfway into a piece of wood and then stretch a string between them. It'll make a nice straight line. You could then use that as a guide to carefully carve a straight line into something else.,eli5

zjkgl,"Why is Jimmy Carter considered such a bad president? He seems like the nicest man who's ever become President, but remembered as a bad one.","As someone who is old enough to remember Carter's presidency, I can give you a couple things that people held against him. First, he took over the office from a guy who never really wanted to be President. Ford ran for re-election, but was a placeholder for the rest of Nixon's tenure. Kind of hard to be great when the bar is set so low. 

Carter also had issues with his brother who, by the media, was portrayed as the stereotypical redneck. Carter also had the disadvantage of having the first fully televised Presidency. Nixon got the TV cameras to follow the Commander in Chief to follow the President when they thought he was doing something wrong. Ford was followed, but only so Chevy Chase could make fun of him on Saturday nights. Carter had the camera thrust on him and he did not play well. 

Reagan, who grew up in the camera's eye, was used to the exposure and that helped Reagan make Carter look like a hick. Carter could bring peace to warring nations, but was also remembered for saying he got attacked by a swimming rabbit. 

Carter couldn't get the Iranian hostages freed and got fooled by Castro in the Murial boatlift. Reagan promised to restore the Country to the days of Eisenhower. 

In short, Carter was overshadowed by a guy who was just filling in and a guy who knew what to say when the cameras were on. It wasn't that Jimmy Carter was a bad President, he just looked bad compared to what followed.",eli5

Intoxication can make you uninhibited (either as a direct affect of the alcohol, or a psychological affect where you tell yourself it's okay to let loose because you've been drinking and can blame ""blame it on the juice""), and you relax a bit and rely more on instinct. Skills which are hindered by stress or being self conscious would thus stand to be improved a bit with intoxication.

* 'Profanity' - ""Jesus Christ!""

These are the words / phrases that people get offended by purely for religious reasons.  Closely related to 'blasphemy', which is essentially insulting religious things on purpose.

* 'Cursing' - ""Go to Hell!""  ""Damn you!"" - basically just wishing that something bad will happen to someone.  People don't like that for obvious reasons.

* 'Vulgarity' - 'Shit!'  'Fuck!' - basically, George Carlin's 7 words.  These are the most interesting, because *there's really no good reason why these words bother anyone*.

1h407f,"If all Americans are required to have a Social Security card/number, why doesn't the SSA issue free voter IDs to everyone? It just seems to be a logical solution to voter ID laws. They already have the list.

Edit: Maybe I should have posted this in /r/CrazyIdeas ","(There may be *some* bias involved below.)

A Social Security number is *not* an ID number for anything other than Social Security. That it has become used for general identification is a testament to the dysfunction of our government. A proper identification system should include other features and a different set of rigor in determining who someone is; the Social Security administration should not be shouldering the responsibility of national identification.

That being said, I simply don't understand why there is not an established national identification method already. When you start a club before you talk about dues, by-laws, regular meetings, clubhouses, etc... the first thing you figure out is who is in the club! A republic based upon the votes of representatives should darn well know who they are representing, and a country should have a good idea who its citizens are! It baffles me why this hasn't already happened.

The reason it hasn't happened is that a bunch of people get up in arms in protest when the barest hint of the idea surfaces. As far as I can tell this has two basic roots: First, it is commonly expected that if the government knows something about you it will, eventually, find some way to use that knowledge to fuck with you. Much like pleading the 5th many people prefer to keep anything they possibly can out of the hands of the government for fear that it will be used against them. I can't say that these people are entirely in the wrong.

The second reason is religion. Many Christians will point to the drug-addled fever dream of the book of Revelations 13:17 where it talks about a ""dragon"" putting a mark on everyone: ""And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.""

Conceptually presenting ID would be required to make credit purchases to combat fraud, and we aren't really *that* far away from many stores going to a credit-only sales model. One of the things preventing this is the adherence of large swaths of our population to some of the least coherent myths of an early Iron Age civilization.

With that in mind it is easier for me to understand why national ID cards haven't taken off as an idea, but slightly harder to understand why our civilization hasn't choked to death on its own saliva.",eli5

22rko4,"Why is ""bloody"" a swear word to the English, and how severe is it really (preferably using an American English counterpart swear to explain)? I've always been curious. Why's it a big deal, and what American swear word is it analogous to?","No-one's touched on *why* yet, and I find this kind of thing quite interesting.

Swearing is typically related to one of three things: sex (fuck off!), bodily functions (piss off!) and religious imagery (oh God!).

The explanation I'd seen is that ""bloody"" refers to the blood of Christ, as in ""I swear by the blood of Christ you will regret that, young William!"" Shakespeare's characters often use this religious type of swear word: the oft-parodies ""zounds"" is a contraction from ""God's wounds"" which refers to the wounds Christ suffered on the cross. (Incidentally, in Ireland I'm told that ""suffering Jesus"" is used as an expletive by some people.)

However, this explanation is disputed and there are other explanations. Some people say it originated in the description for Queen Mary of England, who was known as ""Bloody Mary"" for the sheer number of executions she ordered in her reign.

Another suggestion is that it comes from the Dutch ""bloote"" which means ""purely, entirely, very, truly"" as in ""bloody good shot, old boy"". This would fit well with the emphasiser usage.

One interesting note is how different countries react to different swear words: many light swear words in the USA are minced versions of religious swearing, as the USA is far more sensitive about such things than the UK. Someone saying ""Jesus!"" in the UK is not really swearing much, but in the USA it got shortened to ""Gee!"" to avoid swearing. Similarly ""Crikey"" for ""Christ"", ""Gosh"" for ""God"" and ""darn"" and ""dang"" for ""damn"". (In the UK we use ""damn"" quite freely: it is not considered offensive, as in ""those damn beavers keep damming by moat!"")

So I ran a little off topic there, but hopefully you found that bloody interesting and damn enlightening.",eli5

Heavy thing must fall down. ","All the answers so far are wrong -- or at least, they're using a different idea of what a ""cloud"" is than the OP.  If by ""cloud"" you mean ""a bunch of tiny water droplets suspended in the air"", well then water is definitely heavier than air, so the droplets should fall.

And they *are* falling through the air around them.  Imagine spritzing a spray bottle of water to make small droplets. Or just sneeze.  The droplets fall, but because of air resistance the small ones fall very slowly.  The water droplets in a cloud are *very* small, they only fall a [fraction of an inch](_URL_0_) per second.

Now imagine boiling a pot of water on the stove.  The cloud of steam you see is also made of little droplets of water.  Why don't they fall?  Because they're caught in a current of hot rising moist air: they fall more slowly than the air rises, so it carries them with it.

Clouds are exactly the same.  What you're seeing is a bunch of very small water droplets slowly falling through a tower of warm rising air that keeps them up.  That air is rising because it's warm -- even with the heavy water droplets inside it, it's less dense than its surroundings.  So if by ""cloud"" you mean ""a tower of warm air with some water drops in it"", then it's no surprise at all that a cloud should float.",eli5

3ndqpl,"Why is low body fat attractive and high body fat unattractive? Of course beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but let's get real - most people are attracted to low body fat","Beauty standards are a combination of biological and cultural factors. Biologically it seems like body proportions matter more than the fat content, so the ratio between waist and hip for women and waist and shoulders for men. Now naturally body fat content affects these proportions and obese people don't have the ideal proportions, but likewise extremely thin people don't have the ideal proportions. Generally modest amount of fat is biologically good, as it indicates that the person isn't starving but is healthy, so the person is a suitable mate.

But these biological proportions also give some space for cultural variations on beauty standards when it comes to body fat content, as cultural cues are also important when humans seek a mate. A few hundred years ago being [a bit plump like this](_URL_2_) indicated prosperity. But it's worth noting that even those bodies aren't obese. 

However during our time fast food and unhealthy food is seen food for the poor and uneducated, and having less body fat is seen as a signal that the person is more affluent and can afford to eat well and exercise and has better self control, so having a slender body [like this](_URL_0_) is a social cue for a certain social status and properties currently valued (self control, health consciousness, ambition, willpower).

There is another example of beauty standard which has changed over time. A few hundred year for the upper class it was desirable to be [pale like this](_URL_1_), as pale color indicated the person does not need to spend outside, i.e. isn't a tanned filthy peasant working in the sun on the fields. So people, both women and men used make up to make themselves more pale.

Then the industrial revolution came, urbanization increased and more and more people started working inside factories and eventually doing office jobs. As the ""working class"" now worked mainly inside, in urban context being untanned became undesirable and having a tan was a sign that the person could afford to go to holidays and spend time outside to the extent that they get a nice tan. So historically being tanned/untanned has varied greatly.",eli5

21puyx,"How Did People Keep Record of Date Before We Knew That 1 Year = 365 Days? For example The Battle of Hastings was in the year 1066, but how did people know that a year was 365 days/when the Earth orbits the Sun?","The earliest calendars were lunar ones. This is the origin of the word month - the ""mo"" bit comes from moon. A lunar month was just over 29 and a half days. Each lunar month began as soon as you could first see the new moon in the west at sunset.

The years can be fairly easily measured. Times like when the sun is directly overhead at noon at a certain place, or when the noonday shadow becomes shortest or longest, or when the length of the day was equal to the length of the night, weren't hard to determine. So the cycle of lunar months was kept in line with the movements of the sun by adding a 13th month whenever needed, as determined by measuring the sun.

Edit: By the time of hastings, the length of the year had been determined very accurately. It was a time when the western world was in the process of moving from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian Calendar. The Julian, which used a day length of 365.25 days - leap days every 4 years - was introduced by Julius Caesar in the year 46 BC (by our calculations). It replaced the earlier Roman calendar of 365 days that was introduced in 713 BC. This Roman calendar used a short additional end to February irregularly, to keep it in sync. 

The Gregorian Calendar is the one we use today. The only difference was a once-off dropping of 11 days so the months and the years would line up once more, and not having leap years 3 years out of every 400 years (Years divisible by 100 are not leap years, unless they also are divisible by 400, so 1900 was not a leap year, 2000 was, and 2100 will not be).

TL;DR: we have known that they year is 365.25-and-a-bit days long for a very long time.",eli5

What does insurance do if you're still doing payments on your car and someone totals it?

Does insurance pay the rest of your balance for the car, and reimburse you for what you already paid?","If the car is deemed a write off (cost to repair is more than the market value of the car), the insurance will pay you said market value.

This has no impact on your obligation to the whoever you bought the car from. So if you owe your dealership 20 grand, but the insurance only paid you 15 grand because that is the value of the car, then you're gonna have to cough up an extra 5 grand!

Also, it may depend on any special insurance packages you may get. For instance, there's one that if your car is totaled within the first 2 or 3 years of ownership, then they will actually get you a brand new car. But you would have had to agreed to it and paid a slight premium on top.",eli5

Obviously that doesn't work very well. This means that if someone becomes nervous during the test, it will be assumed they're lying. The problem is, people don't just get nervous when they're lying, they get nervous for a whole bunch of reasons. For example, if they're being interrogated.

On the other hand, people can lie and not get stressed out. And as it just so happens, these people tend to be those that lie a lot",eli5

3ouibk,How come we can not prove or deny existence of an afterlife? ,"As the old saying goes - ""The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence"". The afterlife is usually described as something non-material (i.e. spiritual). Because of this - it specifically rules out any possibility that it can ever be independently verified through material means (i.e. science). So we can't disprove an afterlife, but only can point to the lack of evidence supporting it.  
For those who believe it - they point to experiential evidence. As in the testimony of those who have experienced the afterlife in near death experiences. They may also point to their own experiences.  More commonly - they may point to their own personal religious affiliation and the teachings that religion asserts about the afterlife.  
For those opposed to it - they point to the lack of any objective evidence that can be independently verified. They also note that believing something simply because it can't be dis-proven could also be used to support the most ridiculous assertions (such as a ""Flying Spaghetti Monster"").

2q6pui,"Why my phone battery doesn't drain at a constant rate It was going to be hard to fit all the nuances of my question into the title so here's is a more detailed explanation of my question:

Last night driving home, I was using my phone for GPS (screen on, everything up and running). During the trip my phone gave me a low battery notification at 14%. 10 minutes later it gave me a critical low battery notification at 4%. At that rate I would expect the battery to be completely drained in about 5 more minutes. However, my phone stayed up and running for another 55  minutes even with the screen still on and GPS active.

What is going on with that? Is it the software that's incorrect? Is something else going on?

3cu0ai,Why Are Reddit URL's Caps Sensitive When Most Other Websites Aren't? ,"It's fairly common for non-human-readable segments of a URL to be case sensitive since that allows you to fit more data into fewer characters.  You aren't trying to make it easy for someone to type ""3cu0ai"", so you may as well use something short and hard to type instead of something long and almost as hard to type.

Note that if Reddit (or YouTube, or Google, or any number of other companies) decides to use a 6 character code and they limit themselves to a-z (lowercase) and 0-9 then they have about 2 billion possible addresses they can use ((26+10)^(6)).  This may seem like a lot, but it's small enough that huge sites need to consider it.  They don't want people randomly stumbling on existing pages because of a mistyped URL.  If they extend to the ability to use A-Z as well then they have 56.8 billion possible addresses.  This is better for something like Reddit, but YouTube takes it a step further and uses 11 characters for 52 quintillion possibilities.  At that level it is highly unlikely that anyone will randomly stumble across a video just by typing in random gibberish.  This can be double useful for a site like YouTube that allows people to share unlisted postings by passing around an obscure URL.",eli5

Reddit, I was wondering if you knew why doctors weren't getting sick when they work with so many different patients and are in contact of so many different illnesses every day.

Similarly, in hospitals, most doctors are treating transplant patients, broken bones, heart attacks, cancer patients, and the likes. 

While there are many illnesses a person can suffer from, very few can actually be spread by general face to face contact.

25k4m4,"Why does dark chocolate completely change in taste and texture once it has melted on a hot day and re-solidified? I play in a band full of dark-chocolate-lovers, and this always happens when we tour in hotter climates: Our stash of dark chocolate melts in the sun, and then re-solidifies into a much lighter coloured, and chalkier version of its previous glory.  It's weird because if you eat it while in its melted state, it tastes fine, but if you wait until it has re-solidified, it tastes terrible. Any insight?
","The simple answer is that when the chocolate liquifies, the different ingredients in it can separate.

When they make chocolate, they are sure to emulsify it with proper mixing of ingredients or by using an emulsifier. An emulsion is a mixture of ingredients that don't traditionally mix well, so as to blend them into one consistent mixture. But once the chocolate melts and the different ingredients are no longer held firmly in place, they can start to rise and sink, splitting into different layers, like a layer of fats, a layer of sugars, a layer of cocoa, etc. Not being evenly mixed causes it to taste a lot different.

Think of the difference in taste of eating thanksgiving dinner, and putting thanksgiving dinner in a blender and drinking the whole mixture of foods together.",eli5

There is a wide variety of caliber and grain count.

For those that do, having something between you and the bullet, however small could still eliminate a small portion of the velocity. Making a round that your body armor could not stop into a potentially non fatal hit. Also, objects tend to redirect the trajectory. A small influence has the potential of making a round miss by a lot.

2m3gs7,Why do defensive players get tired during a football game faster than offensive players? My father always gets angry when sportscasters talk about how high paced offenses lead to defenses getting tired. He cant figure out why the offensive players don't get just as tired. Anyone have a simple explanation for this?,"Since no one has commented on the line so far;

The offensive linemen, for passes at least, just need to impede the progress of the defensive linemen enough to allow the quarterback time to throw. In a run play, the o-linemen have to push the d-linemen to a specific place, or get in between them and the ""hole"" that the running back runs through.

Where as the d-linemen have to push/juke/spin their way past the o-line in as little time as possible in order to have a chance to either 1) find/sack the quarterback, or  2) analyse the play and find out where the running back is going, and trying to catch him.

Also, generally, the o-line out mans the d-line 5 to 4 or 5 to 3, this means most o-linemen will have help from their ""neighbors"" in stopping or pushing a d-lineman. This results in a ""double team"" on that d-lineman, which believe me is painful, terrifying and exhausting. This double teaming also helps when the o-linemen have to push the d-lineman on a run as I mentioned before. Plus that second o-lineman can then ""pass the d-lineman, who now has his weight on his heels and is considered ""on wheels""(because he is so easy to push), to go block a linebacker. Which if the linebacker is standing still, analyzing the play, is like a steamroller vs a coke can.

Add this to crack backs, pre-snap movement and lead blockers, and you can see why, for linemen/linebackers at least, it's way more exhausting being on defense than offence

Different propellers have different characteristics. I'm no expert on wind turbines, but in aircraft, changing the number of blades affects the thrust produced at different engine powers, the weight of the propeller (and therefore both the weight and the centre of gravity of the aircraft as a whole), and the noise produced by the propeller.

I'd imagine that the 3-bladed wind turbine that's become a common sight has been designed that way as a compromise of the power that can be produced compared to noise, for a given range of most likely wind speeds.",eli5

91v3tn,Why do humans sometimes involuntary void their bladder/bowels when scared? ,"Well, bladder control seems like a simple task but  actually presents a significant neurological challenge to coordinate. 

Information about bladder wall distention is used by the body to gauge levels of urine in the bladder and is sent to the pontine micturination center in the brain stem. This region coordinates the signals and mechanical coordination of urination. 

This region can be suppressed by the prefrontal area but under cases of stress a ‘fight or flight’ response can generate signals in the limbic system that will override prefrontal suppression. This is can induce incontinence especially in a population with weakened bladder control (young and old). 

This is probably just be an inconsequential failure of coordination with little evolutionary control to correct. Although we could speculate that it is easier to run away from a predator with an empty bladder. It would be interesting to see if other species display this same behavior. 

Bowel control is more complex but the process is analogous.",eli5

Unless they can prove they have enough child care expenses (and other deductions) to exceed the standard deduction, they will be paying the same amount of tax as before. Wealthier individuals typically have things like mortgage interest and property tax which easily push their deductions over the standard deduction, thus more deductions will continue to lower their tax liability.

The article also details how tax deduction in general help wealthier people since they affect the highest tax bracket the individual is in. So if you give a $1000 deduction to someone whose income pushes into the 40% bracket, they'll save $400.

bmsjg8,- how is it that pot eases or stops nausea/vomiting but can also cause cannabis hyperemesis syndrome or cyclical vomiting? ,"Biologist here!

When THC hits the brain, it bonds to special forms of dopamine and serotonin receptors that the body uses to trigger vomiting and nausea. Since opiates are very dopamine like, they can bond to these receptors as well, causing nausea.


But when THC bonds to it, it attaches to it without actually activating it. This blocks the bodies nausea chemicals from forming a bond until the body can send the enzyme to break it down.


THC, for a reason were not too sure of yet, also bonds to receptors inside the intestines that trigger reflex nausea and vomiting, but with the thc stimulating the receptors without triggering its switch in the brain, the puke signals are over powered


We think that when the thc bonds to the gut in normal people, we get nauseous but the brain being stimulated by the THC takes priority, it blocks out the puke signal and we go about our high,

But as a tolerance builds, the liver and brain find a faster way to break the THC off of the puke receptors, allowing the vomiting signals from the gut receptors, a place the brain receptor enzyme has no effect.

Since the “high” becomes shorter and shorter and it takes more and more thc to effect the brain, CHS and vomiting can be triggered by THC still in the blood but metabolized from the brains chemical receptors, allowing the gut signals to say “PUKE HOMIE!” And the brain say “ON IT BRO”",eli5

A lot of soldiers of both countrys died to defeat the third reich in WWII, but there are still right wing movements in these countrys that use the flag and other symbols of the nazi time like the ss runes and such.
I can understand when some people say america first, but what drives citizens of the USA or Russia to wear even uniforms of the very foe they defeated under so heavy losses in order to stop hitler et all?

Edit: Thank you all for your nice answers. i realized i blew it out of proportion with the ""so many"". I would like to thank /u/Miliean for his answer which remembered me to look at things from different perspectives in order to better understand them.","There's not THAT many when you consider the number of people who do this as compared to the general population.  They're just very vocal, so it appears like there's more of them.

The next thing to think about is what those uniforms and flags mean to the people that wear them.  It's very different than what it means in Germany.  These people don't think of those symbols as symbols of a foe they defined in wartime and took many losses fighting.  Those people see those symbols as symbols of white pride and white nationalism.  

Remember.  Today we think of WW2 as this ideological war, but that's really not the case.  The western powers were perfectly fine allowing Hitler to spout his rhetoric and kill his own people.  It's that he invaded the rest of Europe that caused the war.  So it's not that they really cared that he was racist it's that they cared when he infringed on their territory.  

It's even worse in the US.  The US did not really give 2 shits that Hitler invaded Europe.  They only became involved in that war when Japan attacked the US. Many would argue that the US would have gotten involved eventually anyway, but the fact is that the US got involved when they were directly attacked, not before. (other than some minor side involvement like providing planes to Canada).  

So today we think of WW2 as a war of ideology but the truth is it was a war of aggression.  It's the aggression that the allied powers opposed not the ideology.  So it's not super surprising that the ideology has lived on in the US through the symbols of the Nazis.",eli5

Why don't they produce or manufacture major goods for export? Why don't they try to emulate the U.S. (Or any other major developed country) to increase their economic output?","I'm not massively versed in Mexican history, but I can add a few details which might help. 

To start with Mexico as an independent country is 50 years younger than the US. It didn't break from Spain until the early 1800s (I think it was 1820 or 21, but I'm not positive).

On topic though, Mexico has had a lot of problems, many of which date back to before it was even a country. To begin, it was founded by Spain, and for about the entire century leading up to independence, Spain wasn't exactly a powerhouse of global wealth or might. So right off the bat, they're not on the same footing as the colonies which would later become the US. 

Following independence, they had a pretty rough time politically and economically. In 1846 there was an absolutely disastrous war with the United States, which ended with Mexico losing like a third of its territory. Then in the early 1900s, there was a revolution in the country which lasted for more than a decade. Following that, there was even more political repression and economic mismanagement. Today meanwhile, the country is gripped by drug wars and corruption. 

Edit: As for why Mexico can't just emulate the US or other developed countries, it's because that's really hard. You can't just magically create jobs and internationally competitive businesses. They lack the industrial base that many more wealthy countries have. The US is huge and has tons of resources. Much of Western Europe is small, but they made a massive fortune via colonialism. Mexico meanwhile spent most of its history either in a state of chaos or as someone else's whipping boy. 

Even worse though is that poverty is a self-perpetuating cycle. If you're a brilliant Mexican, you don't stay in Mexico and improve the country, you move to America or Europe or Asia and get rich because opportunities are so much better there.",eli5

220pei,why exactly does water hurt electronics? ,"Semiconductor reliability engineer here. 
   
Water has various bad effects on electronics.  My answers here are focused mostly on integrated circuits, since that's my main area of knowledge.   
  
1. Causes a ""short circuit"" or electrical ""leakage"". Instead of following the wires it is supposed to, it travels along the water. This can cause malfunctions, and can even lead to some things seeing too much power and being destroyed. Pure water is mostly nonconductive, but by the time it gets anywhere that matters the water is rarely pure any more, having picked up ionic contaminants.  
  
2. Corrosion. Water can make things ""rust"" (oxidize). Copper is particularly susceptible, but other metals can be corroded as well. This might not cause immediate failure, but can eventually cause conductors to become ""open"" (don't conduct enough electricity) or make poor contact to other conductors. It can also cause physical failure of things like metal capacitor housings, although that's fairly rare.  ICs used to have a major corrosion mechanism caused by leaching out phosphorus from the dielectric glasses, but P isn't used much any more. And Cl contamination would cause somewhat similar problems when water carried aqueous Cl onto the part, but Cl contamination levels are now so low that this risk is almost gone. Br is in somewhat the same boat as Cl. 
  
3. Integrated circuits nowadays have some porous layers inside of the IC that are used to make up insulators (""low-K dielectrics""). Moisture can cause these materials to swell and crack, causing opens or even shorts. This is a relatively recent failure mechanism that didn't exist 10 years or so ago.  
  
4. Many integrated circuits are not moisture-proof (they are ""non-hermetic""). Water can fairly easily get inside of them. If this happens when they are turned off, it can lead to bad things when they are then powered up and the integrated circuit chip gets very hot very quickly. The trapped water can turn to steam and expand, causing the packaging to rupture, sometimes violently. This is called the ""popcorn effect"" in the industry.  It really isn't much of an issue once the components have been soldered onto the printed circuit board, though. 
  
5. Dendritic growth. Moisture + metals + voltage + contaminants can cause metals to migrate in a pattern that looks like the [roots of a tree](_URL_0_). These dendrites can grow until they cause short circuits.  
  
There are a few others, but these are the biggies.  
  
(1) can happen right away. (3) tends to take a little time, (2) takes longer, and (5) can take a long time. (4) is variable and depends on whether the chip is high power or not; once the part dries out it is not a risk. And the main risk of #4 is when the board is going through soldering processes, since the temperatures get pretty high and they go up fairly rapidly. It isn't much of a risk to a consumer, usually.",eli5

2. There were people who knew that the Earth was round *wayyyyyy* before the Renaissance.  In fact, flat-earthers have been a joke for quite some time.  Part of it is just a societal willingness of disbelief in scientific data.

3. Some people are hard-wired in the belief that ""seeing is believing"" and yet what we often see are lies/conspiracies.  You and I may think this is contradictory, but in essence there is a degree of solipsism in their thinking.  *I* need to see it for myself, for only *I* can truly determine whether or not something exists.  Get real!

4. As another user pointed out, just simple boredom/rebellion.  Why don't they just sail to the ends of the Earth to find out?  Because they aren't actually *that* ignorant and/or are probably too lazy and deep down they know that they actually do not believe that the earth is flat.",eli5

Irises are very complex designs, look at your eyes in the mirror, see how there are millions of details in a small area? It would look weird as hell if they were just a single color all over. So they print tiny halftone dots near or on top of each other, and from a distance you can't see them.

16z79p,"Why is displaying the Confederate Flag considered socially-acceptable? I seem to be missing something, because I often see it being displayed on bumper stickers and other signs. I live in Utah, so it's not like I live in the South. I know that some people just consider it to be a symbol of Southern pride, but it seems like a huge middle-finger to me. Why not find some other symbol that isn't also linked to slavery and treason? 

I feel like it's impossible to separate that symbol from racism. It's like, if someone insisted on getting a swastika tattoo and said, ""I don't mean it as an anti-Semitic thing; it means 'good luck' in many cultures, after all!"" Like, I totally wouldn't buy that unless that person was raised in a religious tradition where the swastika had deep, immutable meaning before Hitler came along. To me, it would seem like a thinly-veiled excuse to be an anti-Semitic piece of shit.

Or, to put it another way, the excuse of ""Southern pride"" seems like a euphemism for pro-slavery, much in the way that Southerns complaining about the North ""destroying their way of life"" was a euphemism for ""we want slaves, ok?"" They don't want to come out and say it, so they say ""Southern pride"" instead.

Like, it's unfathomable to me that there can even exist an explanation for this. Where have I gone wrong?","The Confederacy was not inherently evil, they were just unfortunate to stand by a choice that, by modern standards, is evil.  

At the time, the United States wasn't all that united.  They mostly saw themselves as a individual states, much like how the member states of the European Union are still very unique.  Because of that mentality, the idea of the federal government calling the shots was resented.  Why should someone in Illinois decide how someone in South Carolina should live?  For example, let's say the Federal Government wanted to go to war with the United Kingdom.  The states bordering the Canadian/American border would probably not like the idea because their economy might rely on border trading, and because those are the state where the war will take its toll.  Unfortunately for them, if all the other states vote yes, then they're fucked.  So, this is a situation where a state like Texas, which has no ties to Great Britain nor are they anywhere near the Canadian border, can really screw up everything for a state like New York.

The South's economy relied on slaves.  The South's industry was not as strong as the North's, and so they relied on agriculture, and therefore slaves.  The North did not need slaves, and in fact most northern states had already banned it.  So, if the federal government banned slaves, then it really wouldn't affect the North, but it could destroy the South.  There were more representatives in the Northern states, so such a law would pass.  So here is a situation where people in the North had the power to destroy the lives of the people in the South.  This is why the South seceded and why the Civil War started.

The only reason why the Confederacy is seen as evil is because the main issue that the North and South did not agree with was slavery.  It could easily have been something else, such as taxes, or foreign policy, or Indian policy, or anything other than slavery, but no, it had to be slavery.  Naturally, any side that chooses slavery would seem evil to us, but that's just how the cards fell.  In the end, many Southerners did not see the Civil War as a fight to keep slavery, but as a fight to give themselves the power to govern themselves.  So, that's why displaying a Confederate flag is not seen as racist.  It is a reminder to Southerners of when they stood up for themselves.  In a way, they fought the good fight, but for the wrong reasons.",eli5

Sending a rover to mars is one thing. Sending men is entirely in a new league in terms of costs. You have to deal with lots of new challenges! Challenges that take lots of research and development to overcome, which takes crazy amounts of money and time.

A one-way trip to mars takes several months. Going there and coming back would take well over a year and a half. What are these people going to eat, when we can't send them any provisions? Taking that much food at once would be impossible with today's technology, our rockets aren't powerful enough (Water is an easier problem, it can be recycled from their urine like in the ISS). How are they going to survive the crazy amounts of radiation out there in space? How are they going to keep their mental sanity in check when they have to stay for so long in an enclosed space, with very few distractions? How about their physical health? Bone and muscle deteriorates very quickly in zero-g.

Many of these challenges have been discussed and there are possible solutions. Extra food could be sent BEFORE, in an unmanned pod to be retrieved later, which could be landed or stay in orbit, so they'd only need to take half the food. TV and ebooks could be streamed to them from home. They could have threadmills like in the ISS. Radiation would need a whole new kind of radiation shielding not yet developed. 

The ship would need to be massive to allow you to take all the fuel you need to return, and the food and water. Also to allow a little privacy for the occupants, and the equipment necessary to purify water and air.

It may be obvious that its just less expensive, but some times they wouldn't even have the actors be in the same room.  Is there another reason to this other than money?","It's an odd but incorrect belief people have that CGI is less expensive than physical sets.
It's not.
CGI is outrageously expensive, being tens of thousands of dollars (depending on the studio contracted) for a single minute.The more CG a movie has, the more expensive it will be. You can look at every major release and there's nearly a direct proportional relation between cost, and CGI usage.
You'd be surprised what isn't actually CG in many modern films.
The Hobbit, unfortunately, overused it to a gross degree.
It's hard to know the mind of every director, but what CG does is give you very fine control.
With physical sets, you have to plan them out, do takes until you get it right, with the actors laying around costing money. After you are finished, and you want to do something different, you need to set it all up again.
With CGI, it's simply throwing money at an animation studio to get a different shot. And you can get whatever you want with no physical limitations.

But it does tend to be noticeable, doesn't it. Directors like it, actors absolutely hate it, consumers are becoming more and more annoyed by the overuse, but I don't see it slowing down anytime soon.",eli5

20bino,"How and Why Does Countersteering Work on a Motorcycle? At low speeds, turning the forks left makes the bike turn left.  At higher speeds, turning the forks left will make the bike lean and turn to the right. At what speed does that transition take place and how is it figured? Does tire size, bike geometry, weight, etc. factor into when the transition takes place?  Is the transition gradual or sudden?  If gradual, is there a certain speed where I could have the forks turned but be going straight?  If it's sudden, and I quickly accelerate from a dead stop with the forks turned, will the bike snap from one direction to the other possibly launching me off (highside)?","This is an example of angular momentum, which is one of the most fucked up and counterintuitive things in all of physics.  Very cool demo of it [here](_URL_0_).  A spinning mass generates a vector of angular momentum which points out its axis.  This vector acts normal (ie perpendicular) to forces which are applied to it.  The magnitude of this vector increases with the rotational speed of the mass (ie if the wheel in the video spins slow nothing happens but when the guy cranks it up it starts to behave strangely).  In the video gravity is acting down, however the vector points out the axis of the wheel and therefore the wheel stays perpendicular to gravity.  Any force which is applied to the spinning mass will generate this reactionary force perpendicular to the force vector applied.  

So when your bike tire is spinning fast enough (ie the magnitude of the vector is large enough for the angular momentum effect to be observed), if you attempt to turn your wheel to the left, the perpendicular reaction by the angular momentum is to *lean the whole bike over* to the right.  It is the lean that makes you turn, not the turning of the handle bars.  Note that at low speeds the angular momentum vector is tiny and therefore this effect is negligible, so the motorbike steers like a bicycle.

Disclaimer: I have never driven a motorbike but this is how this was explained to me, and since I think angular momentum is cool I worked it out in my head.",eli5

What really is best and why? ,"It depends on the battery type. Phones laptops and newer electronics have lithium ion batteries. Older stuff has Nickel Cadmium.
The older style batteries had what is called the memory effect, so if you recharged them when they were half empty, this became the new zero after a while and your battery would only last half as long.
Therefore the recommendation as to deep discharge as much as possible before recharging.

Lithium Ion batteries don't tend to do this as much and can be recharged at any level provided you stay above about 20% and below about 80%

Neither battery likes to be left permanently charging at 100% so try and avoid overcharging where possible.

A car battery is an entirely different thing and provided you don't run your lights all night should live a normal life recharging itself as you drive.

My professor gave this same demonstration of how placing the key fob under your chin increased the distance it could reach your vehicle.

His explanation was that the signal the key, or antenna, generates radiates omnidirectionally, or in a sphere centered around the key.  By placing it under your chin, you alter the way the radio antenna behaves, changing it from omnidirectional to a directional antenna, so that the waves bounce off our body and merge with the waves going away from our body in one direction, effectively funneling them further away than they could reach just going out in all directions.  The shape of the waves goes from a sphere to more of an oblong shape facing one way.  We aren't adding any power to the strength of the signal, just altering the direction the signal travels in.

To sum up the article: it seems that there are microscopic channels in our taste buds that send signals to our brain, letting us know whether things are bitter or sweet. 

These channels seem to react better when food is warm. So when your tea is hot, your taste buds are very good at detecting the sweetness of the sugar. When your tea is cold, your taste buds are not as good at this, so more sugar is needed for the same sensation of sweetness. 

This applies to beer as well: as the beer gets warmer, your tongue gets better at detecting the bitterness in the beer, which is why warm beer tastes more bitter than cold beer. 

According to that logic though, tea should get sweeter AND more bitter as it gets hotter. I would guess, though, that there is a point of diminishing returns on heat, that is different for different tastes. Bitter might reach a maximum detectability at room temperature, for example, whereas the maximum detectability of sweetness might be higher.",eli5

250pss,"how did the roman government work? Were they a democracy? I mean, there were emporers, but also a senate? I don't get it. Was it passed down by succession?","In the Republic (think 400-50BC), there were two important legislative institutions: the Senate and the popular assemblies. Membership in the Senate wasn't elective; there were wealth minimums and a sort of respectability criterion. The official who decided who could be in the Senate was called the Censor. The rules about the popular assemblies changed all the damn time, so let's not go down that particular rabbit hole.

Either the Senate or the popular assembly could enact laws, but the Senate had more prestige, a religious significance, and the power to choose the most important magistrates: the Consuls.

Two consuls were elected every year. They had a number of different roles and powers, but the short version is that they were the leaders of the Senate's debate and they could command armies. After their one-year term was up, they would be assigned a proconsulship, which typically meant that they would serve as the governor and military commander of a province.

There was also a special-case office that the Senate could elect a man to, called the Dictator. A dictator could be appointed for a six-month term, during which he would have absolute powers. During the early Republic (before the second Punic war), dictators were appointed for emergencies like barbarian invasions; during the late Republic, powerful generals simply forced the Senate to appoint them dictator, and then dictator-for-life.

Julius Caesar was one of those dictators-for-life, but his enemies in the Senate, famously, saw a loophole in that ""for life"" part and stabbed him to death. But Caesar was so popular with the commoners that his postumously-adopted son, Octavian, managed to set himself up as emperor.

Now, the details of that revolution are pretty complicated, and this post is getting longer than I really like, so I'm going to skip how-it-happened and focus on what ""becoming emperor"" meant.

Octavian was in a situation where he personally controlled the majority of the military, and especially the majority of the military in and around Rome. So when he suggested that the Senate choose him as Consul, and also as Pontifex Maximus (the chief priest), and then, afterward, make him Proconsul of not just one province, but all the important ones, they didn't have much choice. Oh, and he personally owned Egypt, and no Senator was allowed to visit there without his approval. It was around this time that the Senate added ""Augustus"" to Octavian's name, which is how he's usually referred to in histories.

And that being emperor entailed: holding several important political offices at the same time, including all (but one) of the offices that involved commanding troops. On paper he was just an unusually powerful official in the republic.

When Augustus died, maybe the Senate had a chance to go back to the way things were, but they didn't, and they elected Augustus' stepson Tiberius to all the same offices. In theory, that was how it worked for every new emperor until Diocletian. But really, the Senate seldom had much choice: they elected either the dead emperor's chosen successor, or, when there was no chosen successor, there was usually at least one general who was happy to visit Rome (with his army) to nominate himself.",eli5

2rk5hm,Why is there a 'sonic boom' when reaching the speed of sound? ,"Sound is a compression wave in the air.  Air molecules fly one way until they bounce into more air molecules, which get knocked into more air molecules, and so on.  The speed of sound is the speed at which these molecules can bounce into each other.

If you're traveling slower than the speed of sound, then you push the air in front of you as you go.  It flies forward and hits the air in front of it, pushing the air out of the way before you get there.  This is the ""whoosh"" of wind when a car or train or whatever goes by you at high speed.

But if you go faster than the speed of sound, you're traveling faster than the air in front of you can hit the air in front of it.  So the air in front of you has no warning that you're coming - it's just floating around, doing air-y things, when WHAM suddenly a plane slams into it!  And the plane keeps going, slamming into more air as it goes.  That creates a big compression wave at the front of the plane.  The air is finally able to move to the side and get away from the plane, but before it can do that it's been significantly compressed.  So it moves to the side as an area of compressed air, a compression shock wave.  When that shock wave reaches your ears, you hear it as a boom.",eli5

jr2zs,"What factors cause a double dip recession? Hopefully a perfunctory explanation of a recession precedes the explanation of a double dip recession. What economic factors lead to a double dip recession?

(Optional) - Has it happened before? Are there factors that would lead a second dip not to occur (i.e. save us from a double dip)?","Simply put, there is no confidence in the economy. Consumers refused to spend because they aren't confident that they can maintain their income levels in the long-term, and firms will not invest because they are not confident that they can produce a profit. Lack of consumption and investment halts the economy and causes a recession.

Also its important to understand what a recession is actually defined as (by economists). A recession is two consecutive quarters of decreasing GDP of a nation. A quarter is just three months. So this means that for the past 6 months, we have been producing less and less as a country. A double-dip recession means that we have experienced a recession, then went through a quarter where we experienced increased growth, then back down to 6 months of decreasing production.

In terms of economic factors (to finally answer your question), government stimulus and consumer/investment confidence are key factors that help prevent double dip recessions. Spending is the only true way out of a recession as it helps increase the flow of money around the economy. So to prevent a double-dip recession, everyone must spend. 

Of course, no one wants to do that.",eli5

3skv1e,increasing the federal minimum wage to 15$ an hour will cause inflation,"More money in the system = higher prices

Economics 101.

Think of it this way.  If a person is paid $100 a day, then they can consume $100 a day of goods and services... but if you increase their daily income to $150 a day... then they can consumer $150 worth of goods and services.

Since these goods and services are relatively fixed in terms of supply (they can make more cars/tvs/whatever but that takes time) businesses will raise prices to reflect the increased demand for their product.  That rise in costs is called inflation.

This has lead to a number of people saying that raising the minimum wage accomplishes nothing, as inflation will knock out the growth of wages.

The part that your Facebook Friends aren't accounting for is that this is never a 1:1 ratio.  A 10% rise in the minimum wage does not mean a 10% rise in inflation because not everyone is getting that increase.  So a 10% rise in the minimum wage might generate a 3% increase in inflation... resulting a 7% net gain for the worker.",eli5
3d7ibm,why can my laptop easily load videos at 1080p but struggles to load other videos at the same level or even lower? ,"Not enough information to answer properly. Do you mean 1080p downloads or 1080p streaming? If you're talking about videos being played from the hard drive, then it may be that the 1080p video is of a lower bitrate or in a more compressed format. Just because something is higher resolution, doesn't always mean it will look better or be of higher quality. When a video is compressed for downloads, its often rendered at a low bitrate. To most people, this will look fine and all they care is that it is 1080p, but to someone with more knowledge of the subject, they may see the problems with compressed 1080p movies. YIFY for example, compresses the video to a small size, meaning you can download movies quickly and take up little amount of storage, but keep a decent quality. However, a blu ray movie will be much larger and look better, despite having the same resolution. 

Think of it like this, two artists are given two identical pieces of paper to draw the same picture, but one is given a really nice set of paints and the other is given plastic brushes and cheap paint. In the end, both are the same size and look similar, but one was able to achieve more detail and the other has less. This is like bitrate. Higher bitrate video has more detail, but takes up more space on a disk or hard drive. Lower bitrate video has less detail and can cause blocky or grainy video, but takes up a significantly smaller space on your storage. The benefit of lower bitrate aswell is that it is less demanding on your laptop since it doesn't require it to read as much data per second.",eli5
1ektqh,"if the human body regenerates every single cell within it every seven years, then why do tattoo's remain throughout our life? does the pigmentation get copied by new cells?
does it just stain the flesh itself  &  seep through?
[here is the source for the seven year regeneration information.](_URL_0_)

/u/thisisntnamman explained quite well  &  has the most upvotes, here's the answer:

""Your skin has layers. The two big ones are the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the highly cellular one with lots of cell division and shedding. The dermis is blow that layer. It is not nearly as cellular. There is a lot of non-cell connective tissue, fibers and elastics that hold skin together and support all the other little organs in skin. (Latin of the day: epi = above, or above dermis)

A tattoo doesn't put ink in your epidermis. So skin division doesn't effect it. The point of the tattoo needed is to drive the ink below your epidermis into the dermis. Not into any cells but into that fibrous tissue between cells (there's a lot in the dermis). Once there it's stuck. There isn't much cell division or circulation or fluid movement to wash the ink out. So it stays there for a long time. Oh it will degrade, some ink does shed, the dermis breaks down as we get older. So you do loose the vibrant colors and fine shapes.

Henna is an example of ink into the epidermis, it looks pretty but is shed off after only a week.""","Your skin has layers. The two big ones are the epidermis and the dermis.

67684w,"Why was tenure created, and what is the controversy around it? ","Tenure was created to protect professors from being fired for political reasons.  College campuses are often the centers of culture and political movements, and professors are often deeply involved in those things.  Even when they're not, it's a professor's job to research often controversial topics, write on them, and teach students about them.  Professors are granted tenure after working for the university for a period of time, usually like four to six years - sometimes *much* longer - and after publishing books for the university.  They're reviewed by the dean of their college and granted tenure.  Tenure is an official way of recognizing the value of the professor, and as a result, granting the professor some immunity to prosecution for political actions.

For example, say you're a biology teacher at a religious university.  It is *your job* to teach evolution.  Even if you don't teach it as factually true, it's still your job to teach the students that it is a theory that exists.  It's also your job to teach about sexual reproduction, since that's an important part of biology.  But a very conservative religious university may not appreciate you teaching things that go against their beliefs.  A professor would want to have tenure, so they can say, ""This is what needs to be taught, this is what I *will* teach, and you can't stop me because it's my job to do it.""  Or consider a professor writing a book about sexual reproduction and evolution.  They're not writing it for that university, they're not doing their research on the university's dime, but they're doing it because researching and writing is what professors do.  The professor publishes this book and the university doesn't appreciate it because, again, it goes counter to their beliefs.  But the professor has tenure because, again, they need the freedom to pursue knowledge and not lose their job over it.

Once a professor has tenure, it's much more difficult to fire them, for *any* reason.  The idea is that you could *say* you're firing them for some legitimate-sounding reason, but secretly you're firing them because of their political beliefs.  So tenure is a broad protection.  You absolutely can be fired if you have tenure, and you can have tenure taken away.  But it's much more difficult.  It also pretty much guarantees that professor will have a position at that university for life, giving them a lot of job security.

TL;DR: Professors *earn* tenure when they prove they're worth it, and it grants them more freedom by guaranteeing that the university can't fire them except for a very good reason.

Public education tenure is a little different.  The core idea is the same, but the execution is a little more extreme.  Because of the bargaining power that teachers' unions have, public teachers are granted tenure pretty much universally after two years of teaching, and that's it.  Have a pulse for two years, be a teacher, have tenure.  It's also *much* more difficult to revoke tenure for public educators, and much more difficult to fire them through tenure.  This is almost entirely because of the strength of teachers' unions that fight to ""protect"" teachers but [personal opinion] end up protecting miscreants and existing solely to perpetuate their own existence.",eli5

9cpbcm,"Why do our eyes sometimes block out or not see something we're looking for, even though it's rignht in front of us? *right not rignht",">  Why do our eyes sometimes block out or not see something we're looking for, even though it's rignht in front of us?

They don't. Because your eyes don't ""see."" Nor does your tongue ""taste"" or your fingertips ""feel"" or your ears ""hear."" 

Your sensory organs are just that -- organs. They don't have any more intelligence to them than your liver or your lungs. 

All of the information received from your sensory organs is processed by your brain. And your brain is remarkably good at filtering out sensory information that you don't need to be aware of. Think how frustrating and distracting it would be if you were always consciously aware of, say, the texture of the fabric of your clothes against every inch of your skin or you had to think about *everything* in your field of vision *other than* say this text you're currently reading on a screen. That stuff is irrelevant to what you're focused on so the brain filters it out of your sense of touch or vision or hearing or whatever. It's still there -- light is still reflecting off those objects and hitting your retina and twiddling your optic nerve. Your brain's just filtering out most of that information from your conscious attention. 

This is what's known as [selective filtering](_URL_0_) or [selective attention](_URL_1_), and it's super important to your functioning. So important that when there are *chronic* problems with it, it's usually a symptom of a mental disorder like schizophrenia.

However, you can have acute issues with selective attention, usually just because your mind is focused elsewhere. When you are looking for your sunglasses and you find them on your face, it's usually because your mind wasn't *really* focused on finding your sunglasses, but probably on catching the bus or whatever was making you so frantic to find them in the first place. So your brain was filtering for some other problem (""Catch the bus, dummy!"") instead of for what you were hoping it was filtering for (""Where are the damn sunglasses?!"") Usually when you stop and focus your attention your brain re-filters the sensory input and you find the damn sunglasses sitting on your stupid face. \**facepalm*\*

That's a simple ELI5 example, but of course your brain, your attention, and your consciousness are complex systems, so it's not *really* that simple.",eli5

If you go to bed later and wake up later than you are used to, your body is tired because you've thrown it off of what it's normally used to. The reason this happens is because your internal clock for sleep is disagreeing with your body, and this causes internal confusion and you feel tired.

2igyag,"Why do I hear a click in my headset when I turn the lamp on, which is connected to the same outlet as my PC? ","When you turn a switch on it closes a circuit, allowing electricity to flow. 

With simpler electric devices such as lamps, the switch is usually physically closing and opening the circuit, which can cause a small arc to form when the contacts are getting close to each other, kind of like how you get a static shock when your finger gets near a metal doorknob.

Such arcs create a quick pop of electromagnetic (radio) discharge.

Since headset/speaker wires are often very thin, they are especially sensitive to electromagnetic fields in the environment. The ""pop"" from the lamp switch induces a current in your speaker wire, which you hear in your headphones as a clicking noise. 

You can sometimes observe the same phenomenon by having your cell phone close to your speaker wire and sending a text message - if you're lucky, the radio waves coming out of your phone will induce a current in your headset that comes across as sort of a low-pitch buzzing or beeping noise (at least, that's how my cell phone sounds)",eli5

Rubbish isn't a fluid. Sewage and water mostly are, with floaty or clumpy bits in the former.  So you can use gravity and pumps to quite inexpensively make them ""flow"" from the source to the destination.

3rrbon,"What is kettling, and why do police use it against violent protests? I saw a news article mention something called kettle zones? ","Kettling is a police tactic designed to solve a specific problem. Often, people will take advantage of protests to start riots. When they do, small groups of criminals break off and loot, steal, or attack people or buildings. Once a crowd is spread out and the tension is high, these things generally happen.

So the police came up with a way to herd an entire protest into an encirclable space, like a bridge or a low-value street or park. They contain everyone, that way there is no broader damage. In principle, there is a police checkpoint where you can pass to leave the protest, but in practice the police will not let you out unless they are 100% sure that you aren't going to commit any crimes on the way out - so in effect, basically no one is let out. After 3-6 hours, the police feel everyone will be too exhausted, hungry, thirsty and desperate to pee to cause trouble and will quickly disperse.

It's been a practice that's faced sharp criticism. In a legal sense, it's detention without cause - for anyone in the area, whether they were looters waiting to happen, individuals expressing their desire for political change through peaceful protest, or just people who happened to be nearby. It's also viewed as a violent counter to peaceful protest, a means of discouraging mass protests against the policies of the state. Plus, if things do turn violent and you didn't want to be involved, you could be stuck in a bad situation and possibly seriously hurt.

Yet, and this is important, we do not have an alternative to kettling once a protest gets angry enough to bring out the looters and rioters. We can prevent ourselves from needing it if police and protesters can view each other as friends, but that's difficult to achieve on both ends. Occupy Wallstreet in New York was a great example of a protest movement that was police-friendly, and the police handled it in a perfect textbook way in New York. At the same time, the London equivalent turned quickly violent due to differences both in the protest culture and the police culture on protest.

If you have a program that's saving a bunch of documents on a Mac, and you open the folder where it's saving those documents in the Finger, you'll see them appear as they're written.

In early versions of Windows, once you opened a folder in Windows Explorer it didn't automatically refresh unless you pressed the Refresh button.

For quite some time that was supposed to have changed - Explorer windows were supposed to refresh automatically. In practice, though, it's been buggy - there have been numerous circumstances that can cause the window to not refresh when it should.

There's no really good reason why it has to be that way. Windows certainly has the capability of monitoring its file system, but it's been buggy - so they left the Refresh button there.

4gcsps,"How come there's lots of 'zero calorie' drinks, but no 'zero calorie' foods?","There was another ELI5 before, but the basic reasoning was this:

Beverages consist mostly of water, which in and of itself, is calorie-free.  It's a blank canvas and pretty much has no taste, so it's easy to ""doctor up"" and flavor with minimal amounts of anything else.  What is water, anyway?  Two hydrogen atoms mixed with one oxygen atom - pretty darn simple!

Food on the other hand, is wonderfully more complex than water.  Texture, consistency, toughness, softness, etc.  It's made up of a million and one different combinations of items with various different atoms.  These form different structures are more complex than what water offers above - and thus form protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

So with that being said - there are ""low calorie"" foods like lettuce and celery.  Although solid, most of their mass is water (and that's why they're lower calorie!)  They also contain very little in the way of nutrients as well; hell, most zero-calorie beverages contain little or no nutrients that are beneficial to the human body, too! And to put it in perspective, ""calorie-free"" typically means  <  5 calories.

tldr; food consist of more complex structures than beverages; more complicated structures = more calories.  in naturally occurring foods, the more water that makes up an item = less calories overall.",eli5

35m2qp,why is the cost of delivering my electricity so much higher than the cost of the actual electricity I used? ,"There are two costs, and it's not clear that delivery is always more expensive than production.  It depends on where you live.

Delivery charges in your power bill allow the delivery utility to recoup the costs of installing all the substations, poles, and wires that run from the power station to your house.  The more that infrastructure costs, the more the delivery charge needs to be for the utility company to break even.  Also, many of those costs don't depend on the amount of power you use, which further complicates the delivery part of your power bill.

In places with deregulated electricity, you can chose between several power producers.  All these producers use the same delivery wires to get the power to you, so they don't have independent costs for delivery.  The power producer only has to pay for their power plant, and the fuel that powers it.  Those costs are offset with the ""power"" part of the bill.",eli5
6scion,"Why do we need to sleep? And also, if our days weren't 24 hours, would we still have the same sleep patterns? ","> Why do we need sleep?

TLDR: No on really knows

Sleep is a mystery for most scientist their best theory at the moment; however, is that it's the body and brain's time to reset, recharge, and sort through all the data that was thrown at it during the day.

The best example of this is found in working out. Every bodybuilder knows you will feel today's workout when you wake up tomorrow and that's because your body builds muscle when sleeping.

In the same sense the brain builds and strengthens internal connections to memories when sleeping. (This is why a good night's rest can get you a better grade on a test rather than a last minute crunch) 

The human body takes in an enormous amount of information when it's awake and it can't handle the load of data and sort through it at the same time.

 > If our days weren't 24 hours, would we still have the same sleep patterns?

TLDR: Yes

We don't know why we need 6-8 hours of sleep...but everybody needs it at least once a day. How long you can go without sleep depends on a variety of things but generally you don't want to stay up beyond 16 or so hours.

Light, specifically blue light, plays a huge role in our energy levels. Luckily, in today's modern societies we can choose how much light we allow in our lives with blackout curtains and electricity.

The role light plays in our sleep could explain why we evolved our need for 8 hours but honestly experts still don't know for sure. Regardless, this is why in places such as Alaska where you can have months of sunlight at a time people still need a set sleep schedule. Your body also excels at making and sticking to habits so the better you are at keeping a strict schedule the better the sleep you'll have.

15sp0a,Why we need both a Senate and a House of Representatives? ,"When Americans were trying to cobble together a constitution in the summer of 1787 (to replace the already-existing constitution called the Articles of Confederation), the biggest dispute was between the big states and the small states. How should representation be determined in the new congress? Should states with larger populations get a bigger say? Or should each state get an equal voice?

The biggest state was Virginia, and their delegates at the Constitutional Convention introduced what's called the Virginia Plan. It called for a bicameral (two-house) legislature in which representation in each house would be determined by population. Obviously the small states didn't like this, and submitted a counterproposal called the New Jersey Plan: a unicameral (one-house) legislature in which representation would be by state. Furthermore, under this plan, each state would have veto power over legislation. This debate was very serious and threatened the negotiations. Finally they came up with a compromise: a two-house congress. The lower house (the House of Representatives) would have representation by population. The upper house (the Senate) would have an equal number of representatives (two) from each state. All laws must be approved by both houses. This makes both the big states and the small states happy. It made it possible for all 13 states to feel comfortable living under a more muscular constitution which would create a federal government that would have considerable power over their lives, much more so than existed under the Articles of Confederation.",eli5

That works out pretty well...

2fcuha,Why does string theory matter? ,"Physics, right now, is divided into two sections: general relativity and the standard model.

To simplify it drastically, general relativity basically discusses the physics of really big things and the standard model describes really small things. 

The problem is, general relativity takes gravity into consideration and the standard model, because of the kind of maths involved, cannot. What this means is that it's hard to mathematically join the two models, which is a problem because most physicists think we can't have two different models to describe one thing (the universe).

If string theory is proven to be correct (and in my opinion that's a very big 'if'), it basically unites the two previous models by providing an alternate way of describing them. It uses lovely things like the existence of 11 dimensions and miniscule strings that vibrate and interact with each other to create matter and energy, and therefore can describe everything.

So why does string theory matter? It matters because it's a way of understanding the universe without having to resort to two different ways of analyzing it, and to many people, it's our best chance of doing so.",eli5

711hz2,"How did mercantilism develop? Did mercantilism develop naturally as an effect of more centralised nation states, and if so, how? ","Back in the days, countries didn't really have the bureaucracy to collect taxes the way we do today, with a big paper trail where every single transaction can be traced back. For this reason, efficient and just tax collection was a huge problem in pretty much every country on earth until quite recently.

But when it comes to trade, it's all a lot easier. All trade had to go through certain chokepoints - like roads, mountain passes and ports. So all they had to do was to post a bunch of officials along those routes to collect tariffs and search cargo for contraband. Furthermore, kings often restricted what kinds of goods were produced by cities so that they could sell monopolies: If a city wanted to buy wool to make cloth, they first had to give a ruler a bunch of money. This kind of behavior goes back all the way to the beginnings of history.

For example, during and after the bronze age, palace economy was a very common model in the middle east. That meant that kings built very large and vast palaces, which housed all the craftsmen of a city. All trade with that city went in and out of this palace, allowing kings to easily control and tax the economy.

9tiytu,"Why do bikes fall over when staying still but balance while moving? As the title says, why is it that when you sit on a bike that is staying still you will fall over but when you’re moving you are able to balance the bike?","It has to do with the geometry of the front fork, and of the front wheel.

When the bike starts to lean to one side, the front wheel will steer towards that side, because of weight shifts. (*try it while holding the bike by the saddle. You can steer the front wheel by making the bike lean!*).

This does not help anything when you're standing still. But when the bike is moving, steering starts a turn. In that turn, same as when youre in a car, the bike gets pulled towards the outer side of the turn. This puts it back upright!

3w65o8,"Why is Africa so poor? It's not a resource deprived land, so I'm very curious. ","In the 1800s, European countries which had superior military strength compared to most of the rest of the world, began to conquer and claim African lands. Due to a competition land grab that developed, this became known as the scramble for Africa. By the 1900s, nearly all of Africa was part of a European country's empire- African nations were now European colonies. Under colonial rule, African nations were exploited and did not get the rewards of their labor, as whatever they made was usually shipped to Europe. In other words, Europe flat out stole much of Africa's resources. After the World Wars, European countries lost geopolitical influence and military strength, and most of its colonies were by this time more desperate for independence. Most of the colonies were granted peaceful independence, but were still tied to the artificial borders Europeans had drawn up for them. These fake borders often had rival nations in the same country, and as a result of Europeans leaving, there was a power vacuum that many different ethnic groups fought for. Because of this, civil war was common in many of the former colonies. Some Europeans stayed in Africa, and still reaped much of the economic rewards, continuing to exploit Africans. Tough dudes with a lot of military power often took over African countries as brutal dictators. These dictators were usually selfish people, who didn't help their countries grow economically. If aid was sent, the aid was often mismanaged and did not trickle down to those who needed it most. tl;dr Much of Africa is still dealing with the legacy of European imperialism.",eli5

w6zob,-  Why is the longest day of the year not the hottest day? It would seem logical that the longest day of the year would fall in the middle of Summer and the shortest day of the year would fall in the middle of Winter.,"Great question.  

Why does something heat up?  It heats up when it is taking in more energy than it is releasing.  As long as it is doing this, the temperature will continue to rise.  

The amount of energy that the northern hemisphere takes in during the day varies over the course of the year.  That energy is highest at the summer solstice (the first day of summer) and the lowest at the winter solstice (the first day of winter).  

However, notice that energy going in and temperature are not the same thing.  For instance, if you put a potato in the oven, there is a lot of energy that is constantly being transferred into the potato.  But, it takes long time for the potato to bake.  

Think of the earth as a big potato.  The heat coming in is highest at the solstice, but it continues to heat up.  There is some day later where the amount of energy it releases equals the amount of energy that comes in.  That day will be the hottest.",eli5

The Democrats made an effort in the 90s to implement universal healthcare, similar to how it was in Europe.

1akdtu,What is hard coding and why is it frowned upon? ,"Hard coding is to make a program that will make an output based on some inputs, where the inputs cannot be changed without modifying the source code for the program.

So imagine you, as a programmer, wrote an iPhone app that simply calculates the final amount to be paid in a restaurant, based on the the subtotal plus % in tips.  Now imagine in your iPhone App's program, you wrote the formula in the code like this

**total amount = subtotal * 1.1**
where 1.1 is 10% in tips.  

When using your app, the user will only have to type in the subtotal for the bill, and get the total amount.  Why is this bad?  Well, whoever uses this app will always get an output with 10% tip.  What if they want to pay 15% or 20%?  There is no way for the user to do so, short of changing the source code of your program, which they have no access to.  Even by popular demand you set the tip to 15%, your app is still not flexible as it cannot account for everybody's case and is hence inflexible.

How do we change this?  Well, we can use a variable for the tip %.  A variable is just something that can take and remember information which the program can ask for at any time.  In the app, you can then ask the user to input the % of tip they want to pay, in additional to the subtotal.  The app will then take the user's input and store it in the variable.

So instead of writing the above, you write
**total amount = subtotal * (1 + userInputTip/100)** where userInputTip is a variable in percentage that will take on a value of what you ask the user to input. 

Rather than *hard-coding* the value of 10% above, you've made the tip % *dynamic* based on the user's input.  

Is your app now free of hard coding?  No!  Why is that?  What if on top of a tip, users now want a way to calculate the final amount where a discount can be applied?  

Although app's tip % value is no longer hard coded, the entire formula is!  There are exactly 2 factors that make up the total, and these 2 factors are set in stone!  The formula is set to be **total = subtotal + tip**.  There is nowhere to account for discount.  Now you must add another variable  to ask for the user's discount and modify the formula to be **total = (subtotal * userInputDiscount) * (1+ userInputTip/100)**.   To take it really far, you can actually ask the user to input every factor and customize the formula to however they want.  But tips, discount, tax, etc is all you as the programmer can think of for now as factors that contribute the the total of a bill, so you would probably hard-code the formula to use a set number of factors, rather than letting the user input infinite number of factors that make up the formula, because at some point it will become more confusing and time consuming than it is helpful.  Hard-coding is kind a relative concept..nothing is free from hard-coding...there are always going to be things in a program that are hard-coded - and it isn't a bad thing, as long as you see that the hard coded values would not be beneficial for the user to change.

1010ub,"Why must emergency contraceptive pills be taken within 72 hours of sex? It's said that the morning after pill is most effective soon after sex, and loses its effectiveness gradually over the next few days, and it's recommended to take it within 72 hours at most.


As far as i can tell, different pills have different mechanisms of action, such as making implantation less likely, but the main mechanism seems to be that they stop ovulation. So, if the pill stops ovulation, why do you have to take it within 72 hours?


I get that it's a case of 'the sooner the better', but presumably it'd be accurate to say that an ovulation inhibiting contraceptive pill would be effective for most of a menstrual cycle? I.e. if my girlfriend and i had sex on the seventh day of her menstrual cycle, and she wanted to take the morning after pill, and assuming that her cycle doesn't change much month to month, she could potentially take it 5 days after sex, rather than the recommended-at-most 3 days?


Furthermore, if a person ovulates on the very day they have sex, surely the pill needs to be taken straight away, rather than leaving it for a day (which would seem safe enough going by the information for pills)? And even then, might it not work even if taken properly, seeing as ovulation wasn't prevented?


Is it a case of 'within 72 hours' being just a very very rough guideline, or is my understanding of egg fertilisation and ovulation all messed up","Apart from stopping ovulation, it also inhibits implantation or can stop it all together by changing the way the eggs and sperm can travel. 72 hours is doctors being careful because with medicine the rule is better safe than sorry.

6qbk3f,"Why is lie detection not a viable explanation for Linda the bank teller (conjunction fallacy)? In the experiment, people are asked to rate which statement is more likely:

1). Linda is a bank teller.
2). Linda is a bank teller and a feminist. 

Most people say (2) is more likely. The experimenters conclude that most people are irrational. 

However, we also know that a statement that contains fewer details is more likely to be a lie than a statement that contains more details. Therefore, if people are interpreting the question as:

Which of these two statements is more likely to not be a lie? 

Which I think is quite a reasonable interpretation, then the experiment's results can be easily explained without recourse to the ""everyone is irrational"" explanation. 

I've searched online and not found any criticism of the kind I'm proposing and I'm wondering if I've missed something really obvious. 

Thanks. ","You're actually confusing two quite separate things.

The point of the experiment is not to pick the statement that is less likely to be a deliberate lie, but to pick the one that is more likely to be accurate. That may sound like the same thing, but it isn't.

The statement ""Linda is a bank teller"" is either true or false. The statement ""Linda is a bank teller and a feminist"" contains two different assertions, each of which is either true or false, but independently of each other. The possibilities are these:

1. Linda is neither a bank teller nor a feminist: both assertions are false.
2. Linda is a bank teller, but is not a feminist: the first assertion is true, the second false.
3. Linda is not a bank teller, but she is a feminist: the first assertion is false, the second true.
4. Linda is a bank teller and she is also a feminist: both assertions are true.

~~If we know nothing at all about Linda~~ If we had reason to believe that whoever is giving us these facts about Linda lies on average 50% of the time, each of these possibilities is equally likely. But that means there is only a 25% chance that the entire sentence is true, as opposed to 50% for the first sentence. The first sentence is twice as likely to be true as the second sentence.

But these are relatively simple sentences containing a very small number of simple assertions that are either true or false. The principle that people are more likely to be lying if they give more details applies to more complex texts containing many assertions that have differing levels of detail in them.

It relates to texts like these:

1. Gee, officer, I can't remember that far back. It was a few weeks ago. The 14th, you say? Oh -- that was my wife's birthday. We were out celebrating. It was at that Italian place on the corner. We must have left home at six and got back around nine.
2. Why of course, officer, I remember that night well. It was two weeks and five days ago. Saturday 14th, to be exact. It was my wife's 35th birthday, and we were out celebrating. It was at ""Da Stefano"" on the corner of Main and Jefferson: I had lasagne and my wife had risotto. I spilled some chianti on the tablecloth. We left home at five fifty and came back at ten past nine.

The reason we suspect that the second statement might be a lie is that it seems suspiciously well-prepared and rehearsed. It's not that it has a greater total number of assertions in it, but that the level of detail is greater than we would normally expect a human to recall after two weeks.

EDIT: Note that the conjunction fallacy is a lot more subtle than this. Subjects are actually given quite a bit of information about Linda: she is outspoken and has taken part in anti-nuclear demonstrations. They usually pick the second statement as the more likely, but actually it isn't. If the choice were between ""Linda is a bank teller"" and ""Linda is a feminist"", they would be right to pick the second statement, as nothing is said about what Linda studied or where she works. But there's still a chance, even if it is quite small, that Linda isn't a feminist at all, so ""Linda is a bank teller"" is actually very slightly *more* likely than ""Linda is a bank teller *and* a feminist.""

EDIT 2: I've just noticed that you state that a statement containing *fewer* details is more likely to be a lie. I confess I haven't heard that one before. Do you have some kind of source or example of this?

EDIT 3: Of course, as has been pointed out to me, the chances of Linda *not* being a bank teller are actually much greater than the chances of her being one: after all, there are countless other things she could be.",eli5

7xvmkp,How does the French healthcare system work and why is it rated as one of the best in the world?,"Social security (CPAM) covers 70% of all healthcare expenses that it considers ‘suitable’. 

For example if a doctor prescribes you antibiotics, social security will pay 70% of the consultation and 70% of the antibiotics. 

However, if your doctor prescribes you Diosmine, a medication that is not considered ´good enough’ to be refunded, the CPAM will refund 70% of the consultation but it won’t refund any percent of the medication. 

The remaining 30% are paid by the patient. The patient can choose to buy a «  mutuelle », which is a private insurance company, that pays these remaining costs.

Patients with chronic diseases/illnesses are considered « ALD30 » which means the CPAM pays 100% of medical costs.

The government controls the price of medication and the price of mutuelles.

The CPAM is funded by taxes, which are more important than taxes in the USA, especially for indépendants.

A specific Mutuelle is sometimes obligatory with your job, in this case you can terminate your current mutuelle and join the one paid by your employer. Depending on the employer a certain amount is deducted from your salary. Most of the time this deal is advantageous.

8774sl,"When someone gets a head injury and suffers amnesia, why do they remember things like Math when they can’t even remember who they are? ","It might be easier to think of amnesia and the brain in terms of computers. Like your computer, your brain doesnt store things the way you tell it to. For example your brain doesnt have a ""math folder"" and a ""identity folder"" and a ""porn folder"" and neither does your computer's hard drive (your operating system presents it that way to you for your convenience). 

Like your computer all these peices of information are stored with context clues and associated in a variety of ways (indexing fir computers). 

If you were to pull your hard drive and erase a line, or blob, of data from it you would not only lose that data, but also risk corrupting other files. 

So, in the case of brain injury you might see something similar apear based on where the injury occured on the brain, and how severe it was.

This is why association therapy is so common with brain injuries. Ideally, by exposing people to context clues of who they are--things thy associated with what they lost--that person may find an alernate way to access and restore the corrupted files.",eli5

First, it literally routes data: from one computer to another in your local network, and between your local network and your ISP's network (and on to the internet). Second, it provides local network devices with their local IP addresses. Third, it acts as a Domain Name System server, helping local computers match names (like _URL_0_) with IP addresses (151.101.1.140).

To do all of that it needs to acquire and maintain its own IP address on the ISP network, and then maintain various tables in memory where all that data is stored.

When you restart your router, you cause it to wipe out its copies of existing data and restart its connection to the ISP network. This can fix several different kinds of problems, which is why rebooting your router seems like a magic fix to lots of network problems.",eli5

1mjz6j,Why do airplane headphones have 2 prongs instead of the normal 1 for most other headphones/devices? ,"Price  &  theft. Sitting still on a plane for 7 hours across the Atlantic is bloody boring,  so as early as the 1930s airlines began having music and films shown on board. Come the swinging 60s, international flight really takes off (*bad-um-tsh*) amongst the masses, so the in flight entertainment technology grew too. As early as '63, in-seat audio was available that could be heard with hollow tube (pneumatic) headphones. This is preceding the launch of the portable music player (Walkman) by a good decade and a half!

By the late 70s, headphone began to go electronic, which as we know needs that little prong to plug in. To isolate the noise from other passengers and the airplane engines, the design swapped to headphones. People on planes are static so not moving, thus size isn't really an issue. So, to cut costs, having a separate pin for each headphone side means that you can just send a couple of wires directly through to each driver in the headphones from the plug, allowing to build a cheaper headphone build. It also means the connector can be more stable and reusable in its prong, making a reusable product.

The theft/cost also involves selling them. Lets say you price your cheapy headphones at $/£/€ 5 a flight. Assuming that at least 30% of your passengers won't have remembered to buy an adapter, you've just made an extra 500 on a biggish plane selling these things, as their normal headphones will only be hearing one side of the audio, which is likely to ruin the film. Equally, there isn't much point in pocketing your headphones for the rest of the holiday as it will only give one side of audio when plugged in to your music device, so you may just leave them on the plane and end up buying another pair on the way back. 

As an additional point, planes have a slow life cycle. Despite Virgin/BA/Emirates/etc rolling out single prong inputs years ago, many airlines will be buying their old planes, with some 747s for example being in the air for up to 30 years. If the cheapo airline decides not to update the IFE system in the plane, then you'll be stuck with the antiqued technologies, and they'll stick around. Over the next couple of decades though expect it to die out almost completely.",eli5

2dmb69,Why are aircraft propellers normally pullers and ship propellers normally pushers? Most of the aircrafts powered by propellers have them such that the propeller is in front of the engine (and in front of the wings) so that the propeller is pulling the aircraft. Most ships have the propellers such that the propeller is behind the engine (and the ship). Has this got something to do with aerodynamics or weight distribution? My initial thought was that propellers in ships and aircrafts work on the same principle so I was expecting them to be mounted the same way but they aren't,"They both work identically. You can have aircraft with propellers on the back and ships with propellers in the front. However, crashing with a forward-mounted propeller with a ship would be much more catastrophic than putting it behind, and putting it slightly below the ship can mean an unseen obstruction can leave a ship powerless. The propellers have to be protected, so they're typically put at the back.

Aircraft propellers are typically in the front because the pitch of propeller planes is upwards. Putting the propellers at the front means it's got more clearance. There's also a lot of other considerations like heat exhaust (propeller in front of the plane means the heat can dissipate behind the engine and away from the plane, so the cooling system is relatively simple) and a shifted center of gravity.

Basically there's lots of reasons, but they're put that way because it works best.",eli5

Now if all movies started being at a higher fps, they would get used to it and it wouldn't negatively affect them anymore, but for now, because of that reason filming in 48fps might mean that your movie sells less.

1yiyv3,"Why are certain drugs addictive and others aren't? For example, both heroin and MDMA create effects of euphoria but only one of those is addictive. Is there a separate chemical process?","Yes, actually there is a separate chemical process. Heroin is a prototypical narcotic; it works by affecting the part of your brain responsible for doling out feels of reward, contentment and joy. It forces your limbic system to release enormous amounts of dopamine, your 'happy chemical.' As far as I know, it's not very common to run out of enough dopamine to get high. So eventually one starts to crave that reward every day as the limbic system adjusts to it, and then once it has you, the withdrawal becomes a bigger fear than what might happen as a result of heroin use. And to be honest, I think heroin's addictive qualities are slightly overplayed, but then again, ask most habitual heroin users and they'll give you the ""could quit any time"" spiel.

Here's where MDMA comes in. It works on another, similar chemical in your brain called serotonin. Ask anyone who's used both MDMA and heroin, they'll tell you it's a different sensation but the principle of getting high is the same. Only thing is, MDMA tolerance skyrockets with regular use (not sure about heroin) and unlike dopamine, it's possible to deplete so much of your serotonin through MDMA use that future doses become too weak to be satisfying. So because you have to wait for serotonin to regenerate and because the active mechanism doesn't involve raping your dopamine systems, it has much less potential for abuse.",eli5

The companies were distinguished by the colour of the horses they rode - either grey or black. Thus there were mousquetaires gris and mousquetaires noirs. Cavalry have no use for clumsy muskets, which are difficult to reload at the best of times. The problem we have is an over-literal translation of the French which loses the context.

2frn2k,Why are the bones in our forearms split while not in the upper arms? ,"The two bones are what allow us to rotate the wrist laterally. 

To see what I mean, 
1. Hold out your right arm in front of you with your thumb pointed up (12:00 position). 
2. With your left hand grab your right arm just above the elbow. 
3. Notice that you have no trouble rotating your wrist so that your thumb is pointing to the left (9:00 position). You can do this without any rotation of the upper arm at all. 

You would not be able to do that if you just had one forearm bone locked at the elbow. You could bend your arm at the elbow, but not rotate your wrist in that way. 

To feel the two forearm bones rotating around each other, grab your forearm with your left hand while you rotate the wrist.",eli5
a5j6jv,What is superconductivity and why is it a big deal that it happens at room temperature? ,"Conductivity is how easily electrons move across something. The lower the conductivity the more work you need to put in to push the electrons through.

Copper has a high conductivity for instance (a lot of metals do) and thats part of why we use it for wires (that and cost). Wood has low conductivity, so does air.

Super conductors have super high conductivity, they barely lose any energy (to heat mostly) and you dont need to push hard to get the electrons across it.

This makes them awesome for electrical technologies and reducing how much power you need to do complicated things. The catch has always been that we needed to make things super cold in order for it to work.

To have one at room temperature means we could maybe actually use it in a commercial technology one day, and that would be awesome.",eli5

Is it caused by visual influences, the composition of their diet, something else entirely? And how do these factors alter their dna?

Well, the changes happen because children are not perfect copies of their parents. They're a random mix of their own parents, and something about them can be completely random, something new altogether.

Those new random changes are called mutations. Living things with mutations are called mutants.

The mutations are changes in genes, genetic info that's passed on to later generations. Genes are made of molecules called DNA.

So... sometimes, mutant mantises are born. If the mutants are good at what they do, they'll be more successful hunters, and leave more baby mantids. Then there will be a new generation of mutants that'll spread and so on.",eli5

What happens if there are serious injuries? ,"Mosh pits are areas of playful violence that typically occur at punk rock, heavy metal, and metalcore concerts.

The standard pit simply involves people [running around and bumping into each other](_URL_1_). This is the standard at traditional punk/hardcore/crust shows but may be found elsewhere. It's interesting to not that the dynamics of pits change depending on how dense they are, too. I've been at shows where it's just a couple of people running around and I've also been at shows where people are so tightly packing that you can hardly move at all. It is not uncommon for movement in a pit to organize itself into a circle, at which time it becomes a...

""[Circle pit](_URL_2_)"", which is literally just people chasing each other in a circle and trying not to get trampled.

If you're at a metalcore, new york hardcore, beatdown hardcore, or contemporary post-hardcore show you might run into a pit that consists of ""hardcore dancing"". This involves a lot of fake karate and punching the ground and stuff like that. [It appears to have evolved from the ""slam dancing"" that was and still is common a punk shows](_URL_0_). Hardcore dancing is taboo at traditional punk and metal shows.

While there is mosh pit etiquette they are not safe (especially if you're short and/or skinny) and people do get injured in them.When I saw Napalm Death/Municipal Waste in 2012 I got my nose broken (but, at the same time, that's the only serious injury I incurred after years of moshing). This danger is part of the appeal.

Mosh pit etiquette as I understand it: 

1) If someone falls down, pick them up. 

2) If someone drops something (glasses, etc) pick it up and get it back to them (or simply hold it above your head so they can reclaim it) 

3) Don't mess with people who aren't moshing 

4) No punching, kicking, throwing elbows (unless you're hardcore dancing, apparently... I don't go to those shows though so I'm talking out of my ass a little) 

5) The point of moshing is NOT to intentionally hurt anyone, just to roughhouse a little. People who enter pits looking to fight are assholes.",eli5

Multiple factors... and you must keep in mind that these can vary a lot between person to person.

""Pharmacokinetics"" - what the body does to the drug.

- Degree of absorption of the drug from your gut into your blood stream can vary due to a multitide of factors (food, drink,  diarrhoea etc)

- How quickly your body breaks down (metabolises) or gets rid of (excretes) the drug can vary from tome to time, though variation in this is more relevant between different individuals rather than within the same person. Many different factors can influence the concentration of free (effective) drug in your blood stream at different times and physiological states.

- Drug-drug interactions, some drugs may induce a higher rate of metabolism of other drugs, vice-versa. Some drugs may induce a higher level of excretion of other drugs, vice versa. What else are you taking?

""Pharmacodynamics"" - what the drug does to the body 

- Produce tolerance... sustained high levels of the drug in the bloodstream may ""desensitise"" tissue receptors (in this case, your brain cell's receptors) to the effect. Higher doses of the drug are required to produce the same effect over time.

- Use of stimulants concurrently doesn't help the sleep medication in its cause (caffeine is the main offender).

Poor sleep hygeine

- TV

- Reddit

- Caffeine

- Gaming

-Basically any mentally stimulating activity before sleep

Psychiatric factors 

- Anxiety (+++++!!!)

- Depression

- Psychosis

qb780,Why is outsourcing a good thing? Why do some people consider it bad?,"I like to always start with my credentials, or reason that I can answer this question.  I have been in business for along time and am part of a global business leadership program plus studied business at the Univ. of Connecticut.  I also worked as a manager in an outsourced contract center in Mexico.

In cost accounting we attempt to break down the cost of a product.  Take any product, say a lollipop.  The are material costs (the candy, the sticks, the wrapper).  There are labor costs (the guys who run the machines that make this, the guys who pack it etc).  Then there is GSA (general selling and administrative expenses).

A business leader seeks to maximize gross profit margin, that is the amount of money applied to the operating income after the costs of goods is subtracted.  When the business leader analyses the costs that go into making the lollipop they may find that the labor costs are contributing a disproportionately high percentage.  The decision may be made at that point to lower labor costs by sending the labor to an outsourcing center, where the labor cost per unit will be considerably lower.  The idea is to increase the gross profit margin.

It does not always work but in a labor intensive operation it usually can if managed properly.  It is really just a matter of mathematics when it comes to whether or not it is a good deal to do.

Now for my personal opinion. In  most cases I do not feel that outsourcing hurts America. In many ways the argument can be made that it helps America.  The majority of jobs that are sent overseas are non-skilled.  This does two things. It keeps consumer prices down, which is good for the economy overall and it forces the American people to seek new and better ways to earn a living.  I do not want the next generation to depend on a vocation that can easily be done by unskilled laborers overseas. I would rather they learn a skilled labor vocation.

Now people usually automatically react to outsourcing as stealing American jobs.  I can say that at one time I was a partner business owner that manufactured a product where the contribution margin was razor thin. We wanted to keep the business in Houston, TX.  It was absolutely necessary to keep labor costs low. We posted job positions for line workers and material handlers at the labor cost that would sustain the business and received no responses form ""typical Americans"". Our only choice was to either move the manufacturing south of the border or not be in business at all.  We did not go into business to fail, but to make profit for our stakeholders.  We ended up hiring first generation immigrants who were willing to work for the lower wage.

Remember that in the labor market workers only have one of two things to offer:  a special skill or the willingness to do something that anyone can do for less money.",eli5

25w9yh,"why do pain pills get you high if they are ment to just kill the pain? Also how do they get you high? Pain pills as in hydrocodone, oxycodone,opana etc.  ","We naturally have brain chemicals called ""endorphins"" that get made if you hurt yourself. If you stub your toe, a few endorphins will be made. If you get hit by a car, a lot of endorphins will be made. (By the way, you can cheat by doing something very hard, like going for a super long run.)

Now, endorphins do two things. They kill pain, and they make you feel good. Ever heard of a runner's high? This is what causes it. Now, I'd bet that feeling good actually helps with killing pain. It might still hurt some, but you're not freaking out, so it doesn't get worse. Also: a big part of why pain hurts is that people are upset by pain. Some illegal drugs, like PCP, don't get rid of pain, but they make it so that you aren't upset by the pain. So that's why endorpins give you that high. They're making it so you aren't upset by pain. (btw, endorphins don't do this the same way as PCP, but that's another topic.)

Certain pain pills (narcotics) work because their molecules have the same shape as endorphins. This means that when they go in the brain, the brain acts like they're endorphins, the pain goes down and you get that high.

You can't do anything to get rid of that high without changing how the drug works. It either pretends to be an endorphin, or it doesn't.",eli5

I did notice that in the morning, if I listen to a song, the rythm seems a lot quicker compared to me listening to the same song in the evening. I wonder how that happens.

To maybe answer this question, you probably are still awakening from a deep-sleep cycle in which you were basically a plant while once you're awake, your body has a better sense of time.

As was in the article, it was ranked 72nd in the world last year, and 36th this year.","Vancouver is surrounded on three sides by water, mountains, and the American border. That means that people who want to move there can't just buy a new house for cheap on the border of the city, unless they live way to the east and drive a long way.

Instead they have to compete with other people to find housing, which drives up costs.

You'll find that many of the most expensive places to live for ordinary people are surrounded by water or mountains: NY, Seattle, San Francisco, Singapore, etc.

Places that are not bordered by water or mountains tend to sprawl, rely on cars more, and be much cheaper: Phoenix, LA, Las Vegas, etc.

3h4pik,"why does _URL_0_ never get taken down, if all their other domains do? It's fairly well-known that The Pirate Bay changes TLDs quite quite regularly, as its domains get seized by whatever country's TLD it is under. For example, the most recent one taken down was _URL_0_, but it's currently available at _URL_1_, .vg, .am, .mn, and .gs.

Yet at the same time, _URL_2_ has been going strong for a long time. How does it never get taken down, when almost every other domain has?","It's because .org is a generic topdomain that isn't owned by anybody, so it's free to use without getting taken down. 

However, most countries have a ISP based block towards _URL_0_, so TPB choose to go out searching for other domains, like country based and mostly small countries that aren't that advanced in technology to get the most value out of the domain. 

They then use the .org to re-direct people to whichever domain they are currently using, so that you, as a customer wouldn't have to always get to guess or having to research what domain they are currently using, while at the same time they are avoiding most blockings towards their website.

Therefore, .org stays the same, but the actual domains for the website keep changing.",eli5

Airplane seatbelts are used far more frequently than automobile belts and the clasps must be able to handle being used many more times than those in a car.

And lastly, they're easier to access and operate in an emergency. The flat plate, covering the entire front of the clasp, the simple motion to open it, the large slot and very easy to insert tab are both simple to operate and simple to demonstrate.

I'll give it a shot - although I'm not an expert on the subject. 

Israel is our only real friend in the middle east. When I mean friend in the international sense, I mean that..no matter what differences you two might have, you'll never been enemies. You'll never launch missiles at each other.

The Arab nations are cordial..but, are always at arms length. This is by both their designs and our own designs. We often times do not share each others value structures or worldviews, but we find mutual beneficial relationships and build on them.  But at the end of the day, one Coup or bad election and the US is totally on the outside. There are people in the middle east who are hardliners against the US. They leverage their positions with oil and would like to see us completely out of the region.  There are a number of reasons...some valid...some bullshit...but they exist. 

Because they exist, we want a solid friend in the region. 

It is something of a Catch 22 in that - because Israel exists and we support them... then a lot of the Arab hardliners want us out of the middle east. But don't be fooled by the Rhetoric...they'd want us out even if we didn't support Israel.",eli5

6m6jqj,"If heat rises, why is it cold on top Mount Everest?","Short answer is basically just air pressure. 

The closer you are to Earth's core the higher the pressure. Imagine it as when you are swimming underwater and how your ears can start to hurt if you go much deeper. That's because the pressure increases. Effectively when you go deeper in the ocean you have more water above you pressing down on you and the opposite is true so as you get closer to the top of the water there is less water above you and less pressure. Same principle applies to the Earth's atmosphere. Imagine an ocean of air molecules. The closer you are to the top (space in this example, I guess) the fewer of those molecules there are exherting pressure down on you. So, one of the properties of air is cooling as it expands when moving from high pressure to low pressure. Heated air molecules rise until they reach a point where they begin to expand due to lower pressure and they cool down. Mount Everest happens to be way the hell up there so it makes sense that it just expands the air/ water molecules so much that things hit a freezing point and we wind up with snow.

I am by no means involved in the study of this stuff but I'm certain that tgis is at the very least ""accurate enough"".",eli5

Ice is frozen water which many people associate with *cold*. But not everything that is cold is water. Bread has some water in it, that's why a little ice can form on it when frozen. But that frozen water goes back where it came from when thawed so there is as much or as little water in it when it's back to room temperature. 

Additional fun fact: when bread goes stale it feels unpleasant and dry but in fact it caught water. Condensation makes the starch molecules in it swell up so that you feel them more in your mouth and that makes it feel dry and stale.",eli5

You are at your most vulnerable when you are asleep. You are effectively unconscious and many of your senses are non-responsive or at least sort of 'muted' as it were. This means that when you wake up at 2:30 in the morning because you heard a bump downstairs, or a loud howl of wind, your mind goes into overdrive because the 'threat' could be quite a lot closer due to your unconscious state. You need to be ready for a fight just in case. Your brain isn't perfect and it can sometimes relay that fear to other, non threatening but still stressful situations.",eli5
1nuk03,Why do people hate Obama Care? ,"Well you're asking two questions.

1.  Why don't people like Obamacare?

2.  Why don't doctors like Obamacare?

Doctors have some issues with it in that it expands Medicaid coverage, and Medicaid has some heavy-duty bureaucracy and its payments aren't well designed, this hurts doctors' bottom line.

Obamacare also creates a board of people whose purpose includes reducing some payments to doctors (for things they feel are currently paying too much)

Obamacare also means that a lot more people are going to have health insurance.  That is usually viewed as a good thing, but we currently have a severe nursing shortage and a bit of a doctor shortage.  More patients won't help that.

There's also a concern that Obamacare will add so much red-tape to the process, that doctors' hands will be tied in some care decisions.

The other question, why don't *people* like Obamacare is different.  The vast majority don't really understand what Obamacare actually does.  And our two political parties have been stretching the truth considerably about it (either for or against)

They are taught to fear it by the republicans, and to cheer it by the democrats.  It is my opinion that Americans are much more quickly to believe politicians when they say something is bad, then when they say something is good.",eli5

1sxgnq,"Hi Reddit. What is Privatization and why is it bad for a Country? I am a Mexican living abroad and have got all those privatization news about Gas and Oil. Everybody back in my Country are in a state of panic and disappointment and most people speak of what a terrible outcome this will have, but I am not so sure why and how bad can it be. I feel I cannot formulate an opinion because I honestly have no idea how privatization works. 

Thank you Reddit... !","As it stands the Mexican government maintains all the pipes and electric wires / power stations etc.... using money from tax and bills.

It costs so much to run the system (buy in fuel, build new power stations etc...) and then any profit that is made is either invested back into the system or put back into the government for other public services.

When things are privatised one or more companies own everything. 

Now naturally they should do everything the government did, but they will also have share holders who expect profit. To ensure their business is making profit they either cut corners or increase bills.

There are also local concerns. If it costs $400000 to upgrade an area with only 15 customers the government will if it is needed, the private company won't unless it is forced to.

Businesses will only make decisions that profit them in some way in the future. 

Government run systems are for the people.

Simply put:

Privatisation delivers the same but costs end users more because they have to make profit

Privatisation can increase efficiency because the company will want to try and deliver the same for less and will look to work smarter

Privatisation hurts the little guy often because its hard to justify spend if its not going to give a good enough profit.

Many people argue that if something is essential to a country's infrastructure it should remain owned by the people (government). 



Both systems have there ups and downs and to be honest if i had the call to make i would outsource things from time to time rather than privatise (outsourcing means that the government still owns everything but pays outsiders to manage it all, the profit/terms of the agreement is set by both parties in advance, but importantly the government retains ownership and once the contract is up (say 10 years) it can do what it wants.)",eli5

The joints were sealed with big rubber ring-shaped seals - the O-Rings. When the rubber was exposed to sub-zero temperatures for a long time it became brittle, less flexible.

During launch the pressure on every part of the ship is, you can imagine, enormous. The O-Rings cracked (because they were so brittle as a result of the sub-zero temperature at launch) and burning fuel escaped from the side of one of the SRBs. It acted like a welder's torch and cut through the strut holding the SRB to the side of the External Tank. The SRBs were held on by two struts - one at the top, the other at the bottom. When the bottom strut was destroyed the SRB pivoted on the top strut, which sent the top of the SRB directly into External Tank. The ET was just as the name says: a giant tank, filled with enormously-explosive fuel under tremendous pressure. When the ET was ruptured the fuel expanded into a gas - the big round white cloud you see initially in the footage.

A point and shoot digital camera might mention a 5X zoom. Typically in 35mm equivalent, it will be something like 30mm-150mm. Meaning that it starts as a slightly wide angle lens, and zooms in through normal and on to a maximum of about three times magnification.",eli5
2jcopw,"Why do the jovian planets have ring systems, but not the terrestrial planets? ","Basically it all boils down to how massive they are.  With more mass, they can attract more moons.  More moons mean there is a greater chance of collisions (which would break apart the moon), or a greater chance of one of those moons drifting into the ""Roche Limit"", which is the closest a moon can get before being torn apart by gravity.  

Terrestrial planets *can* have rings, and may have even had them at some point in the past.  There is a dwarf planet in our solar system with rings: _URL_0_.  Mars may get some rings in the future if one of its moons wanders a little closer.",eli5
1ossaa,"Why do I want so much sleep? Lately, I have been sleeping for a good twelve plus hours. Is that too much sleep and why am I suddenly sleeping a lot?

Edit: to add I do go to bed at 9pm or ten","Possibly several causes, although every person is different.

Firstly, you may have inconsistent bedtimes. You mention going to sleep at 9 or 10, but if you ever have nights where you stay up really late, even once a week, it is enough to make your body try to compensate with extra sleep. Heck even varying your sleep time by an hour every night can throw you out of wack.

Secondly, freedom from morning obligations. You may just not have anything requiring you to wake up. So your body is taking advantage of the extra hours for rest. There are not that many things that the body likes more than rest. And when you consistently give your body that extra time, it will take it. This then becomes a routine that your sleep cycle adapts to.

Third, your age and body might actually need those extra hours. 8 hours is usually the MINIMUM recommendation for adults. Teenagers, adolescents and children usually need much more than that. And even adults function better on 9 hours or more a night.

Lastly three somewhat related things: mood, diet, and exercise. Lack of exercise leads to excessive tiredness/more sleeping. Bad diet can contribute to a lack of energy which in turn equals less activity/exercise which equals more sleeping. Mood is affected by your feeling of energy and activity, and a sleepy mood equals a sleepy body.

This isn't an exhaustive list (pun intended), so take it with a grain of salt. Lifestyle changes like starting or stopping medications can also effect sleep, but I assume you would have mentioned such a change in your post, and likely would already have been informed by a doc or pharmacist of possible adverse sleep side-effects.

While you have claimed you don't suffer from depression, I would caution you to watch out for warning signs, and take action to stop from becoming depressed if you see any. Depression could result as a consequence of your lifestyle/sleep cycle. Our mood is often very intimately tied to our physical bodies. And sleep plays an important role in our physical and mental fitness.",eli5

3qnxx9,Why organs for donations are kept on ice during transport and not heat? After all the recipient and the organ will be warmed up eventually why not just keep it warm?,"A couple reasons.  Bacteria has a harder time thriving in the cold.  Normally, your body keeps bacteria under control, but when the organ is outside the body and away from an immune system to protect it, that bacteria has free rein to grow and damage the organ or colonize inside and infect the recipient later.

As well, it slows down the metabolism of the cells of the organ.  The organ doesn't stop doing everything it's supposed to do just because it's outside a body.  A heart tries to keep beating, livers try to keep filtering, etc.  They're *still alive*, which means they need all the things necessary to keep living, like energy and oxygen.  But there's no body to supply oxygenated blood to them.  So cells are going to die as they suffocate and starve.  By keeping the organ cold, you slow all those processes down so the cells in the organ need less oxygen and less energy, so far fewer of them die.",eli5
1k36ou,"Why do divorced men ""lose everything in the divorce"", why aren't all assets and money divided up evenly? Why don't women have to pay the man? ","First off, I've never actually heard of a man literally ""losing everything."" Unless there is a prenuptial agreement, the default is just to divide the assets up equally. This is because marriage is supposed to be an equal partnership between the two spouses. Even if the man makes more money than the woman, the law splits the assets evenly because it is assumed that both spouses contribute to the household in different ways. Traditionally, men were breadwinners and women were housekeepers and raised the children. Under the law, these two roles are considered equally important, which is why the woman would be entitled to an equal amount of the assets, even if she wasn't making as much money. Think about it this way: if the woman is raising the children, that means the family didn't have to pay a housekeeper or nanny. So in an economic sense the woman was contributing to the family by saving it from housekeeper and nanny costs.

Then there is alimony. Many times, women would forego education or building careers of their own because the men were the breadwinners in the family. So after the divorce, the woman didn't have a career of their own or a means to earn a living. So alimony payments were designed to give the woman some income until she could reboot her career. Depending on what role each spouse plays and who makes more money, alimony could also go the other way (i.e. from the woman to the man).

Then there is child support. Whichever spouse gets control of the children is supposed to receive child support payments from the other spouse to support their upbringing. Traditionally, it was usually the women that got custody of the children, so this was another payment that went from the man to the woman.

If these payments weren't in place, there could be a situation where a man decides to divorce his wife to run off with some hot new thing. The woman would have been totally unprepared for this, and she could become destitute and be out on the streets. The law thinks this is a bad outcome, so it ensures some protections.",eli5

Now that Obamas presidential run is almost over, CNN is accusing him of lying about the raid and saying that the US tipped off Pakistani Generals and threatened to cut out arms supply so that they would fake it. Media is saying that Bin Laden was held in the same prison by Pakistan for 5 years.","If you're referring to the Seymour Hersh story that broke Sunday, that is not ""the media,"" it's one guy with some dubious claims. Media outlets are reporting on the story according to their own biases.

Hersh has had kind of a spotty record, he has done some excellent investigative work in the past, but these days, he seems to be tripping more and more into fantasyland. His entire story rests on the uncorroborated claims of two dubious guys.

His story does not dispute that bin Laden was killed, but rather the circumstances around it. Basically, the claim is that the ISI (the Pakistani version of the CIA) had got their hands on bin Laden back in 2006, and had been holding him at the Abbatobad compound since then (with Saudi support) to use as leverage in dealing with the Taliban and al Qaeda. The US got tipped off to that, and cut a deal with the ISI to let us come in and kill him.

Although there are large parts of Hersh's account that don't hold water, that is not the same thing as confirming the official story is correct. In particular, there is *no way* bin Laden could have been living a mile down the road from the Pakistani military academy for years without some protection from SOMEBODY high up in the government. And any story that rests on the CIA being extremely clever and resourceful is automatically suspect: they are the Keystone Kops of the intelligence world.",eli5

17gcji,"Why do Baptists and Methodists hate each other? I have been to Texas, and this seems like a real thing.  These sects appear to genuinely dislike each other.  Is there a deep theological divide or is it a feud of similarity? ","Disclaimer: I grew up methodist.

Methodists and Baptists differ on a lot structural details concerning Christianity. For starters, Methodist churches are typically part of a larger organization. Similar to the catholic church, pastors are assigned to congregations by higher ups. The congregation typically gets a sort of veto power, but in the end it means that the pastor you grew up with probably won't be the one you have later. In fact, they typically rotate every 4 years. It has it's benefits, but also it's downsides. 

Baptist churches are largely more independent. They choose their own pastors and it's essentially at will employment. There are Baptist organizations, but they are more for purpose of working together rather than governance. This is why there are different types of Baptists (Primative, Southern, Free Will, etc).

 I was baptized when I was 14 after going through confirmation, but it's fairly common for Methodists to baptize infants.  Baptists believe only adults and teens may be baptized. Methodists also don't really care how you get Baptized, as long as it happens. Most do ""sprinkling"", but some do it other ways. I went to a baptism at a farm where it was done with a hose (because it was funny). Baptists can only do it via immersion, I think. Not entirely sure, but I know they are picky about it.

At the more spiritual level, Baptists believe that once you are saved, you are good to go. No matter what, you can't fall out of grace once saved. Methodists believe that you can fuck it up. If you get saved, but then go back to being a dickwad, you lose it. Typically, Methodist teachings revolve around actions speaking louder than words for this reason. 

In the more general and public sense, Methodists are typically not very fundamentalist. My church invited a representative from Planned Parenthood to visit and talk to the youth group about safe sex and then the youth leader explained that it is important to remember that sex should be with someone you love (he emphasized he DID NOT imply marriage). There were gay youth leaders from other churches at the camp we went to (Lake Junaluska, NC). And typically, we were less concerned with the minutia.

Baptist, TYPICALLY, are more fundamentalist. I'm sure there are exceptions, but I don't know of any.

8wdun8,"If brains use electricity to send and recieve messages, why do EMPs not shut down brains?","The answer has two parts:

1.  EMP's have an effect on metals.  The EM pulse is a pulse - a rapidly-changing electric and magnetic field, and because of [induction](_URL_0_), it causes mirrored electric and magnetic currents in metals in the vicinity.  Electronic chips have a lot of thin metal wires in them, and even a little bit of static electricity (1 volt going the wrong way) can fry these sensitive wires / chips.  That's what the EMP does.

2.  The brain (neurons) don't have metals and don't use electricity in the way you imagine (electrons moving through metals).  If you look at a [basic explanation](_URL_2_) of a neuron firing, the neuron cell creates a moving wave of extra sodium^+ ions, followed by potassium^+ ions; it's more of a chemistry pulse than an electrical pulse.  But, technically, you do have ""charged particles"" (the ions) moving down the length of the cell, so technically you do have an ""electrical current"".  But it's really a chemistry pulse, and once it reaches the end (the dendrites), it activates neurotransmitters, which are purely chemical and not electrical at all, to actually signal into the next neuron cell.

So, TLDR, neuron transmission is chemical.  This is why human [reaction time](_URL_1_) is a quarter of a second (1/4th of a second), rather than speed of light (electricity would move at the speed of light, and speed of light from your head to your toes would be 1/100,000,000th of a second).",eli5

Also, kind of related, if you look in a different direction than ""normal"", would that make it noticeably harder to think of whatever you wanted to think of? Taking the example of looking up and left when remembering imagery, if you instead looked down and left would there be a mental block or something that would prevent you from accessing these memories? ","As far as I know, it goes like this: we look to the left for past real events that we want to recall and to the right for imagined scenarios (things we made up about the future or the past). Furthermore, we look up+left to recall visual memories, straight+left for auditory memories, and down+left for inner talk. We look up+right for scenarios we described or imagined happening, straight+right for imagined dialogue we had with ourselves or others, and down+right for feelings. Apparently, it has to do with the way our mind stores and recalls events, but I don't know more about that.

5rn65n,Why can't we cut our body fat directly?,"Fat is difficult for the body to process because it isn't water soluble, but stores energy very efficiently (compared to glucose, it stores about twice the energy per gram). It is stored in adipose tissue, whose purpose is to store fat and cushion/insulate organs. Because of those things, fat doesn't want to leave adipose tissue, and when it's forced to, it does so in small amounts to keep your blood from becoming lard. Fat is used for energy as a last resort, it's the least efficient aerobic process our cells use to make energy, and your body will start consuming your muscles before it starts consuming fat. This is why diet is so important to burning fat. If you keep taking more in, you can't burn it off, so it gets stored while your body burns off sugars and protein first. If you take too much of everything in, you end up storing some of everything as fat.

Even if you work out, you're not likely to burn more than 2500-3000 calories per day, that should be your ceiling, if you're trying to lose weight, exercise isn't the thing that will do it best. You should definitely exercise, because it helps a bit and it's really, really good for you, but taking in fewer calories than you burn is the only way to lose weight, and unless you're a professional bodybuilder or some sort of elite athlete, you are only in control of about 30% of the calories you burn at most.

251424,"Why laughter is infectious. Why do we laugh because of other people laughing? Also, why is it so hard to stop when we know we shouldn't be laughing?","*As the researchers watched pairs of chimpanzees playing together, they consistently found that one chimp would laugh in response to another’s laughter. But this second laugh was distinct from the original laugh; it was shorter and had a different vocal quality*

*This kind of contagious, responsive laughter showed “a striking similarity to [the] conversational laughter of humans,” write the authors, who are all based in the department of psychology at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. “Both vocalizations are significantly short and seem to promote social interactions.” Indeed, the chimpanzees would play together for a longer period of time when one of them laughed in response to the other’s laugh, suggesting that their shared laugh reinforced their social bond*

**These findings suggest that laughter first emerged into an expression of positive social communication that provided our ape ancestors important advantages,” says Davila-Ross, “before it evolved to become an ubiquitous tool of human communication with not only positive functions, but also negative ones.

This was part of the inflection system English inherited from Proto-Germanic, which you can still see in other Germanic languages: German ""er macht""(he makes), ""du machst""(you're making); Dutch ""hij maakt"", ""je maakt"".

Ever since Old English however, the inflection system has been in a gradual decline that ended up changing our grammar tremendously; the results of which were Middle English and Modern English.",eli5

There are many more examples but I think those get the point across.","It's not bad to have a numerical standardization, especially when the alternative is the bewildering plethora of Pentagon acronyms. I'm expecting a weapon to be acronymed TOEJAM sometime in the near future. 

In the nuclear submarine program, the naming conventions work as follows:

*All* nuclear submarine types are called Type 09- < Roman numeral indicating generation >  < variant(optional) > . For SSN's (attack submarines) we have:

- Type 09-I. First generation nuclear attack sub. Built during the Cultural Revolution, where engineers and physicists were sent to the farms to have ""socialist values"" inculcated into them. It shows.

- Type 09-III. Second generation SSN. Entered service in the early 2000's. Quite a bit better than the first, but still too noisy.

- Type 09-IIIG. Significantly improved variant of the Type 09-III. Entered service recently (after 2010).

- Type 09-V. Third generation SSN. Under construction. Very little is known about this, but given China's technological advancements, I expect the submarine to be comparable to the *Seawolf*/*Virginia*/*Yasen*, i.e., very capable.

For SSBN's (boomers) we have:

- Type 09-II. First generation SSBN. Since only one was built, China built it just to keep up with the Joneses on the U.N. Security Council. Strategically and militarily irrelevant.

- Type 09-IV. Second generation SSBN. Far too noisy to venture out into the open ocean alone.

- Type 09-IVA. Improved variant with some better quieting and a bigger hump for carrying larger missiles. Still doubtful that this can do deep ocean patrols successfully, but, given the larger missiles, can probably strike the western United States from China's near seas.

- Type 09-VI. Third generation SSBN, also under construction. Again, not much is known, but given where China is today I expect this submarine to be competitive with the *Ohio*. Meaning it can evade enemy hunters and venture out alone on patrols with confidence. Given the even larger missiles it is expected to carry, it can strike anywhere in the U.S., even from waters close to China.

How wine tastes to you will be different than how it tastes to someone else. So it is up to you what is best for you.

Cost comes from operating costs, quality to some extend, as well as rarity and demand. A brand new french oak barrel costs $1300-$1500 dollars and after the 2nd use it doesn't impart much flavor and typically will get used as a planter. So if the wine uses any new oak that will add about $5/bottle.

Cost of the land, labor, is it machine or hand picked, is it a well known winemaker/winery? those all factor in to the cost of the wine. With that said, expensive doesn't always mean better.",eli5

","This isn't quite true: a modern high-calibre sniper rifle or a .45 magnum will kill you quick with a body shot. But if you're talking smoothbore larger muskets compared to smaller sidearms, the answer is calibre and shock.

A single musket or minie ball is very large and very heavy compared to a standard sidearm bullet, and although it typically moves slower it has a lot more force behind it. When it hits, it slams into a person's body rather than punching through rapidly like a faster revolver bullet, transferring all of its shock into the surrounding tissues and crushing them like a hit with a sledgehammer. That's enough to almost instantly kill someone when it hits them in the abdomen, at minimum knocking them out of commission until their bodies dies from the trauma. 

There's other factors such as infection and modern medical treatment, but they're more about surviving for days after the person is shot, not about whether the shot immediately stops them in their tracks.",eli5

zk1gl,why my boobies hurt right before my period. ,"Here's an explanation I found off a website.

""Breast tenderness during menstruation periods can be caused by various factors. Most of the cases, unbalanced level of estrogen hormones is the main cause for breast tenderness during menstruation periods.

The most common cause for breast tenderness during menstruation periods is hormonal imbalance. During the menstrual cycle, estrogen and progesterone levels vary in different ways. Normally, when estrogen is down and progesterone is up, breasts get bigger in size. But, hormonal imbalance could alter this cycle, making breasts even bigger, more susceptible to pain, and for more prolonged periods. Therefore, when hormones are not balanced and estrogen levels decrease more than progesterone ones, it ends in breast tenderness.

Because the most common cause for breast tenderness during menstruation periods is unbalanced amounts of estrogen hormone, maintaining healthy hormone levels is important to avoid this symptom.""

1vybbf,Why do baseball teams need coaches (managers)? i mean i understand why a football or basketball team would need coaches. They involve highly sophisticated plays. But in baseball there aren't any highly sophisticated plays. Every knows what they're supposed to do. ,"The coach’s job is to transfer as much knowledge and experience to the players to develop the most skilled athletes. The managers job is to administer the team. 

Baseball is deceptive because it involves a huge amount of strategy and sophistication, and the manager is a huge part of initiating strategy, attitude, and, importantly, crisis control. Two years ago the Red Sox manager was Bobby Valentine. A huge mistake. He had no leadership qualities, did not know how to set a lineup or respond to in-game changes. He was terrible at getting results out of his pitchers, fielders, batters. It was an ugly, ugly year. Nobody was pleased to be playing for Boston, and they finished last in their division. Valentine was fired. 

In steps John Farrel. He was instantly better with the players, allowing for a better atmosphere than the year before. As we all know, most people perform better in a good work environment. When people enjoy the place they work, they generally care more about the success of the operation, whether its baseball or building rocket ships. A good team manager will always be able to illicit the best from their team, and can expect the highest lever of performance and results. 

Think about the word coach compared to manager. In football or basketball you have coaches, whose responsibility it is to guide the players through calling plays, setting lineups and conditioning their players for the physical and mental aspects of playing. In baseball, you have all this as well, but you are also responsible for managing the team as a unit of individuals. Baseball is different than basketball or football because it is a team sport based on a million individual performances and matchups throughout the course of a season, and players go through slumps where they just are not performing as well. This has to do with the effects of a looooooong season, 162 games plus the playoffs, so a manager has to know his players and be able to determine which guy is going to perform on a particular day, in a particular role. Kind of different than football where you can expect your QB to go out on Sunday and throw the ball to the wide outs, scramble a few times, and hand the ball off the the backs. For the most part, people in football and basketball have more defined roles that they must adhere to. In baseball, its more nebulous and thus a manager is the central nervous system to the team, setting rhythms, responding to fatigue and sickness and injury, assessing and lining up future threats and counter-minding them before they can come into play...

A baseball manager has to be able to process and store vast amounts of information regarding particular pitcher/batter matchups and histories, individual performances in certain ballparks, the particular running game of the opponent, the fielding of the opponent center fielder and how that could be used to your advantage, etc...  Think of it like a business model. A manager looks at the numbers, sure, but they also have to look at the players and know who is going to defy those numbers, when needed.",eli5

35afjo,Why are John and Jane Doe used as names for unknown people? ,"Origin[edit]
The name ""John Doe"", often spelled ""Doo,"" along with ""Richard Roe"" or ""Roo"" were regularly invoked in English legal instruments to satisfy technical requirements governing standing and jurisdiction, beginning perhaps as early as the reign of England's King Edward III (1312–1377).[8]

Other fictitious names for a person involved in litigation under English law were John-a-Noakes, or John Noakes/Nokes and John-a-Stiles/John Stiles.[9]

The Oxford English Dictionary states that John Doe is ""the name given to the fictitious lessee of the plaintiff, in the (now obsolete in the UK) mixed action of ejectment, the fictitious defendant being called Richard Roe"".

This particular use became obsolete in the UK in 1852:

As is well known, the device of involving real people as notional lessees and ejectors was used to enable freeholders to sue the real ejectors. These were then replaced by the fictional characters John Doe and Richard Roe. Eventually the medieval remedies were (mostly) abolished by the Real Property Limitation Act of 1833; the fictional characters of John Doe and Richard Roe by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852; and the forms of action themselves by the Judicature Acts 1873-75.""
Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Respondent) v Meier and another(FC) (Appellant) and others and another (FC)(Appellant) and another (2009).[10]

The term 'John Doe Injunction' (or John Doe Order)[11] is used in the UK to describe an injunction sought against someone whose identity is not known at the time it is issued:

""8.02 If an unknown person has possession of the confidential personal information and is threatening to disclose it, a 'John Doe' injunction may be sought against that person. The first time this form of injunction was used since 1852 in the United Kingdom was in 2005 when lawyers acting for JK Rowling and her publishers obtained an interim order against an unidentified person who had offered to sell chapters of a stolen copy of an unpublished Harry Potter novel to the media"".[12]

Unlike in the United States the name (John) Doe does not actually appear in the formal name of the case, for example: X  &  Y v Persons Unknown [2007] HRLR 4.[13]",eli5

Some sites DO actually offer to host ads on their own servers, but these are usually large sites with a niche audience - for instance, I believe Penny Arcade does that exclusively, and when you see a video game website with full-site theme of the latest big-name game, that's what's going on.

But even then, you wouldn't use it as an under-ad image.  What company would pay for their ad to be hidden behind another ad, and only be visible to people who hate ads enough to install an extension?

Edit: When you see popups or banners about turning off adblock, they usually have a 1-pixel image somewhere on the page that's hosted by the ad network.  The page can then check if that image loaded.  You will wouldn't show ads because, again, that's pretty much the worst place/audience to show ads.",eli5

I don't get to play any minority cards, I can't afford tuition and I didn't graduate at the very top of my class.""

2w1ybc,"why is the word ""Lazarus"" so often associated with bringing the dead back to life? Examples: the Lazarus effect (2015 movie), ras al Ghul's Lazarus pit, the lazarus device in evolve, (2015 video game).","Lazarus of Bethany, also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days, is the subject of a prominent miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death. The Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life.

In the context of the Gospel of John, the narrative of the Raising of Lazarus forms ""the climactic sign... Each of Jesus' seven signs illustrates some particular aspect of his divine authority, but this one exemplifies his power over the last and most irresistible enemy of humanity—death. For this reason it is given a prominent place in the gospel.""[6]

A figure named ""Lazarus"" (Latinised from the Aramaic: אלעזר, Elʿāzār, cf. Heb. Eleazar—""God is my help""[7]) is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke. The two Biblical characters named ""Lazarus"" have sometimes been conflated historically, but are generally understood to be two separate people.

The name ""Lazarus"" is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life; for example, the scientific term ""Lazarus taxon"" denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction. There are also numerous literary uses of the term.

4e20uj,What causes people to go into anaphylactic shock on the cellular level? Wondering what B cells and IgE are? ,"B cells are a type of white blood cell (leukocytes), specifically they're lymphocytes. 

B cells are an important part of the immune system, and one of their main roles is antibody production. For allergies (like anaphylaxis) that antibody is IgE. 

An antibody is a protein that has 2 important parts - the variable and conserved regions. The names kind of give it away, the variable region is the part that recognizes/binds  the 'foreign' substance,  and has a ton of variations to allow your body to recognize many different things. The conserved region is generally the part that your cells interact with.


So, once an IgE antibody is produced that recognizes a substance, you make a bunch of them, and they end up stuck in the surface of specialized immune cells called mast cells. When you're exposed to the substance again, it binds to the surface IgE, and if two antibodies bind the substance, you get a reaction (this is referred to as crosslinking, the two IgEs are 'linked' by the substance).

 This reaction tells the mast cell that you're under attack/invasion, and in response it dumps out a ton of chemicals, like histamine (this process is called degranulation, as the chemicals are stored in granules inside the mast cell). These chemicals are what cause the symptoms of anaphylactic shock.",eli5

With this declaration, the Witnesses there felt emboldened. That, along with Rutherford's(the then president of JW) urging the Witnesses to defy the ban and continue the preaching work, lead the Witnesses to adopt a resolution that they would indeed continue their activities despite the ban. That resolution and a personal message was sent to Hitler that said, ""Your ill-treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses shocks all people on earth and dishonors God's name. Refrain from further persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses; otherwise God will destroy you and your national party."" This was before the war, and didn't go over so well with him, as is evident by history. All of this can be read in the above link.

There's no way of knowing if the outcome would have been different had they just laid low. Hindsight being 20/20, it obviously wasn't the best move to directly challenge Hitler, but in all practicality he may have been just as harsh on them anyway.

4ghyqg,Why are MRI machine so loud? Whenever I take an MRI there are always a ton of weird sounds and lots of noise. Why and where do they come from?,"An MRI scanner contains a huge magnet. However, to make images, it has to alter the magnetic field. 

If you couldn't alter the magnetic field, you could only ""see"" 1 pixel. So to make an image, you need to warp the magnetic field to focus on a different region and then change the focus, so you get multiple pixels (actually, it's more complicated than that, but that's good enough for ELI5).

So, to warp the magnetic field in a controlled way, you need an electromagnet.  Two magnets may attract or repel, depending on their alignment, so the controllable electromagnet gets attracted or repelled from the main magnet. 

This is exactly what happens in a loudspeaker. You have a permanent magnet, and an electromagnet. The electromagnet is connected to the loudspeaker cone, and the force on the electromagnet gets transmitted to the cone.

In an MRI scanner, the electromagnet isn't connected to a cone, but because the forces on it are so huge (many tons) that it actually causes vibrations through the whole body of the scanner and magnet, so effectively the whole body of the scanner acts like a giant loudspeaker.

You get different sounds according to what particular type of scan is being performed. Some scans are down a row of pixels at a time, then there is a rest period of a second or so, so that the magnetization of the tissue being scanned can reset - these give a clunk...clunk...clunk.. sound, as there is a strong vibration as the magnetic field is warped to start a line. Some scans need to be done much faster, to the magnetic field is swept backwards and forwards without a rest period, this causes a beeping sound, as the warp magnets get a sine wave signal.",eli5

393oes,"When you rev your engine just enough so that you're stationary on a hill, why doesn't the engine stall? How can the engine be spinning yet connected to the stationary wheels at the same time? Something must be slipping somewhere right?","In a clutch, you don't do this. You hold the brakes until the light turns green, then go. Otherwise, you cause very unnecessary wear on the clutch. In an automatic, your engine is always connected to the transmission, via the fluid coupling known as a torque converter. The way a torque converter works is how /u/grenade71822 explained it, to put it simply. 1 ""fan"" spins with the engine, one ""fan"" spins with the transmission, and the way they match speed is by the friction from a hydraulic fluid.

As to your question, in an automatic, the engine is running at a speed equal to the stall speed of the torque convertor, which is the speed at which the input ""fan"" matches the speed of the output ""fan"". If you are applying the gas to hold position on the hill, you are generating excessive anounts of heat in the fluid, which will burn the consumeable parts of the transmission. This causes the transmission to start slipping, and this requires a rebuild to replace the damaged components.

In a manual transmission vehicle, you have what is similar to your brakes applying friction to the engine, which then causes the transmission to rotate. If one part of the system is not moving, either something needs to break the flow of power or the engine stalls. Since the clutch already allows for some slipping, it is usually the ""weakest link"" in the chain. This causes you to burn up the clutch, or wear off the friction material needed to grip the flywheel (which is attached to the engine).

Tl;dr: Yes, a part of the system is slipping/wearing prematurely, and that part is the coupler between the engine and transmission. The described situation is very bad for either, and you should hold the brakes on a hill instead.",eli5

Surely my current engine, transmission, breaks, other complicated pieces are worth more than $2000.00. Why does the whole not equal the sum of the parts?","So first of all, its over 10 years old.  Anything in that car is hopelessly outdated by today's standards.  That's going to hit the price tag really hard.

Second, the costs of fixing your car are not only from parts.  Labor and time also play a factor.  So how much it costs to fix a car is not a good indicator of the value of a car.

Finally, because the parts value is not the value of the car.  Your tires are probably worth at least half the value of your car (assuming you've put new tires on it sometime in the last 10 years), and other parts have value if only for the scrap metal they generate.  But the car as a unit has less value because *nobody wants a car that is 10+ years old*.  The $2000 price tag is what someone is willing to pay for a car that old, so that's what its price is.  

It makes perfect sense really, why would someone pay a lot of money for a car that is 10 years old?  How much longer will it be able to go before it breaks beyond repair?  The engine is probably nearing (if not already passed) its planned life and most of the systems inside are both outdated and probably limping.

lm56e,Why is MSG so bad ELI5? ,"MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) is a salt, but with a different chemical makeup than your average table salt. MSG is used to season foods. The glutamate in MSG gives foods an ""umami"" taste, which you might recognize better as ""savoury"" -- one of the 5 basic tastes.

The adverse health effects of MSG are debatable. [The FDA claims that MSG is ""safe in customary levels""](_URL_2_). There has been anecdotal ""evidence"" (which is not evidence at all) that there are links between MSG and obesity, asthma, and even neurological dysfunction (glutamate is a key player in many of your brain's functions, especially [learning and memory](_URL_1_)). All of these claims have seen mixed results when tested scientifically, and there isn't much reason to believe causation over correlation.

In short, MSG is a salt. Just like other salt, when consumed in moderation, you should be just fine. Much of the bad attention that MSG receives is due to anecdotal evidence, and these claims often don't stand up to scientific testing.

And why does closing my eyes for 15 minutes usually relieve me of this sleepiness. Is there any way to prevent it?","Your metabolic proccess is in a deficit cycle wherein all your calories are burned before you take lunch and you wind up really needing those lunch calories to get through your day. Basically you're too hungry in the morning, and when you eat lunch, wether it's light or not, your body is sending all the blood and resources to getting that food processed and usable (sending blood to your stomach). 
Consider that the brain is a large organ and uses a considerable amount of calories just waking up, getting to work, and doing whatever work you do.

Some factors that could contribute to a lack of good diet in the morning could be lack of exercise and activity, caffeine intake, and time constraints. (Bargaining breakfast for sleep).

Some remedies to consider include:
Eating a big breakfast, wether you're hungry or not. 
Eating small meals through the day and forgoing a one time ""light lunch""-
20-30 minutes of daily cardio to boost your metabolism- this could be literally anything you want-
Consider adding some fruit or other source of glucose to your lunch for some immediate energy.",eli5

581kfi,Why can't we cover deserts in solar panels and harvest solar power? ,">  So... why don't they just cover deserts in solar panels, give me free power for 10 years and then give me some cash after that?

I have no idea why they would give you free power/money because *they* installed solar power in a desert, but let me answer your question.

One of the biggest issues with electricity is that you lose some of it when it's transported. The further you are transporting it the more is lost. Trying to generate electricity in a desert and ""ship"" it to civilization is just impractical because of the amount of infrastructure needed to be built and the loss of the electricity in moving it.

The other thing to understand is that solar is still more expensive than many other ways to generate power. It will take you 10 years to pay off solar panels for your house, but a power plant will pay for itself in less than 2 years.",eli5

In the 1980's big hair was either the poofed up New Wave Mullet (see Bono's hair circa 1984) or poofed up 80's Metal Hair, or mainstream variants of these which all involved lots of hair spray.

Then in 1991 there was a video on MTV called ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" that was by a band that was louder and better than all the 80's Hair Bands combined. And this band wasn't wearing spandex, no hair spray, no pyrotechnics, no fake drum machine beats, none of the costume ball pretense that dominated the 80's. Then there was a tidal wave of bands just like them, also lacking spandex and hair spray. It was refreshingly real and loud, and didn't require a full can of hair spray to enjoy.

8qjvvj,Why does watching climbing make your hands sweat? ,"I'm sure someone with a medical/biological background will chime in to clarify my answer/correct my answer but my understanding is as follows:

This is because eccrine sweat glands are highly concentrated in the hands, forehead and feet. They're connected to our sympathetic nervous system, which kicks in when we're stressed.  So if watching someone climb makes you nervous/if you have a fear of heights your hands will sweat as a reaction to your sympathetic nervous system kicking in. It's like how people's hands can sweat when doing public speaking or before anything in which you are nervous.

Related, I believe this is also why some people (including myself) will actually experience our feet hurting if we look over the edge of something high up. It may be a different body function entirely, but my feet will start sweating shortly after.",eli5

For example, if you combine hydrogen and oxygen (which are both gases) you get water which is very unlike hydrogen or oxygen. Chemical reactions give the products new structures, densities, shapes, electrical properties, and so on. Sometimes the product will even reflect light differently which results in a change of colour.

5nlfcl,"Why does string theory require 10 dimensions? I subscribe to the idea that the strings vibrate causing different quarks and what not but I never really understood why 10 spacial dimensions were required.
","I am not a physicist, but I once asked a physicist to explain to me this very thing. Below is a reformulation of what he told me:

What does it mean that there are more than 3 spatial dimensions, and what does it mean that they are ""curled up very small""?

Imagine you're a billiard ball, living on the surface of table where the cover is on. Above you, just barely touching you, is the bottom of the cover. Below you is the felt. You and I know your world is 3D, but you perceive it as 2D, forward/backward and left/right. You and I know that the felt is not evenly compressible, so when a billiard rolls over it in a straight line, the balls moves ever so slightly up and down. This up and down motion though, is too small for you in billiard-ball-world to observe. You don't ever think about this though, because your 2D physics completely explains all interactions between other billiard balls that you observe.


Now let's take it one step further. Imagine you're a billiard ball physicist. Just as before, your 2D physics completely explains all the interactions between billiard balls you observe. Your ""bouncing-off-bumpers"" theories explain how balls change angle and slow down when they hit a bumper, and your ""just-slowing-down"" theories explain how balls are always slowing down a little bit, even when they don't hit a bumper. You can very accurately predict where a ball will go by putting these two theories together. Many of your billiard ball colleagues are unsatisfied with this situation though. Both of these theories involve billiard balls slowing down, but the theories themselves are separate. One day, a billiard ball physicist colleague comes to you with a crazy idea. This colleague says that they can unify the two theories of billiard ball movement if you imagine that a ball slowing down results from that ball losing energy to the surface that it's directing a force against. However, this unified theory requires that there is a force pressing balls _down_ against the felt. Down is not a direction that exists! The theory only works if there is a _third dimension_.


You and I know your world is 3D and has the dimension up and down, but you, as a billiard ball physicist, cannot perceive this dimension. The hypothetical existence of this dimension though, allows for a theory of billiard ball physics that is simpler, more general, more elegant, and thus more appealing than the two separated theories.",eli5

1q4cd9,Why does feminism have such a bad reputation? ,"Because the powerful do not give up their power easily. Feminism is, simply, a desire for gender equality; under the law, in the workplace, in relationships, in general. That premise is difficult to argue against...but, equality for everyone means a relative loss of power for a few. It always does, and it's always been an uphill battle for someone demanding equality (Frederick Douglass on the issue: ""Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.""). 

At it's most basic, that's why people lash out at feminists. There are some who believe in the caricatures and straw men arguments, who do it without recognizing their own power: that feminists hate men, that feminists are bitter shrews, that feminists want handouts at the expense of men, etc. There are even a few angry feminists who *do* hate men. But, well, they've got their reasons.

But, the reason those straw man (or straw women, since none of the people arguing against feminism recognize that many men are feminists, too) are created by men...mostly white, wealthy, older, men, is because they hold power and enjoy it. They lash out, just as many whites lashed out against giving black folks the right to vote, and many fought hard to keep Jim Crow laws on the books (just as many fought to keep slavery legal before that). The interesting thing is that many of the people fighting against equality aren't the elites that benefit from it. They're merely in the middle somewhere...above the people witout equal rights, but below the elites who benefit the most.

There is a tendency when privilege is revealed or discussed for the person with privilege to become defensive, and possibly even go on the offensive (thus the shrieking nature of the Men's Rights movement; there really are legitimately areas where men, particularly poor men of color, get shit on by the system, but to go on the attack against women is often ridiculous and misguided). So, when a feminist points out, for example, that women are vastly less safe in the world, and extremey likely to be raped in their lifetime, and that the language and attitudes that surround rape in our culture (which do confer a sense of comedy and permissiveness to the idea of rape) a man might take this as an attempt to tell him how to think or what jokes he can and can't make. He might even respond with an attack on the person who calls him out on that kind of joke.

It's really difficult to see it when you live inside this culture of oppression. It took me years to begin to understand it, and I still don't really. I'm a white dude, in America. And, I've made rape jokes that I thought were funny. But, it's past time to recognize that gender equality isn't about taking power away from men (white men, mostly), it's about not holding some people down due to their gender.",eli5

He noticed that the intervals between Io's eclipses become shorter when the Earth moves closer to Jupiter, and become longer when Earth moves away from Jupiter. He realized that this is because light has a finite speed - when Earth moves away from Jupiter, it takes light longer to reach it. He calculated that it takes the light about 22 minutes to travel the diameter of Earth's orbit around the Sun, which results in the velocity of about 220,000 km/s (today we know it's closer to 300,000 km/s, but the result is impressive nonetheless).",eli5

As well in esports (or any similar irl situation) if you're shooting a projectile, you can instantly predict exactly where you need to aim to make sure the projectile and the target meet; even if the target is moving faster than you can even see.

Over time it was adopted as the Romanization system of choice by international bodies due to its ubiquity. It is also used as a tool by non-Chinese people to learn the language, and as such, a modern person who is writing about China and speaks Chinese (such as a reporter or novelist) will likely be far more comfortable with pinyin than any other system.

3z11sj,Why a lot of Americans become so passionate/aggressive about whether they are democrats or republicans.,"Lots of people in America are like that too. There's a reason that even our biggest elections have voter turnouts of about 50%. 

That said, especially at the national level, the two major political parties offer very different packages. While you do have a lot of people who are roughly in the middle, who pick and choose what they like about each party, a lot of people are also solidly in one camp or the other. If you're a diehard Republican/Democrat, then you're almost certainly going to be morally opposed to the policies of the other party. 

And of course, the more crazy you are, the louder you tend to be, which means you get more coverage. The people who don't care about politics much at all (which is honestly more than half the country) obviously don't say all that much on the subject, so the only people talking at all are the ones who are really passionate.",eli5
6i5bvu,"Why does it still feel like you are wearing something on your wrist after you have a wrist band on for a few days, even after you've cut it off? I was just at festival for the weekend and was wearing a couple wrist bands the whole time.  I just got home and cut the band off but it still feels like I am wearing the bands.  Why does this happen? ","I would've said because of stimulus adaptation and habituation of the your brain. Though i'm not really sure why it happen for days, as it usually resides after a while. 

Your brain receives information from all sensory organs in your body. In very simple terms, with this all cluttered information coming into your brain, your brain process some of those information unconsciously and decide which it present to you which stays in the background, things unimportant like the feeling of clothes moving on your skin after a while is  habituated, that is the brain chose not to put the focus on that sensory input. Which is usually what happen to most of your sensory input you're not currently focusing/using, while you're moving and touching your mouse, the feeling of touch in your fingers and palm is very active and perceivable. While the feeling of your foot touching the floor or your thigh and butt touching the seat is minimum, but since i mentioned it and you start thinking about it, you brain move the sensory input of your foot from the background to the main focus, thus you're now aware of it.

This habituation makes things feel normal, and when you removed your wrist band, you're so habituated with the feeling of wristband on your wrist being normal, now without it your brains needs to habituate to your wrist being without the wristband anymore. 

You could apply this to normal everyday life as well, for example you never wears boxer/loose underwear, then one day you start wearing one, it'll feel weird, but after a moment things feel normal and you feel it's fine, but then you stop wearing it, now the feeling of wearing tighter undies feels weird compared to wearing loose one, until it felt normal again.",eli5

1rg5st,"Why does my new computer end up lagging just like all my other older ones, despite having unprecedented computing speed and capacity? ","Raw speed and raw capacity are valid measures of a computer, but not the only measures one must use to guage 'overall speed' or 'seat of your pants' speed.  There are many different speeds within a computer.

Prior to [Solid State Drives](_URL_0_), hard disk technology really hadn't been changing in it's fundamental workings.  Sure, you can cram more stuff onto a disk, but the way it accessed it was, more or less, the same: a spinning platter with heads on top of it.

The speed of those disks, for most all home PC models, remained the same as well for many years: 7200rpm.  This creates what is called a 'bottleneck' - An area of slowness where things get backed up.

if your CPU can process eleventy billion things every single second, but is still being fed its data from the exact same hard disk as a CPU that can only process 42 million things a second, you won't really see a noticeable difference in speed by simply by watching it. This is because by the time the next chunk of data is retrieved from disk, both CPUs have already been sitting around waiting for it. Sure, the faster CPU had been waiting 'longer', but they were both still waiting; sitting there doing nothing

Much like a chain is is only as strong as its weakest link, a computer is only as fast as its slowest component, and that has most often been the hard disk (taking cd/dvd drives out of question, since those are not used as a core component of a computer, and one can easily use a computer without one).  There are other bottlenecks inside that magical computer-box, but the the hard drive speed is a good one to illustrate the point.",eli5

2p360n,Why were no CEO's arrested in the aftermath of the 2008-12 U.S. financial crisis ,"IANAL and you should read [The Illustrated Guide to the Law](_URL_0_) to learn about such things as [wiretaps](_URL_1_), [stop & frisk](_URL_2_), [self-defense](_URL_6_), [entrapment](_URL_5_) and [interrogation](_URL_4_).




However, to convict someone of a crime via trial, a prosecutor needs to 

1) Find a crime whose elements you committed all of.

2) Prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed all of those elements.

So for instance, lets look at [18 U.S. Code § 1011 - Federal land bank mortgage transactions](_URL_3_)

 >  Whoever, being a mortgagee, knowingly makes any false statement in any paper, proposal, or letter, relating to the sale of any mortgage, to any Federal land bank; or
Whoever, being an appraiser, willfully over-values any land securing such mortgage—
Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.


A federal prosecutor charging the CEO of a real estate appraisal company for appraising land at greater than its value would have to prove

* That the defendant was acting as an appraiser at the time.

* That amount that the defendant said the land was worth at the time was greater than its actual value.

* That the over-valuing was *willful*, not negligent or incompetent.

The first element is probably pretty easy to prove.

The second argument is hard to prove--It requires the prosecutor to convince a jury about what the ""real"" value of land is. 

This last element is ver important and is called *mens rea*, or ""guilty mind"". If you trip on the sidewalk and knock someone over, we don't punish you like we would if you pushed someone to the ground for the lulz. In order to prove this, the prosecutor would need some sort of document (like an email) or witness testimony indicating that the defendant knew the property was not worth as much. This is hard to obtain.

If this case is like 98% of cases, it won't actually go to trial. Rather, the prosecutor and the CEO's defense attorney will negotiate a plea deal whereby the government avoids the cost and risk of a trial and the defendant pays a large amount of money, but avoids the possibility of prison rape.

Finally, a CEO probably wouldn't actually be guilty if their firm did something like this unless it was a CEO of a small business or unless this was a major deal for the company. The CEO would have instead have maintained a company culture of doing unethical things for short-term gain and his subordinates would have committed the crimes. However it is hard to write a law against maintaining an unethical culture that isn't vague enough to allow prosecutors to just pick good/bad/mediocre CEOs [at their whim](_URL_7_).

2bpmtu,Why are hybrid batterys and ev batteries considered bad for the environment? And are Tesla batteries any better? I hear a lot of people mention that prius batteries cause more damage because we can't recycle them and the mining process. But I never hear anyone say anything about Tesla,"That idea is largely rooted in misinformation and confirmation bias, starting with the Prius.  Let's start with the sources: The first big one was the Daily Mail (original text of the article [here](_URL_3_)) which claimed that nickel mining for the Prius had devastated Sudbury's environment.  That article [was retracted](_URL_5_) after someone pointed out that the environmental damage both happened, and was cleaned up, decades before the Prius ever existed.

The second article came from CNW Marketing, which infamously claimed that the Prius was worse for the environment than the Hummer.  That article, too, was [thoroughly debunked](_URL_4_) for making faulty and biased assumptions that contradicted the literature.

Now, even though these articles were ultimately refuted and debunked, a lot of people only heard about the articles when they were initially published, and failed to hear about the retraction/refutation of them.  In the absence of knowledge of the corrections, the idea continued to grow in spite of the facts, perpetuated by people who dislike the Prius, and became uncritically accepting of any negative information about it as a result.

In actual fact, hybrids and electric cars [do have a lower environmental impact](_URL_2_), even [accounting for the chemicals released into the environment in the mining process](_URL_0_) (it more than offsets the environmental impact through reduced fuel extraction thanks to efficiency gains) and there is an [well-established recycling stream](_URL_1_) for automotive batteries.

Finally, I feel the most likely explanation as to why Tesla doesn't get hit with the same objections is because people generally see Tesla's cars as performance cars, meaning that people would be seen to be buying it for reasons other than environmental conservation, which was a reason readily attributed to Prius drivers.",eli5

2brv3f,"How do swear words become swear words? How come we perceive some words as socially unacceptable to say? How come we perceive some words as socially unacceptable to say, while we are allowed to say other, more ""polite"" versions of the same word?","It's a decision taken by society in general: when enough people agree that a certain word is offensive, that word is offensive.

Generally, swear words are either used as insults and so become offensive that way (for example, words like ""gook"", ""dago"" and of course the infamous ""N-word"", were always used in contexts that were clearly denigrating, and so the words themselves became denigrating), or refer to sex or bodily functions we consider to be unpleasant.

Of course, it is often necessary to talk about these things in serious contexts, and so we think of different words to use to make it clear that we are not trying to be offensive. For example, to avoid using terms for the female genitalia that are offensive or otherwise taboo (the C-word, for example, is used to insult men in particular), we might use the Latin term ""vagina"", which originally meant the sheath for a sword -- think about that one for a moment. But over time, it can happen that the connotation of offence that we were trying to avoid eventually attaches itself to the euphemism, and so you get stories of the woman who complained because her daughter saw a sign advertising *The Vagina Dialogues*.

A good example of this kind of connotation creep (a phrase I have just made up and am quite proud of) is our terms for the room in which we defacate. We no longer have any word in the English language -- not one that is commonly used in polite company at least -- that actually means ""room for shitting in"". Traditionally we used to use ""toilet"", which describes washing (as in toilet water, the correct generic term for what Americans call ""Cologne"", literally water used as part of washing); that became rude in some circles, and so the word ""lavatory"" was used, again describing a place for washing. In some polite circles, though, this has already acquired distasteful connotations and so instead we ask our hosts if we may use their ""bathroom"" -- yet another word used for a room that is used for washing. Basically, because we consider it taboo, we avoid saying anything that describes what we are actually asking for.

And, oddly enough, it's not just humans who do this. Koko the gorilla was a famous gorilla who had been taught to communicate using American Sign Language. In one very famous conversation, she got increasingly annoyed with her trainer until she snapped, and signed: ""You dirty bad toilet"".",eli5

2mm77i,Why can a car not have both a turbo and a VTEC? ,"They can, and in fact, Honda has been producing a turbo VTEC engine since 2013, and the lineup is set to expand in the future.

Now, VTEC has not tradionally been used with turbocharging because of Honda is a fairly traditional company; they like to do certain things certain ways, especially with their engines, and they tend to stick with that even while other makes do things the ""easy"" way.

One of these things was turbocharging. It became very popular in the 1990's but Honda didn't want anything to do with it, they had always produced naturally aspirated engines and wanted to continue to do so. Still, they wanted to produce engines that could compete against the new turbocharged designs their competition was designing.

In short, they needed a way to get more air into the cylinder without forcing it in under compression. The usual N/A solution to this is a more aggressive camshaft, with bigger lift and duration, to allow the valves to open sooner, stay open longer, and open wider, allowing more air. However, this comes at a cost; at low RPM, the engine runs rough, because the valves open too early, stay open too late, and the big lift reduces the air velocity, reducing swirl.

Honda's solution, VTEC, was essentially two camshafts mixed into one, with a means for the valves to switch between the profiles - the valves normally follow the less aggressive cam lobe that is good at low RPM's, but when the RPM's rise and the engine is under lload, a pin is forced by hydraulic pressure through the valve rocker arms, and lock them to a third rocker - this third rocker follows a seperate cam lobe that is designed for high-RPM use.

In this way, a VTEC engine can bring in more air, and produce more power for its size, without use a turbocharger, and while remaining smooth and easy to drive. Mission accomplished, from Honda's point of view.

However, turbo and VTEC can be combined, and this will be seen more often in the future.",eli5

Beat patterns are usually about 'strong-vs-weak', or 'call-and-respons'. For example, complex meters like 7/8 or 5/4 are usually broken up (for example, into S-w-w-w-S-w-w for 7/8, or S-w-w-S-w for 5/4).

Now, 4/4, is actually a simple *fractal* version of this feeling. It can be seen as being two sets (a strong set, followed by a weak set) of two beats (a strong beat, followed by a weak beat). This makes it nicely symmetrical, which we usually associate with stability and comfort (that's why 3/4, 5/4, and 7/8 beats often feel driving, energized, or ""off-kilter"", a little).",eli5

If you look at still water from the side, it looks like a mirror because the light rays all get reflected. This happens because the air and water have different indexes of refraction. Fiber uses the same principle, but the center has one type of glass and it is clad in glass with a different refractive index. All the light entering one end bounces off the walls until it reaches the other end. Then it comes out. We convert electrical signals to light with an LED or laser, pass it through the fiber, and convert the light back to electrical signals with a photodiode or transistor.  

Fiber is better because there is less loss, and we can combine many colors of light in one fiber to multiply the information capacity.",eli5

206hg7,"Why are some people so adamant about investing in gold? Is it a good idea? What are the risks? I do some very casual investing in the stock market. I have a small but well-diversified portfolio that has been doing well the last few years. I balance it once or twice a year and I've been happy with the results. Despite this, a relative has been constantly telling me I need to invest in gold stocks. GDX, GLD, RGL, etc. What's the big deal? What are the dangers in investing in gold? Are there political motives behind such an investment (the relative is uber conservative)? ","It's not a bad idea.  Wether it is a good idea depends on many factors.

Gold is essentially a hedge.  An investment in gold is usually designed to provide some upside in a portfolio that would otherwise be substantially affected by inflation or global recession.

Gold essentially acts as a neutral currency.  There's no government in charge of what gold ""costs"".  The rate new gold is added to the market is pretty predictable (always subject to change - if anyone ever succeeds in mining an asteroid or figuring out how to get gold out of seawater, the price of gold will crash).  The gold market is liquid, global, and transparent.  So it does reliably send price signals about the consensus of its value relative to dollars, euro, yen, swiss franc, real, peso, etc.

If you think that the future holds a lot of inflation and/or recession risk, you might want to think about adding gold to your portfolio.  It is likely to underperform the stock market (or the bond market for that matter) barring major macroeconomic effects, so in the short run it is probably going to remain flat or lose value.  

If things go utterly to hell, the price of gold won't matter a damn, of course.  So it's a hedge within a fairly well bounded range of problems, like that experienced from 2007-2009.  You don't want to live in a world where gold is worth multiples of what it is worth today; such a world would be a catastrophe.

It's hard to say if there's a ""gold bubble"".  Gold is now easier to invest in than in the past.  You no longer have to actually hold the metal or trust some entity that is relatively small to hold it for you.  The big traded gold funds are unlikely to turn out to be frauds (but the history of private precious metal dealers going rogue is frightening).  Some of the run up in gold value might be simply attributable to more people being comfortable investing in it.  But since it's been a couple of years since the peak and it seems to be holding steady, I think the chances that the current price is a ""bubble"" are receding.  

Gold could still tumble.  If the economics of the United States and Europe became much better it would likely trigger a sell off of gold.  The more confidence people have that the OECD will get its budget problems under control and deal constructively with entitlements and pension obligations, the less risk there is of sustained substantial inflation or currency devaluations.

Your uber conservative relative probably thinks those odds are low.  The relative probably thinks the economy is headed for a cliff.  There are reasons to believe your relative might not be wrong, but it's a hypothesis, not a dead certainty.

The appetite to pay for risk insurance in this form is going to vary from investor to investor.",eli5

Much later there was a revolution in Russia in which the workers, led by fans of Marx, created their own government. It was brutally authoritarian, everyone was equal - in that pretty much everyone was poor besides government members, and huge numbers of people were killed.

In china, another revolution also took place, which led to killings of intellectuals and basically anyone who didnt like the communists. Huge famines were helped by government suck.

This pattern repeats itself in any state calling itself communism (cuba, n.

I'm trying to learn more about the medical marijuana business, and this one was thing I found surprising. Why has California not legalized yet? What is the better system? ","Great question. I'm reverting to a throwaway to reply to you, due to the fact I was in the industry for a bit and don't want to carry the risk of revealing my identity. 

California, Colorado, and Washington are all very liberal states, but you ask why California seems to be lacking in the field they pioneered. Without starting a flame war it's about the Culture. It's a very big state, that has seen both the best and worst parts of the MMJ industry, because the state is so different. In Colorado and Washington they have been good about getting business behind MMJ (Big Business, however they are not there yet) California has been quite reluctant to with their laws to allow a business to get very large off a cash crop like Marijuana. Harbor side comes to mind, but they really aren't a **BIG** business. To have laws passed you need people lobbying, and campaigning for your cause. California has not done that, they don't want big corporations running the marijuana industry. This is due to quite a lot of ignorance on the subject. Every argument from monopolies to chemical in the bud have been waged against having big business come in. Then you have spots like L.A. (The sketchiest of the sketchiest) where it is very common to see unprofessional vendors being run by gangs and idiots who should have no reason running that type of venture. 

Truth is in my time dealing with the MMJ industry, is that it is very lucrative for one party. That party is the growers if they are doing professionally and apply basic business principals (So few are equipped with the ability to run a solid business) I've posted numbers of making $100,000+ per 32sqft area, doing it properly and like a businessman. Then we have the dumbasses who ruin it for us. People who have their shops closed down and raided are due to their inability to properly and legally run the shop. In all my years of seeing shops raided, I have yet to see one raided that didn't need to be. People think Harborside is raking in the dough at 10,000,000 a year in revenue, but that's nothing close to those who you don't hear about. 

Those guys whom you don't hear about are playing chess while everyone is playing checkers. They are acting as distributors, taxing their money, hiring brokers, and making off like mad men. These are the guys who are paying their fair share to make sure people think big business shouldn't be involved, because they already have an Oligopoly on multiple states (Yes, not just California)

Marijuana is a really burnt out topic for me personally. The amount of retards who are A) Involved in it, and B) Campaign for it have no idea how the business is actually operating therefore they are useless in regards to finding a solution to the problem.

Change either the speed or the distance from the sun too much and (I think) the earth just finds a new stable orbit. But what about mass? If we doubled the mass of the earth, that would increase the effects of gravity too, wouldn't it? So would the earth speed up and stay about the same distance from the sun? Would it move? If we swapped the earth and, say, Jupiter, would they be stable in each-others' orbits? Or does mass just not mater and there just are stable orbits?

I've tried googling, but I only get conflicting answers, or very technical stuff that goes right over my head. Any help would be appreciated.","Well, it depends.

If you maintain the same speed, and simply increase mass, then it wouldn't matter. As long of course, as you keep the mass much lower than that of the sun. Increase it too much, and you get a binary system.

Of course, the increased mass will also have it's effects on the other objects in the solar system (and on the moon). Increase it too much, and the moon crashes into the Earth.

It is very tiring for the brain to actually ""think"" about what it's doing, and can't be sustained for long periods of time. But what the brain can easily do is learn over time how to do stuff without thinking.

If you drive for long enough, you know how sometimes you just ""black out"" and just don't remember how you got somewhere. This is especially true when you're thinking of some big problem / planning something while driving.

yv9xn,"Why is PEMDAS in place? Why does mathematics use *P*arentheses *E*xponentials *M*ultiplication *D*ivision *A*ddition* *S*ubtraction as an order of operations when solving problems? Is it arbitrary?

I phrase this question by admitting my complete lack of understanding of math beyond Algebra II.  ","That is an interesting question. I imagine it has to do with the axioms (rules) for those operations but, to be honest, no one has ever actually explained that to me. The real numbers are a field (special set of numbers, or objects, that is coupled with two binary (on two elements) operations, addition and multiplication) so we know a few things to begin with. 

A. 1. addition is commutative a+ b = b + a

2. addition is associative, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c

3. There exists a unique number, 0, such that a + 0 = a

4. For every number, a, there exists a unique number, -a, such that a + (-a) = 0. 


B. 1. Multiplication is commutative

2. Multiplication is associative 

3. There exists a unique, non-zero number, 1, such that a*1 = a

4. For every non-zero number, a, there corresponds a unique number a^-1, such that a(a^-1) = 1


C. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, A(B + C) = AB + AC

The way the axioms are written out it seems kind of obvious that parenthesis indicate something is to be done separately of the other stuff. i.e. addition is only defined on two objects so a + b + c doesn't make sense unless we group two of them together to make one element. Therefore, we get a + b + c = (a + b) + c where a + b can be handled first to make the second addition possible. 

Exponents are just short hand for a certain type of multiplication. Now we have the question a^x + b = ? Well, it seems obvious, in this case, that a^x is acting as one number. Now, how do we interpret a^x * b? Well, that is a*a*a*....*a*b, commutativity tells us that it doesn't matter the order in which we do this so a^x can be done first as standard practice. That is arbitrary but it's also simpler.

Now, what about a^x * (b+c)? well, this is a^x * b + a^x * c and we are back at the previous case. 

Division is actually multiplication by the multiplicative inverse. i.e. division by 7 is the same as multiplication by 1/7. This follows all the same rules as multiplication, as such, it doesn't matter if you do mult or division first but standardization is for winners.

All we have left are addition and subtraction, they must be done last. Subtraction is addition of the additive inverse, as is shown in the axioms, therefore it doesn't matter which order you do this in either and standardization is for winners.

Thanks for making me think about this. 

Edit: Sorry if this isn't ELI5 enough. I thought this was in the math subreddit at first haha. I'm gonna go through and put in some stuff in parenthesis to make it easier to understand without knowledge of math. 

Edit 2: I recognize that RPN does the exact same thing. I suppose I should say, given our notation, PEMDAS is the natural way to interpret the order of operations. Note: If you change the order and keep our notation you will get different answers. For example. a * b + c with addition first would give you a * (b + c) = ab + ac or, because multiplication is commutative, b * (a + c) = ba + bc  which are not necessarily the same. As such, doing it this way would be inconsistent. Again, it's the natural way with the standard notation that is in place. I still believe that it's not arbitrary because every example, using our same notation, of a way to do it with multiplication after division has forced multiplication to be in parenthesis which then makes sure it is done before addition. i.e. you can say you're doing multiplication last but if you always write a * b+c as (a * b) + c you're forcing it to go first anyway. Also, the fact that multiplication distributes over addition tells us that multiplication follows parenthesis, at the very least, and is before addition, again, in our notation.",eli5

Why is it not until the next day, or some time after the event that leads to the pain, that the muscles start to ache?","When you work your muscles, you are causing small amounts of injury that will need to be repaired to be stronger. When an injury occurs in your body, your body releases endorphins which are natural painkillers (the source of runner's high).

In the short term, they allow you to ignore the pain coming from the injury. Why? Because the humans that immediately collapsed in pain from injuries are the ones that get caught by the large animal chasing them or the ones that can't move away from an impending landslide after getting hit with a rock. 

The natural painkiller allows us to ignore our pain so we can get ourselves out of danger first and worry about recovery second.",eli5

Currently there is no way to effectively kill a virus, because it is a really strange little beastie.

Viruses don't actually have cells that divide, **added, thanks ProtestTheHero**, it's that they aren't cells. They're a mass of proteins and DNA or RNA, and will multiply using the host body's own cells.  This means that the only effective way to wipe out a virus that has already infected a host is to wipe out the host's own cells.

Not really feasable when, in the case of a cold, the cells in question are lung tissue, and you need them to breathe.

There are two branches of medicine that do work on virus prevention or cure:

Immunisation.  This simulates the effects of a specific virus, meaning that your body's own defences grow immune, and next time you are exposed to the virus, you body can effectively fight it off.

In the case of ~~influenza~~rhinovirus (the cold), it is a rotovirus, meaning that it has subtle changes year in year out.  Also, there are many, many strains of the cold, so if you get sick one year, another strain could get you the next.

Anti-Viral Drugs:  They actually don't do anything to the virus itself, but will block the virus from entering your cells.

pqrqi,"- Why this 2012 US Election is looking more and more like 1996 I keep on reading that this year is looking more and more like 1996 by the day. I live in Canada, and at the time was only 8. ","I haven't heard this, but if I had to guess, I would say it's because there is a Democrat in the White House (Clinton in 96, Obama today) who was elected with promises of great change and has instead caused much division and disappointment in the country; being challenged by a weak Republican field without a clear message or candidate, other than ""I'm not that guy.""  The Republican challenger (Bob Dole in 96) will likely be the least offensive one, selected more because of name recognition than any ideas he might have.  Furthermore, there is a fringe candidate in the mix (Ross Perot in 96, Ron Paul in 12) bringing to light some extreme ideas that neither mainstream candidate wants to discuss.  Whether Paul or Michael Bloomberg runs as an independent candidate remains to be seen (I know Paul has said he won't, but I wouldn't be surprised), however if they do they will pull attention from the Republican candidate and likely help Obama, much like Ross Perot did for Clinton in 96.

* players that randomly decide you need to watch something other than your selection -- in mid-viewing (this resulted in a spoiler recently because I was bumped to a preview for next week while watching this week).

*  no controls to fix download rates or turn off HD

And on a related note, why don't networks adopt the shorter, more entertaining ad styles of Hulu and YouTube?  Thanks. ","Both of these answers are mainly guesses on my part.
For the white label players, the networks aren't as focused on the quality of their video players since they aren't as invested in their working correctly. Hulu and Youtube make money by having an easy video streaming service, whereas networks make money by providing and producing content to be streamed and broadcast. The streaming service companies are just more invested in how smoothly their applications work since they don't have money from ads broadcasted via cable or satelite television.
As for the commercials, I'd guess networks don't adopt Hulu-style commercials to keep their ad revenue high. Four ads get the network more money than one does.

5buidr,Why are the ₹500 and ₹1000 notes being destroyed in India? ,"The main stated reason is to target ""black"" or untaxed money.

What the government is really going after is the hard cash that circulates off the books. By making the current 500 and 1000 rupee denominations illegal tender, anybody who has large sums of money stored in these currencies will have to go to the bank with their PAN card as well as their national ID card, otherwise their money is worthless.

This lets the government record how much money is being exchanged by an individual, and also lets them look at that money with regards to their tax payments and income returns. 

If they find a discrepancy, say, a person makes 100,000 a year, but comes to exchange 300,000 worth of money with no explanation as to where that income has come from, odds are it's not legal, because no Income Tax has been paid on that. It's an extreme example, but it's just to illustrate a point.

At the same time, the government plans to roll out new denominations of 500 and 2000, ~~which are supposed to have more effective tracking technology in order to know exactly where the money is going. These new notes are supposed to have chips in them that can be found by satellites. If they find a large number of these notes accumulating in one place, it's probably being laundered or kept off the books, which would help the IRS and police raid any black money sites.~~

9c16v7,"Does primary language affect how you think compared to others at all? or how does that all work? I have no idea if this makes sense as a question, as i am a bit inebriated.","A thousand times no.

Some people tried to show that yes it did during the 1930s. This has come to be called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, based on some well-intentioned research by Edward Sapir who studied native American languages to show that they were actual fully fleshed out languages and not some gibberish as many people thought. Benjamin Whorf, his follower, then emitted the hypothesis that maybe your language influences the way you think about stuff.

There are 2 versions of the hypothesis: the strong one and the weak one.

The strong hypothesis states that language restricts what you can think about. In other words, if your language doesn’t have a way to express X easily, then you are unable to think about X. 
There is 0 valid proof for that, it is total nonsense.
Some pseudo-research that has tried to prove this hypothesis included:

- testing the ability of Chinese speakers to understand counterfactuals. Mandarin doesn’t have a conditional tense/mood/modal marker (as in, ‘if I did that, I would do that’), so obviously they can only talk about what is really happening (edit: this is sarcasm). The problem is the Mandarin used in the test was extremely awkward. 

- showing that the Hopi tribe had no concept of time, because they had no words for basic concepts like ‘tomorrow’, ‘yesterday’, etc. Well, turns out they actually do and the researchers just didn’t speak a lot of Hopi.

- showing that various tribes across the world couldn’t do basic maths because they had no words for numbers greater than X (usually 2 but it varies).
This one is a little trickier. Some tribes DO have words but they come from lexicalised compounds. In other words, if those studies had worked on English, they would have concluded that English has no word for ‘thirteen’ because it just comes from ‘three’ and ‘ten’. This is nonsensical as compounding is an active method of word formation in many languages. Other languages use metaphors for number words (like 1 is the same word as  ‘finger’ and the researcher concludes that the language has no word for ‘1’).
Some languages, like Chiquitano for instance, don’t have words for very precise numbers. They have 1, 2, a few, some, and many. Now, are we to conclude that they are unable to grasp numbers because their language lacks a precise numbering system? It seems much more logical to assume that their language lacks a precise numbering system because their culture doesn’t require it. Why would a hunting-gathering tribe care about numbers in the thousands? 

The strong hypothesis has been fully discredited. It was never real science but a way to prove the superiority of the British / Aryan / whatever race. It’s also extremely presumptuous of early ‘’’linguistics’’’ to think that language has such influence on the human mind, rather than culture affecting language. 

The weak hypothesis states that your language can influence the way you think in minor (and frankly completely uninteresting) ways, because some languages have readily available categories for stuff that other languages don’t.
For instance, Russian speakers are able to tell apart light blue and dark blue apart a fraction of a second before English speakers, because light blue and dark blue are two different lexemes (single words) in Russian. Yeah, that’s basically it.

Some other studies that may be interesting to show that your language influences your thoughts are the reports by many people that speaking foreign languages changes their personality. 
Now, what seems more probable? 
1. When you switch language, you switch personality
2. People use different languages in different situations and with different people and therefore they talk about different stuff and act in different ways. 

Now, learning a foreign language does change your thoughts, but only very indirectly. When you learn another language, you get access to another culture and thus a different point of view. But it’s not the language per se that affects your thoughts.

Diesel engines are more expensive to produce and not well suited for short-distance-driving (not efficient when not heated-up yet). As diesel and petrol are produced simultaniously from crude oil, both are available in similar quantities anyway and so the market finds an equilibrium  in using the produced diesel in heavy trucks (mostly long distance drivers) and the petrol for cars. 
In Europe, petrol is often taxed significantly higher than diesel, so there is/was an economic advantage/compensation to use diesel in cars.",eli5

1. A right-wing Republican is viewed as wanting greater de-regulation. That is, they want companies to be better able to choose what they want to do rather than the government telling them what to do. They are also typically viewed as militant. They start and continue wars with other countries.

2. A left-wing Democrat is viewed as wanting to use the government to level out the country. Taxes should be put into programs to help the poor lead a better life. They also typically support things like greater gun control.

Ron Paul supports de-regulation. He doesn't think the federal government should be allowed to tell you to do basically anything. He looks at the Bill of Rights and comes up with the concept that anything not explicitly stated in the Constitution is the state's responsibility. Republicans like this. He is vehemently against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He trashes the government who started those wars. Republicans hate this and see it as unpatriotic.

Democrats like him for many of the reasons that the Republicans hate him (stop the foreign wars). However, he wants to repeal decisions such as Roe v Wade because he doesn't see it as the federal government's responsibility.

Basically, he agrees with some of the core pieces of very opposing sides' arguments. Each group agrees with him on a very core level, and disagrees with him at the same core level",eli5

29ke1t,What makes the ejaculation of seminal fluid feel so good during orgasm and why does this sensation differ from urinating? ,"Part of it is evolutionary; to encourage you as a male to propagate the species. First, there is a lot of stimulation which occurs before, during, and after orgasm all of which are *usually* deemed pleasurable; arousal, touch, build up, and orgasm. All of these reinforce the desirability of the act of copulation (and masturbation). When you finally orgasm, your brain is flooded with chemicals such as endorphines and oxytocin. These chemicals make your brain 'high', reduce feelings of pain or discomfort, and may even promote feelings of attachment (or love, or affection, or whatever). These chemicals are extremely powerful and it makes your brain want to do the act again (usually). [See: _URL_1_ ]

Urination, however, is about normal day-to-day functions; every minute, your bladder is filling up with waste products dissolved in water. Over time, your bladder gets more full, triggering nerve endings which tell you it is about time to empty your bladder; but you can ignore it for a while depending upon circumstances. *If* your bladder is very full and *if* you release it, you *can* feel a pleasurable release which can make you dizzy or weak-kneed. This is an alleviation of discomfort, however, and not the same as 'pleasure' from orgasm. Theoretically, your brain should be desirous to avoid such discomfort in the future.

That being said, there *may* be a small portion of the male population which might feel better urinating than achieving orgasm: See _URL_0_",eli5

This happens extremely  fast, but when I looking at bright light the conversion of back to normal can't occur fast enough.

All coffee tastes the same to me (awful, even when it's loaded with sugar and milk and caramel and chocolate), and all beer tastes the same to me. All I can focus on is that one flavor that my taste buds are really sensitive to. Why is that? ","Look at it from an evolutionary point of view:

If something tastes good to an animal or human, it's because that food is nutritious (=contains a lot of energy). Sugar and fat are obvious examples.

If something tastes or smells bad, that's because it may be dangerous. Rotten food comes to mind.


Many naturally-occuring bitter-tasting compounds are actually toxic to humans, so we have evolved to dislike those. Those who liked bitter food didn't get to pass on their genes because it killed them, made them sick or infertile.

32fymn,"Why are things like Archery and Shooting considered a sport despite involving a minimal amount of movement, but playing video games professionally is not? ","""Sport"" is about more than getting your pulse over 100BPM.

The basic appearance of shooting and archery (lie/stand as still as possible) actually belies a huge amount of cardio and physical conditioning.

You have to be surprisingly fit to get through a 3-hour shoot like the Men's 3-Position Rifle event at the Olympics.

It's one of those sports where you need to be fit to excel, but doing the sport doesn't in itself make you fit!

The Pro LoL players are somewhat exceptional, and a relatively recent emergence in the world of gaming, so at the moment it's mostly tradition - they simply haven't been around long enough to be recognised by the higher end sporting bodies (and in honesty, probably haven't made an approach to those bodies. No sport is *invited* to join the Olympics - they have to lobby to get included as a demonstration sport, etc and prove their worth).

It may be that their abilities are recognised one day, if not as an Olympic type sport then on a par with Chess say, as a high-end battle of mental prowess.

The other problem with e-sports in general is their proprietary nature. League of Legends and Starcraft are proprietary games, sold for-profit.

You look at any sort of Olympic sport and it's pretty rare that you actually have to buy the rulebook. You may need equipment to participate (which for e-sports would be your computer), but you wouldn't be required to license the right to participate in the sport itself. I suspect that's somewhat of an ethical sticking point that marks the difference between a ""game"" and a ""sport"".",eli5

zcrsa,"I am seeing all of these links about Patent Trolls, and now patent wars. What is a Patent Troll and how does it really affect innovation? ","A ""patent troll"" is a person or company who buys patents, but has no intention of making anything utilizing the patents. Their goal is to charge other people or companies fees for the rights to use the patent.  
  
The patent trolls are taking advantage of a patent system which does not function well. The original purpose of the patent system was to help *spread* innovative new ideas. The inventor would document the invention, and others could use the invention themselves for a ""reasonable"" fee. Everybody wins.  
  
Of course, that assumes that patents are being awarded for useful, innovative things that haven't been created before. It also assumes that someone wanting to use the invention could afford to pay the fee.  Neither of those are necessarily true today.   
  
There is no set fee for using a patent, so it is possible for a patent troll to set the fee very high. There is also a lot of overlap and duplication between patents now, and it is almost impossible to make anything new that doesn't potentially infringe on someone else's patent. And its very difficult to tell if a patent is even valid...you could be paying the wrong patent troll, or you might end up having to pay several, unless you can afford to do an exhaustive patent search.    
  
The net result is that people/companies trying to make interesting new things can be put in the position of having to pay an exorbitant fee to someone who never plans to make anything. And if they don't, they risk the cost of a lawsuit and possibly the situation where they can't ship their product, and possibly even very high costs if they lose in court. And there's no guarantee that the patent is even unique or valid. The burden is on them to go through all previous patents to see if any others cover the invention.  
  
Who wins? Patent trolls and lawyers. Everyone else loses.",eli5

I am merely curious.)","The process by which a fetus differentiates from a single cell to an incredibly complex life-form is extremely complicated.  The thing that drives the entire thing is an intricate system of chemical signaling that tells each and every cell when to divide, where to migrate, and what type of tissue to become.  This process uses thousands of different chemicals acting in millions of different combinations.  When the mother drinks alcohol, it enters her blood stream, and is passed into the fetal blood stream.

Like wouldn't a fear response or adrenaline kick in telling them to move?","So while the traditional ""fight or flight"" response is well known, there's new research into a third F'ed response: freeze. Yep, just like a deer in the headlights, many other mammals have a third option, and it's usually the one that is employed until enough information is available to process another decision. It's akin to a hiding instinct - if you're not sure the predator sees you, probably don't want to draw attention to yourself by running into its view or attacking it. It's been a well documented reaction in other animals for a long time, but has recently been studied as a potential third reaction in the hyperarousal, or the acute stress - fight or flight - response, especially with more research into trauma psychology, as this is a very common repsonse of victims of abuse, and an answer to ""why didn't you run or fight back?""

TL;DR - it is an adrenaline response, just like fight or flight, but not a very well understood one... yet.",eli5

When you download files hosted in MEGA you download the files ""inside"" MEGA and once they're entirely downloaded they go out to the normal downloads interface of the browser for less than a second before being stored in your hard drive.

This is different to others file hosting services that download the entire file directly in the downloads interface of the browser.

How does it work and why MEGA does it this way instead of the other?","Mega does this because the file itself is encrypted. Files are encrypted before uploading and then decrypted on your system.

What is really happening is:
The encrypted file is downloaded, this takes the time.
The file is decrypted, very fast.
The decrypted file is saved, as you noticed rather quickly.

They do this to meet some legal requirements in a rather twisted way that makes it harder on copyright holders, rather than the easier the law was intended to be. A major part of this is that the encryption makes it so Mega can not identify the content without first modifying it, but they are not required to modify to identify.

1cnnnl,"Why have recent season of shows taken breaks as long as half a year?(Breaking Bad, Doctor Who, Revolution?) I don't have cable/satellite TV.  I have Netflix and other online services.  So I don't have any info directly from the channels that the shows are on.  But I have noticed that it seems like this year more shows will take a break of at least a few months before resuming.  

Is there a reason for this? Budget or time constraints? Legal issues?  Something to do with weather and shooting conditions?

I read there was a writer's strike a while back and was wondering if this was something similar.

Thank you.","I think there are a few reasons for doing this:

1.  You don't have to wait as long between seasons.  A typical show will air all their new episodes within a few months, then go into re-runs (or take a long break) before the next season airs.  By putting a break into a current season, you end up waiting twice a year (instead of once), but the breaks are shorter.

2.  It helps keep interest in the show.  By planning a break in the season, you can hopefully do more interesting things with the story.  In the case of Doctor Who (can't speak for the other shows since I haven't seen them yet), we've gotten 2 big story arcs for series 6 and series 7.

3.  Hopefully get better quality shows.  By allowing more time to shoot the shows, you give them more time to do cooler/better stuff.  Again, in the case of Doctor Who, they took breaks between filming each half of the season, and ideally they were able to use that time to see what worked and what didn't and take those lessons learned into filming of the second half.",eli5
47pf4o,Why is English considered one of the hardest languages to learn? ,"THIS ISN'T MY WORK. Sorry for any confusion.

Dearest creature in creation,
Study English pronunciation.
I will teach you in my verse
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.
I will keep you, Suzy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy.
Tear in eye, your dress will tear.
So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.

Just compare heart, beard, and heard,
Dies and diet, lord and word,
Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
(Mind the latter, how it’s written.)
Now I surely will not plague you
With such words as plaque and ague.
But be careful how you speak:
Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
Cloven, oven, how and low,
Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.

Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,
Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,
Exiles, similes, and reviles;
Scholar, vicar, and cigar,
Solar, mica, war and far;
One, anemone, Balmoral,
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
Gertrude, German, wind and mind,
Scene, Melpomene, mankind.

Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
Blood and flood are not like food,
Nor is mould like should and would.
Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
Toward, to forward, to reward.
And your pronunciation’s OK
When you correctly say croquet,
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
Friend and fiend, alive and live.

Ivy, privy, famous; clamour
And enamour rhyme with hammer.
River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,
Doll and roll and some and home.
Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
Neither does devour with clangour.
Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,
Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,
Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,
And then singer, ginger, linger,
Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,
Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.

Query does not rhyme with very,
Nor does fury sound like bury.
Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.
Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.
Though the differences seem little,
We say actual but victual.
Refer does not rhyme with deafer.
Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
Mint, pint, senate and sedate;
Dull, bull, and George ate late.
Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,
Science, conscience, scientific.

Liberty, library, heave and heaven,
Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.
We say hallowed, but allowed,
People, leopard, towed, but vowed.
Mark the differences, moreover,
Between mover, cover, clover;
Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,
Chalice, but police and lice;
Camel, constable, unstable,
Principle, disciple, label.

Petal, panel, and canal,
Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.
Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,
Senator, spectator, mayor.
Tour, but our and succour, four.
Gas, alas, and Arkansas.
Sea, idea, Korea, area,
Psalm, Maria, but malaria.
Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.
Doctrine, turpentine, marine.

Compare alien with Italian,
Dandelion and battalion.
Sally with ally, yea, ye,
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.
Say aver, but ever, fever,
Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.
Heron, granary, canary.
Crevice and device and aerie.

Face, but preface, not efface.
Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
Large, but target, gin, give, verging,
Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.
Ear, but earn and wear and tear
Do not rhyme with here but ere.
Seven is right, but so is even,
Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,
Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,
Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.

Pronunciation — think of Psyche!
Is a paling stout and spikey?
Won’t it make you lose your wits,
Writing groats and saying grits?
It’s a dark abyss or tunnel:
Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,
Islington and Isle of Wight,
Housewife, verdict and indict.

Finally, which rhymes with enough —
Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?
Hiccough has the sound of cup.

This bacteria causes blood capillaries to become inflamed and burst, in very high amounts. The swelling from the blood under the skin stops blood from moving correctly.

When blood can't flow correctly the cells in the area will rapidly die. After a while too many cells have died for the area to heal itself, a condition we call 'gangrene'. There's no saving it once that happens. So at that point we have to remove the dead limbs to stop the organisms in the dead tissue from infecting still living tissue.

The reason it doesn't happen in non-bacterial meningitis is just because the bacteria is the only thing that can actually spread the problem to other parts of the body.",eli5

Shouldn't they be aided and not suppressed or is it all just marketing and they are really just drugging you with a small dose of DXM?","The symptoms you list might be *part* of an immune response, but the real work in fighting the infection is being done at the cellular level by your immune system.  Stopping these symptoms does not stop the immune response.

If you have a cold and you stop the runny nose by taking something, the immune system hasn't shut down. It is still actively fighting the virus.  But you just aren't as miserable.

In more extreme cases, like high fevers where the fever does actively help the body, the issue is that the body can push the fever past the point of helpfulness and into a dangerous realm.  We don't know why it does this.  We do know that you can suffer long term consequences from running a very high fever for an extended period of time, so the fever gets treated alongside the illness.

Some symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea, might help flush out the issue, but again, can cause harm to the body as well (dehydration being the main one here).

9vdoqm,Why do some animals have distinct male and female members while others have ones that are nearly indistinguishable?,"Lots of reasons really, because there's a lot of different reproduction strategies. Sometimes the differences stem from how a species selects the optimal mate. For example, many bovine species (like buffalo) select a mate based on strength and aggression. The males grow extra big and muscled with a large set of horns so they can hold headbutt competitions to find out who is strongest. These males look very different from the females.

Many bird species have drab females but colourful males. The brighter the colours, the healthier and fitter the male is. After all, a sickly bird won't have bright colours and a slow bird won't survive long being so conspicuous. But the female needs to be able to hide on her nest to brood.

Sometimes it has very different reasons. For deep sea fish, finding a mate is difficult. It's pitch dark down there and the food is sparse. It's like living in a giant black void, hoping you'll one day come across a mate (I'm sorry if that resonates with anyone here). Since it's so difficult to find a mate, male anglerfish are much smaller than the females. But when a male finds a female, he'll bite her and hold on. Slowly the male will merge with the female, their blood circulatory system becomes one and the male eventually shrivels into nothing more than a pair of gonads attached to the female. Weird but it works, the female now has a permanent supply of sperm to fertilize her eggs and she doesn't have to search the endless dark for a male every year.

Other species have partner selection and reproductive strategies that require no outward distinction between males and females at all.

Anyway, the point is: there is no single reason why males and females differ.",eli5

2p4a9z,Why do satellites travel in a circular orbit when leaving towards another planet why can't they go in a straight path directly towards there destination ? ,"Orbital mechanics are tricky.  There are strange rules as to how you move from one orbit to another.  Here's a really weird one:  To make the average distance of an orbit go ""out"" from the Sun, you speed up.

Imagine a clock with a second hand.  The second hand makes one trip around the center of the clock every minute.  Close to the center of the clock the amount of distance traveled is small.  At the end of the second hand, the distance is great.  But both points take the same time to make the circuit - one minute.  The far end of the second hand is moving faster than the point close to the center.

Planets don't all take 1 year to orbit the sun, but they do move faster relative to the sun the further away from the sun they are.

Intuitively you would assume that to get from the Earth to Mars you would point your rocket at the sun and your thrust would move you away from Earth and towards Mars.  But you don't actually want to do that.

If you did that, you would be changing the shape of your orbit around the sun.  If you just blasted straight away from the sun, you would be changing that shape from a near circle (Earth's orbital shape) to an oval.  Once you stopped running the rocket motor and started to coast, your orbit would take you further out than Earth, but you would not be moving faster than the Earth relative to the sun.

Let's imagine that you designed that orbit so that when it was at the furthest point from the sun, it intersected Mars.  Seems like that would be fine - you'd end up where you wanted to be, right?

Again, somewhat counter to your intuition, you'd have a problem.  Mars is moving much faster than Earth.  When you arrived at Mars, your speed, relative to Mars, would be much slower than Mars itself.  Instead of going into orbit around Mars you would find your orbit ""kinked"" toward Mars but not enough to make a new stable orbit.  You'd do a flyby (or just crash into it if your trajectory intersected the planet).  Mars' gravity isn't strong enough to speed your ship up by enough to allow it to have the same speed, relative to the sun, as Mars.

To actually go from orbiting Earth to orbiting Mars, what you have to do is match Mars' speed relative to the sun.  So instead of blasting your rocket straight out from the sun, instead what you do is blast your rocket back along Earth's orbit.  As you speed up, you won't just move ahead of Earth in Earth's orbit.  Instead, your path will take you further and further away from the sun.  

Imagine that you're in a car driving in a circle at the fastest speed you can go without losing control.  If you speed up, you won't just follow the same circle, just faster.  Instead, you will find that you are forced to follow an ever wider circular path until your reach a new point where the forces acting on the car allow you to stop widening the circle at your new speed.

If you're speeding up relative to Earth at some point an equilibrium is achieved where the rocket's path stops moving away from the sun and becomes circular.

If you did your physics right, that point matches the distance from the sun to Mars.  If you timed it right, Mars will be in the same place in that orbit when you arrive and you'll be able to neatly enter Mars' gravity and orbit it instead of the sun because your speed and Mars' speed will be roughly the same.

Turns out, however, that trajectory is slower than it needs to be.

So we developed a ""hack"".  The ""hack"" is that instead of blasting our rocket back along Earth's orbit, we angle it somewhere between Earth's orbit and directly away the sun.  This creates an oval shaped orbit (like the first case), but it's less oval shaped than just blasting straight away from the sun.  Our rocket is moving at a speed closer to Mars' speed - but not all the way up to Mars' speed.  But we get out to Mars' orbit faster.

Mars' gravity is really strong compared to our tiny rocket.  It wasn't strong enough to capture our rocket on our first course but there is a point where it is strong enough to capture us as our speed gets closer to Mars' speed.  So we get to Mars faster, and we still orbit Mars instead of flying by it or crashing into it.  (Nothing in physics is free.  Mars actually slows down a tiny bit as a result of our doing this; there's a trade of momentum between our rocket and Mars but the effects are asymmetric because the relative size of a planet and a rocket are so great.  We speed up a tremendous amount, Mars slows down an undetectable amount.)

If you imagine that you hovered in space above the sun's pole, looking down on the solar system you could imagine what these three trajectories would look like.

The first looks like an oval, maybe with a kink at the far end if you came close to Mars.  Maybe it's not a complete orbit and it intersects the sun at its closest point or Mars at its most distant point.

The second looks like a segment of a spiral.  The ship moves away from the sun as it goes around the sun tracing a path until it reaches its equilibrium point and becomes a circle.  If Mars is at that point, it can orbit Mars or intersect it.

The third looks like the second, except the angle of the spiral is more pronounced.  At the end, if Mars is in the right place, there's a ""kink"" in the path as Mars' gravity changes the trajectory but this time we get the choice to orbit or intersect.",eli5

Edit: Any application on a mobile that lets you leave a group text conversation and thus cease to receive tests is not using actual texts, but internet messaging.

These lawsuits can be costly and numerous, costing a lot of taxpayers money. That's one thing an average person can notice (less tax money spent on useful stuff).

3e2o24,Why is gambling so frowned upon but the lottery isn't? They're essentially the same?,"I used to write software for slot machines.

First, no, they don't cheat, they can't be beaten, there are no tricks or button combinations or anything you can do to influence the outcome. They are, by definition, random. Even the bonus games were you choose a hidden prize to reveal, the amount you win is already determined before you pick. Even if it displays other values under the other picks, the prize you win was placed under which ever you picked. The choice is a farce. BY LAW. And the casino can choose the percent payout per machine, and those values are set; they don't change during play, can't be changed remotely, and requires the operator to physically open the machine to make an adjustment. And FUCK Caesars, they give the worst odds.

Anyway, these machines are addictive as hell; they're intentionally designed that way. I know market research would go out into the field and interview people who would be playing up to 4 machines AT ONCE. They're not even looking at the machine, they're just banging the Play button. One particular game we produced actually consistently exceeded the theoretical maximum number of games played a minute across installations. You can lose thousands of dollars a minute on some machines. I personally watched a grandmother on an oxygen tank feed a grand in hundred dollar bills into a machine in under 10 minutes.

I'm also familiar with lotto.

Scratch off lotteries are bad, but not that bad. And the big lotto's aren't as bad as scratch offs. People think of them differently, approach them differently. People don't spend hundreds by the minute, they buy a couple tickets, play their lucky numbers, and fairly think nothing of it. People often spend $2-4 a week.

1pjvmp,What is happening when we are being tickled? Why is smiling a common reaction to being tickled? ,"Tickling is simply stimulating the nerve endings on the second layer of the skin (the top layer is the epidermis, mid-layer is the dermis where the nerve endings reside, and bottom layer is generally called the hypodermis).

What happens that actually causes laughter is actually thought to be rather a social reaction, dominated by our psychology.

Think about it; unless simulated by another person, anything that may actually tickle you (the label of a shirt, a piece of pebble in the shoe, walking on grass barefoot, etc.) does not necessarily tickle you. Some may cause a nuisance, and at the most, you'd just get irritated or may prompt an itching response.

Sometimes the defensive reflexes kick in and promptly move the body away from the thing that causes these sensations (accompanied by goose bumps and shivers even). Imagine something like the high-held tail of a cat rubbing on your leg while it's passing between your legs while you're sitting and enjoying your sandwich watching TV. Without you expecting, the tail ""tickles"" you, but you don't laugh and rather reflexively jump away.

You can't truly tickle yourself either, because the cerebellum (at the lower-back of the brian, around the brain stem, controlling your motor actions; movement, reflex, etc. which is why it's also called the ""reptilian brain"") alerts the rest of your brain that your fingers are about to tickle you.

So why do we laugh?

With other individuals, it is a semi-expected sensation. You're expecting it, because the other person's wiggly fingers are in plain sight and they're going down on you with a sinister grin :) But you're also NOT expecting it, because it's not your hand and the cerebellum doesn't alert the rest of the brain.

So, you may be fully aware in your conscious that you're being tickled, but your brain may not be.

And here comes the laughter as a social reaction to the person in front of you. It's a form of social bonding. However, a good mood is almost like a prerequisite.

If you perceive a threat from the other person, tickling will again not stimulate laughter. You'd be too pumped with adrenaline when someone pulls a knife on you and starts forcefully tickling you (sounds stupid I know, but just imagine). Your subconscious would say more or less ""get the heck out of there before you get stabbed"" rather than ""oh, he's a friend, it's just social bonding"".

Also, think about a goat licking the sole of your feet that's covered in salt (a torture method, by the way); the depiction in movies and cartoons of the victim laughing is not true, and the reaction would more or less be extreme irritation from constant stimulation of the very sensitive nerve endings at the bottom of your feet.

Hope this answers :)

EDIT: After some Googling, apparently there is a hypothesis that explains why a good mood and the lack of a threat is important. It's called the **Darwin-Hecker hypothesis**. So, there you have it.

EDIT 2: Some formatting... I also just wrote this in a stream of consciousness, so moved around some paragraphs to more fit in with their respective topic.",eli5

This is also a byproduct of the media culture we are in, where a single aircraft crash can bring a whole assembly line to a halt, and make the government question the project altogether.

Our current numerical system, with numbers and decimals, comes from the Hindu-Arabic numerals; where digits from 0-9 signify quantities. As travelers, merchants and scholars traveled east, into the Asian empire they had to learn to use these new numeric systems. In time scholars wrote mathematical books in Arabic and a few centuries later Galileo and Fibonacci greatly appreciated this system. The Italian mathematician, Fibonacci, later wrote ""Book of Calculations"" after he learned about this in his travels in the Mediterranean world. He is credited with popularizing these numerals in the West. 

A man by the name Muhammad ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, born in about 780 C.E., wrote books about the practical use of decimals and also ""al-jabr"" or what we now know as algebra. His contribution to mathematics as result earned him a reputation as a ""great hero of Arabic mathematics"". Galileo, Fibonacci and many others held al-Khwarizmi in high esteem. 

Nevertheless, the adoption of this numerical system and then further integration of it in our societies took centuries. However it is much better than using the Roman numerals to represent numbers.

Some of them think the best way to carry your ideas out is first for the government to take control of all the tools from the capitalists, and then eventually turn it over to the people. Also, these people don't like markets because they believe it favors the rich, so there's going to be a lot more planning in this economy. People are going to get things based on need, not how much you can pay. 



This first group wins the war of ideas and the revolution begins. Unfortunately, things don't seem to be going according to plan. Because the government owns all the tools to make things, plus they control who gets what, the people are becoming oppressed. The government has complete control over their lives, and things are worse than ever for some people. No turning of power over to the people is happening. People all around the world see these self-proclaimed ""communist"" governments and societies and draw the conclusion that this is a terrible, oppressive, evil system. And so, communism has become synonymous in some people's mind for ""oppressive dictatorship"", even though by definition it is actually a stateless, classless society.",eli5

5976by,why do different countries drive on different sides of the road? Shouldn't this be universal to eliminate risk of accidents from that? ,"The why is a bit long. I'll get to that in a second, but I want to address why it's not universal.

Almost every country in the world that drives on the left is an island, and therefore doesn't have roads that interconnect with right-hand driving nations. So, there hasn't been a lot of pressure for them to change. Note that there are some countries that aren't islands, like India. But by and large, not continental countries.

Now, as to the why. The answer for both is because people are right handed. Let me explain.

For centuries, people tended to pass to the left of people they were approaching. Why? Because they were right handed, and in case the person turned out to be a threat, they wanted their weapon to be towards that threat. If he comes running at me, well, here's my sword.

As a result, traffic started to work that way too. Horse drawn carriages and wagons would pass to the left because that's what people were used to.

Then comes the agricultural revolution of the late 1700s. All of a sudden, farmers can produce a lot more food than they could before. This led to a rapid increase in the size of cities which was a key part of the industrial revolution that followed. But I digress.

More food means more food to get to market. So, necessity being the mother of invention, larger wagons were invented. While before the farmer would hook up a wagon to his horse to take food to market, now he had a much larger wagon that required multiple horses to pull.

So, he'd get a team of horses and hook them up to the wagon. So, let's say the farmer had four horses to pull it. Now, these early wagons didn't have a place for the driver to sit -- they just carried cargo. So the farmer sat where he always did -- on horseback. But there's four horses. Where does he sit?

Well, he sits on the rear left horse. Why? Rear so he can see all the horses, and left because his whip is in his right hand and can reach all the horses.

Now he's driving his food to market, and he comes across another wagon. Now, based on tradition, he should pass on the left. But there's a problem -- this is a big wagon, and it's a narrow road that was make for much narrower traffic. So the farmer passes on the *right*, because that way as he passes he can make sure that the horses and the wagon are clear of the other wagon. Can't do that if he passes on the other side.

So, passing on the right became the new standard, because of right-handed drivers on the rear left horse. This happened pretty much everywhere except places where tradition is very resistant to practicality (come on, you English people. You *know* it's true).

So, as a result, almost every place that drives on the left was once a part of the British Empire. The rest of the world drives on the right.",eli5

9lxi0l,What causes color to change on a laptop when you tilt the monitor? I've noticed that the color pink on a laptop screen can become either red or purple from tilting the monitor a certain way. What causes this and how does it work?,"Your laptop utilizes a liquid crystal display, or LCD screen.

Quick physics recap. Light is a wave. This wave can go up or down, or left or right, or any combination.

An LCD screen works by first filtering the light so that all light goes up/down. Then, the light is send through liquid crystals. These have the interesting property that they change the orientation of the wave depending on whether or not an electric current is applied. After that, there's another polarization filter.

So, to recap. There's 1 filter, then a crystal that can change the orientation, then another. By deciding whether or not you change the orientation, you can make sure that the light passes, or doesn't pass.

Now, to answer your actual question. Under certain angles, this may not work. What's happening is that you're seeing light that isn't supposed to pass through the filter, and not seeing light that is supposed to pass.

Edit: This is a much better, more detailed explanation.

3ab84f,"Why was the battle of waterloo so important? Ive always heard that the battle of waterloo was very important to European history, why is this?","Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, and basically everything you know about Europe today is because of Napoleon. He conquered the whole continent before being driven back by Russia and Britain.

Culturally, he ended the dominance of the European nobility and created one of the first real meritocracies in Europe. He essentially invented nationalism (the idea that a country belonged to it's people and vice versa) and spread revolutionary ideas across the continent. Although he didn't use the word, Napoleon's France was essentially the first Fascist state, where ideas about race instead of nobility became dominating factors and effective disciplined people were given incredible political power with no oversight.

Politically, he is the reason that Belgium and the Netherlands are separate, that Germany is unified (to protect against the next Napoleon), that Austria-Hungary didn't rule half of Europe anymore, that Italy unified into a single state, and that Spain is poor today. He inspired Adolf Hitler and created means of warfare which still shape the defensive plans of modern Russia. He crippled the Ottoman Empire and likely determined the outcome of the first world war. The great wars in Europe crippled Spain and led to the dissolution of the Spanish Empire and the independence of everything south of Texas.

If Napoleon hadn't been defeated at Waterloo, France would have likely held all of Europe as colonies where the French ruled over the 'lower cultures'.

5niw74,Why does the moon look bigger the closer it is to the horizon? ,"It's an optical illusion brought on by how we associate far away object sizes to other objects our mind is trained by. Since birth when looking at far-away unknown sized objects at the horizon our mind has been wired to assume those things to be bigger than they actually are. Here's a way to visualize what I mean: the clouds when directly overhead appear large and imposing, and spread over a large area. As they move away to our eyes they begin to appear as small, but our brain still 'stores' their actual size. and when they are at the horizon they almost appear flat and diminutive. Somewhere in our childhood this repetitive motion got smashed into our minds and now we intuitively use this as a way to 'view' sizes of objects at the horizon for which an interrupted sequence of 'inbetween' bodies are missing from us to that object.

You can apply the cloud example to other stuff like planes, birds etc. Since those are all terrestrial (Earthly) objects but the Moon is a tricky one because it's far away around 350000 KM away at most times. The brain just can't help but intuitively assume the Moon seen at the horizon to be something terrestrial and as a result 'enlarges' it inside your head. As a result, the Moon - while actually is FARTHER when it's at the horizon compared to being directly overhead, ends up looking way bigger.

A cool trick of nature indeed.",eli5

zs8kc,"Why did people want Near Field Communication (NFC) on the next iPhone, and how does it work? So, there was an old ELI5 on this topic [here](_URL_0_), but for my money, it didn't contain terribly satisfactory information. I also figured, given how unhappy some folks are that the new iPhone will not have NFC, that it will be on peoples' minds today.

Here's what I'd like to know:

1. What is NFC, and how does it differ from communication over, say, WiFi or 3G networks? (Apologies if this is an apples and oranges comparison - I really don't know)

2. What sort of equipment is needed, both on the vendor and customer sides, for it to work?

3. How are NFC transactions secured?

Thanks!","1. As the name suggests, it's *Near* Field Communication.  Meaning, the communication only takes place between two objects that are near, like phone to phone or phone to register, Etc.  This has the potential to be very useful.  For instance, you could tap your phones together and instantly sync contact information, instead of having to find the person over WiFi or enter the information manually.  You could also, potentially of coarse as this hasn't been fully implemented, pay people this way.   You can also buy stickers on which you can write information to, with which you can do a lot of nifty things, like setting switches.  Say you want your GPS app to come on when you set your phone in a specific location in your car - with NFC, you could do that, and that type of functionality would work with any number of apps or even features of the phone, like turning on/off Wifi.  There's even been a cool app for Android where you can write your Wifi and password information to an NFC sticker, and then when someone comes over to your house, if they have an Android with the app, all they have to do is tap the sticker and they're connected to your wireless - no awkward exchange of passwords.

2. I don't know much about this, but I do know that the hardware for NFC doesn't have to be very big or cumbersome.  Like I said, they have stickers that you can write to, and they really are the size of a normal sticker.  If you look closely, you can see the circuitry in them, but they aren't very big at all.  So far as I can tell, it isn't much as far as the technology is concerned - but someone else will probably have to answer this in more depth than I can.

3. The way I understand it is, you would have a pin or some other form of security that you would have to enter before every transaction, much like with a debit card.  A transaction shouldn't be able to take place if the pin is not entered, protecting against, say, someone who got their hands on a scanner and tried to secretly make transactions through unsuspecting owner's pockets (I heard this was a problem with debit cards with NFC chips, or similar technology).  Working with the Wallet app, where you would have to physically enter the pin each time, should prevent things like that from happening.

I can't give a much more complex answer than that, though.

Anyway, to me, I'm disappointed to see that Apple didn't jump on board.  I'm an Android guy, however Apple including this feature would really boost the technology's popularity since the iPhone is itself so popular, and while I don't care much about Apple, I do want to see NFC skyrocket, and without Apple jumping on board that will be more complicated, I think.  Honestly, I thought they were going to include NFC and boast about how ""groundbreaking"" and ""revolutionary"" it is, in Apple fashion, acting like other phones never had it until now...  but what we got was worse, IMO, and that's no NFC functionality.

Hopefully, Google will soon get all the bullshit surrounding it's Google Wallet app worked out, and then iPhone users can really see what they're missing out on.",eli5

2exc6r,"Why is the bordgame 'Go' not calculatable like Chess? Every strict logic boardgame can be mastered with calculation power: This means computers are able to play better chess than humans.

Why isn't that applying to Go? The game seems pretty logic for me. 


EDIT: In the comments there is also a good explanation about the more general topic about computer-bots abilities to play a given boardgame sucessful against a human.","There are a few things which I think are worth talking about here.

First is the idea of whether a game is 'solvable'. Both Go and Chess are solvable games just like Checkers or Tic-Tac-Toe/Naughts-and-Crosses are solvable. The key here is that every move each player makes is with complete information of the game which means nothing is 'hidden', there are no truly random elements, and players don't take their turns 'simultaneously'. A solvable game means that when the solution is known and each player plays as best as possible one player will always win or the game will be forced into a draw. As I said earlier, Go is a 'solvable' game in this way.

Now, the reality of it is very different. Computing the solution to a game involves a tremendous amount of computing power if the game is sufficiently complex. Chess has *not* been solved in this way and we probably need quite a lot more computing power to do so. Go is even more complicated as the number of board states is even larger. 

Compare the opening moves available to the first player in Chess vs. Go (I apologize if there are errors in specific numbers, but the scale sholud still be right). In Chess, there are only twenty possible opening moves for each player. After each player has taken just one move there are four-hundred possible game states. These numbers explode from there to have hundreds of thousands of possible combinations after just a few moves. In Go, the first player has three-hundred-sixty-one possible moves and the second player has three-hundred-sixty. After each player has taken just one move there are over one-hundred-twenty-five-thousand possible board states. People trying to solve these games will take advantage of patterns where seemingly different board states are actually the same, but the scale of the problem, particularly in the early turns of Go is much larger than for chess. By the way, this is in no way intended to compare the relative human complexity of the game, just the computational complexity.

What I think you are referring to in your question is the ability to program computers to be competent at playing a game, particularly compared to humans. Here, the relative computational simplicity of Chess compared to Go makes it easier to make Chess master computers than Go. Two of the big parts of writing a Chess AI are optimizing the opening strategy and performing look-ahead calculations. 

Optimizing the opening strategy effectively means 'solving' the first few turns of the game which are very important in Chess. While solving hundreds of moves in Chess is computationally impossible for us right now, solving opening moves, which are constrained by the inability of many pieces to move very much, is relatively easy and the pay-off for Chess is very large. Many games can be won and lost in the opening moves even if the ultimate winner plays an otherwise mediocre game. Memorizing openings is a big part of how humans get good at Chess as well. Go, with its huge number of possible opening moves is more difficult to optimize and while important, the pay-off isn't as large as in Chess. The result is that Go AIs don't get as much of a bump from optimizing the opening moves of the game.

Look-aheads are another important part of writing a board-game AI. Basically, the computer calculates future likely moves and runs them through an algorithm which gives each of those possible futures a rating and whichever has the best rating is the path the computer tries to take. Once again, the computer benefits from Chess having relatively few moves which each player can perform. Looking ahead several turns is within the capability of many computers. Go, with its huge number of possibilities requires more computing power to look ahead the same number of turns.

Finally, modern computing began as a largely western affair with European cultural obsession over Chess. A lot of effort has gone into optimizing Chess AIs compared to Go. This is beginning to even out a bit, particularly since the Deep Blue vs. Kasparov matches have made Chess a less appealing target to show off how great computers can be.

If you find this topic interesting, you might read up a bit on [Arimaa](_URL_0_), a game designed to be used with a Chess set that is relatively easy for humans to play and which intentionally makes it difficult to write AI for.",eli5

34vgwm,Why do I get exhausted when in the sun for a long time? What specifically happens within the body when you get exhausted from being in the hot sun.,"Well, two things are happening. One, your body is losing water/electrolytes to sweat (breathing with your mouth open, as you often do when it is hot, also contributes to dehydration). When the body dehydrates, it has to work harder in order to function correctly. This is especially true for the brain. 

Two, your body is overheating. You are a mammal, which means you are endothermic--you produce heat inside your body. When the temperature outside is close to or hotter than your ideal internal temperature, this causes the body to become stressed in an effort to regulate the heat. Since movement generates even more heat, it is in your body's best interest not to move around too much. Hence, the fatigue associated with heat.

1dcfuu,"Why Do Lights Hum? I'm sitting in one of our study rooms and the lights are making a humming noise, any idea why this happens?","Some lights, like fluorescent tubes, require voltages different from those in regular wall power. To transform wall power into what is required for the bulbs something imaginatively called a ""transformer"" is used.

A transformer uses the fact that an electric current through a wire produces a magnetic field, and a magnetic field produces a current in a wire (induction). This is how electricity is made in a generator, by cranking magnets around near coils of wire. In a transformer one coil can be made to induce a current in another, but with differing numbers of coils the voltage can be changed. So we could increase the voltage for our bulbs with just two coils of wire wrapped around some chunks of iron.

Now if you recall the magnetic field used to transfer this current can be quite strong. Also it isn't steady, it switches back and forth (AC = alternating current). This switching creates physical stresses in the structure of the transformer, it is like a big magnetic hand trying to bend the coils this way and that. While the structure is strong enough to withstand such forces, it is bound to flex somewhat. That means quick, short vibrations which can often cause audible humming.",eli5

1uzzk3,Why are so many Vietnam veterans homeless? ,"I pulled this from _URL_0_

It seems to be a pretty good broad overview. Hopefully someone more personally knowledgeable will check in and elaborate.


**Why are there so many homeless veterans?** Veterans returning from combat duty with PTSD, disabling physical injuries, and few if any marketable or transferrable skills, often can’t find or keep jobs. With no salary to support them, military families face a foreclosure rate four times the national average. Lack of support services and social isolation after discharge also contribute to homelessness.

It’s a vicious cycle.  Joblessness leads to homelessness, which leads to hopelessness, substance abuse and/or depression, which limit the veteran’s ability to find a new job. The statistics are daunting:

Approximately 1 of every 3 homeless males in the U.S. is a veteran.

Veterans are twice as likely as other Americans to become chronically homeless.

More than half a million veterans are homeless at some time during the year.

Homelessness affects veterans of all wars. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the number of homeless Vietnam-era veterans is higher than the number of people who died during that war. A recent survey by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans found that nearly one in four homeless veterans has recently returned from combat in Afghanistan or Iraq.",eli5

1hhkqt,Why did the concept of marriage become so popular? ,"Because it creates bonds.

Imagine you're a farmer.  You grow grain.  All the other farmers around you grow grain.  Everyone has to take their grain to the mill to get it processed into flour.  This is a big expense.  The miller doesn't grow anything, he makes his living by charging others for his service.  Everyone is on pretty much equal footing.

Now, imagine the miller has a daughter and you have a son.  You manage to arrange a marriage.  Now, the miller's grandkids live with you.  You're family.  If you and your son do badly, his daughter is poor.  So he cuts you a break, and you now have an advantage over all the other farmers.

There are all sorts of risks involved with the procedures (which are often performed without anaesthetic), and not even a single *potential* health benefit in the way that male circumcision may have.

I'm not at all a fan of routine male circumcision, but it's clear that FGM is simply in a different league.

","Your eyes are constantly producing ""tears"" which both keep the eye hydrated as well as flush contaminants towards your tear ducts to be carried away.  When you sleep, you don't blink and your eye movements are significantly reduced.  Without these mechanical mechanisms, this fluid doesn't cycle through as quickly and can begin to dry out and thicken.

When you wake, there can literally be a film over your eyes that takes some time to clear away.  This blurring effect can also be exaggerated if you have a sty (similar to a small zit on the inside of your eyelid).

What not just roll with it? ","People who invest a lot of energy in conspiracy theories are generally looking for significant reasons to explain significant happenings. They can't believe coincidence, luck, or happenstance play a role in world events. They seek to find grand patterns in things that explain what's going on.

This is usually because they are desperate for certainty in an uncertain world. If the Bilderberg Group is secretly causing everything that's going on, it means the real operator isn't just chaos. Many people are afraid of a world in which things happen for countless little reasons rather than one big reason.

The inverse of the phenomenon is blaming immigrants or different minority groups for the troubles in the world. The same people often hold both of these ideas at once. They seek to put a human face on things, so they have an identifiable enemy. You can't blame greed and stupidity for anything. But you can blame a shadowy syndicate of evil masterminds for whatever bothers you.

Are they right? Could these conspiracies be happening? Probably not. It would take tens of thousands of totally effective conspirators to pull off a global coup of the type usually proposed. In reality, human nature dictates that maybe one in five people would screw it up so badly the whole thing would be exposed within a week.

139wiz,"why Linux is so special among Unix flavors (Unices?) Unix was around long before Linus Torvalds came along, right? And there were all sorts of different competing varieties. Then Linux was introduced, and now it's taken over the roles that would have been filled, and the competition's between different kinds of Linux. So what makes Linux so special that it's considered separate from Unix, and why is it so popular?",">  So what makes Linux so special that it's considered separate from Unix

Well, first of all Linux is *not* Unix. Unix has a specific meaning, going back to the original product and progressing down through all the licensing to its modern day forms. Linux is instead Unix-*like*, it's designed to be compatible with Unix in many ways. A contrasting example would be Apple's OSX, which really is Unix-*based*. The similar system structures mean that a lot of stuff works in similar ways and many programs are very easily compatible with both types, but linux is entirely written from scratch and does not include any original Unix code. That's actually an important legal point that's been contested in the past.

What this really means is that Linux is independent of Unix's licensing. Not only this, but it is a big flagship example of the free software and open source licensing community. Right from the beginning, it's been developed as a community effort with contributions from all over the place, leading to its modern position supporting an amazing number of different systems with an amazing amount of flexibility both in theory and in practice. Actually, this part turns out to work extremely well, the linux kernel and all its associated tools for the tasks it dominates are considered extremely high quality and are popular for this reason.

 >  and why is it so popular?

It's become popular because a mixture of the above properties turn out to work really well for many different people. Its massive flexibility and free availability make it the obvious choice for many different tasks. For instance, if you want a simple OS to run your DVD player or TV recorder, you don't want to have to build your own from scratch or to buy one, it's simply not important enough...but thanks to linux you don't have to. Or a more modern example...if you want to build a phone OS to compete with iOS and don't want to build it from scratch, the linux kernel is already there with all those features you need baked right in.

It's also popular for more standard computer tasks such as servers or supercomputers. This is mostly because it's really well designed and supplied for the job, partly because it's so popular and its open nature feeds this popularity back into further development. This kind of relatively technical application also avoids the areas where it's traditionally fallen down, such as user friendliness (not to say that it still does so...progress recently has been very good).

 >  and now it's taken over the roles that would have been filled, and the competition's between different kinds of Linux.

I don't know how true this is exactly, but in general this is again for the reasons above. It's popular, flexible and open, so there's both the drive and the technical ability to make it run on practically any hardware. Not only this, but it means then all your hardware can have the same base and be developed in the same way.",eli5

The thing is that seizures are caused by the majority of brain cells firing all at once over and over again, drowning out any information that they are supposed to compute. In regular people, the brain chemistry stops that from happening, but it happens more easily in people with epilepsy.

When you watch something flashing over and over again, it causes your vision brain cells to fire in sync, but this shouldn't spread to the *entire* brain.

To put it simply, you don't have the mechanisms that allow you to store and recall memories until you're around 3 1/2 years. Until that, you have what's called childhood amnesia. From that moment on, when you're 7-10 years old, you go through a period that's called reminiscence bump, when the majority of your childhood memories begin to form and stay with you all your life.

However, in extreme cases (e.g, birth of a brother, death of a grandparent) it has been proved that children under three years old can create and store that kind of autobiographic memory.

1kouuq,"Why are TV Networks channels different numbers by region? Like NBC in Chicago is 5 and in NYC it is 4. 

I just feel like it would be much easier to have the same channel in each region. ","NBC is not a channel, it is a network of channels (stations).

Chicago does not have an ""NBC Channel"", it has WQAM-TV, which is a station that is an affiliate of the NBC network.

Similarly, there is no ""NBC Channel"" in Philadelphia; there is WCAU-TV,  another station that is an affiliate of the NBC network.

Historically, these stations were all separately owned and operated. Most of them still are, although some of the larger ones are now in fact owned by the network. Many of the stations began their lives without any network affiliation, they were licensed and assigned a channel without any regard to other stations in other parts of the country.

What makes these stations ""NBC"" is that they have entered into a contractual agreement with the NBC network to carry a certain amount of programming produced by NBC.

This is, by the way, why outside of prime time the various local stations will be airing different programs even if they are on the same network. E.g. The NBC station in New York and the NBC station in Boston will air the same thing at 8pm, but different things at 3pm.

Trying to assign all affiliates of the same network the same channel number wouldn't even make sense, because a station can decide to change its affiliation, and even in some cases be affiliated with two networks at once.

c140hn,Why does the body have panic attacks and anxiety when it's completely productive (I.e. paralyses the person in the face of a challenge)? ,"Think of a cat freaking out when it sees a cucumber. 

It's an automatic flight or flight response that gets triggered by things your brain thinks is a threat - but isn't. 

The heart beats faster, pumping adrenaline around the body, making you feel anxious and want to run away or fight. Or turn to ways of dealing with it, like alcohol (which makes anxiety worse in the long run, leading to a vicious cycle).

This automatic response is part of the 'animal' part of your brain, which also deals with hunger, anger, loneliness, tiredness. It reacts quicker than the 'logic' part of your brain - the part that makes you, you. A technique to reduce anxiety is to do a quick scan of whether you're hungry, angry, lonely or tired... or scared by cucumber. This puts the 'logic' part of your brain - you - back in the driving seat. Learning to control anxiety in this way is a skill that can be learnt, like any other skill. 

Anti anxiety medication (like propranolol) works by stopping adrenaline from moving around your bloodstream as quickly. The cat has time to realise that the cucumber is just a cucumber.

With this, came the removal of predation and competition for mammals causing them to multiply rapidly. What I never understood, is how did the dinosaurs all get wiped out but mammals did not? Did they not experience the same after effects?","When the asteroid hit, it likely started wildfires all over the world due to secondary impacts, which not only wiped out most of the terrestrial food reserves but also made the air fairly toxic and blocked out a good amount of sunlight causing the non-radioactive equivalent of a nuclear winter. 

If any large mammals existed at the time, they went extinct and we just never found their fossils. 

Small mammals, though, mostly living underground to hide from predators, weren't necessarily killed immediately, and as small mammals usually grow up fast, the mildly toxic air didn't kill them before they could breed.

More importantly, they didn't need much food, so what little food remained was enough to last them - or probably just a small fraction of them - until the dust settled and the vegetation started regrowing.  

One correction to your understanding: the dinosaurs didn't die out. The big ones did, but the small ones thrived to nearly the same extent as mammals. At least the ones that were able to fly.

Women at generally 5 inches while men are 100 inches. If the women were to shrink down just one inch that would be 220 below the norm.

3v9kuf,Why does radiation exposure cause birth defects and mutations? What exactly is happening biologically? ,"In order to be precise, we want to talk about *ionizing radiation* not to confuse you or make you think that any electromagnetic radiation would do that.  

In your cells and obviously the ones that your developing child has, the chromosomes hold your DNA, which again is just a huge string with certain sequences called genes on it.  
These genes are basically cooking-recipies for any protein or active agent, that does something functional in your body.  
Physically they are just pairs of 4 different types of bases.  

Ionizing radiation is capable of damaging such a base, which obviously damages the information stored in the gene.  
Well, depending on the dose of radiation you are exposed to, these damages get heavier or just more.  
Depending on how heavy these damages are, the body has proteins, which can repair such defects again, but at a certain level, the damage is irreparable.  

In the worst case, certain genes will express non functional proteins, which will trigger a cascade of thing, leading to all sorts of disfunctions.  

At least that is my understanding.  
Please correct me, if i am mistaken at some point.",eli5

Alcohol makes it more difficult for the cerebellum to do its job. Just as it becomes more difficult to walk gracefully, it also becomes more difficult for your eyes to work as a team. 

But when there's only one eye to control? That requires less elaborate coordination and so you might not have issues until you're nearly blackout drunk.

2r8w1w,"When you install a piece of software, why are you told to restart your computer even though it runs fine without restarting it? ","This is a big oversimplification, but here we go.

If a file is in use by the filesystem, what the software has control of is a file handle: it's an address to where the file is located on disc. When you update something or overwrite a file, the operating system creates a new file, and references the filename to the new file's file handle.

The old file, however, is still marked as in use. It's still there on disc, and _that_'s the file being accessed by currently running software. To fix this, software updaters or installers will often have you _close only the software_ that's being used. Think about updating any random piece of software: you have to close it to update it more often than not, right?

Recall that, since the program itself is a file (e.g. an .exe file), when you update software, you expect to have the new version of the software running, and not the old one. The only way to ensure that all the new files are being used is to close that software and reopen it. When you do this, you get the new version of the software running.

Now, extend that idea to files that the _operating system_ needs. The only way to ensure the operating system is truly up to date is to close it and reopen it. This is a computer restart.

So, tl;dr: it's not _actually_ updated until you restart, you just have the new files.",eli5

3wc41b,why is the normal work week Monday through Friday? ,"The realization of the 40-hour workweek that has become standard across many American industries was hard fought. It took deadly accidents, employees banding together and a White House willing to listen to make it happen.

“It’s not just one incident, but it was a culmination of many events and many struggles that allowed this to become law,” said Angelica Santomauro, executive director of the American Labor Museum in Haledon, New Jersey.

Eight-hour days became rallying cries in the latter half of the 19th century, as workers in the building trades and similar industries marched together for better conditions. The Ford Motor Company advanced the idea in 1914, when it scaled back from a 48-hour to a 40-hour workweek after founder Henry Ford believed that too many hours were bad for workers’ productivity.

The formation of unions helped to strengthen the idea of working five days a week as well. In 1937, auto plant workers staged a sit-down strike in Flint, Michigan, to protest bleak conditions at General Motors that included no bathroom breaks, no benefits or sick pay and no safety standards.

The negotiations between GM and the United Auto Workers ultimately improved working conditions. The federal government would show its support when Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, a key part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. 

[Source](_URL_0_) 

TL/DR
Basically, the Unions said they were gonna strike if the laws were not changed. Roosevelt knew that if the people went on strike then the country would be in a complete mess financially. You have to remember though that the unions were needed back then. The working conditions were an absolute nightmare. Yes, there was a couple 'good' companies that paid well; such as Ford Motor Company at the rate of $5 a day,but they worked 12 hour days 6 or 7 days a week. Also, to note that Henry Ford would walk through the factory and if he caught an employee talking they would get fired on the spot.",eli5

6e29id,how come people can't get sober on their own? ,"They can. Or at least, some people can.

Addiction is a hell of a thing. It changes neural pathways in your brain, it changes the way you think, it changes the way you feel. A person who is truly addicted will do just about anything to get their fix of whatever it is they're addicted to.

This means that when they try to get sober, they have their own brain working against them. It's sort of like trying to stop breathing--you can do it for a little while, but eventually your subconscious kicks in and forces you to take a breath. When you're trying to get sober, eventually your subconscious will kick in and you'll find yourself right back to using again. A lot of times a person who wants to quit can't find a way to get out of the situations that make them use in the first place. For example, a good friend of mine has been trying to quit using heroin for a long time, but she can't afford to move away from her roommates, who all use heroin. She doesn't want to get rid of all of her friends, who all use heroin. She can't really change the route she takes to get to work because she takes the bus, and her dealer rides the bus. So she's constantly surrounded by people either using or selling the drug she's trying to quit. It's very hard for her. 

Some people are able to overcome their addictions themselves, of course. I dropped heroin cold turkey after several years of abuse. I recently quit drinking alcohol cold turkey after over a decade of abuse. This isn't a terribly uncommon story, either. Lots of people do it that way. It's just that some people have a much more difficult time than others, and it isn't because they're weak-willed or incompetent, it's just that addiction is a very powerful condition.

""The Doctor"" is a traveller through time and space, who goes on grand adventures and through great dangers. With him, almost always, is a companion (or sometimes more than one).  
The show started as an educational concept, but quickly went more towards aliens and drama. The Doctor, being an alien himself, has the ability to regenerate a new body when he is mortally wounded--thus, there have been twelve different actors playing The Doctor to date.

If you enjoy science fiction, you should absolutely be watching it RIGHT NOW! If you're not a big SF fan, you probably still should watch it because it is some of the best-written TV of all time.

I would recommend starting with the 'reboot', which began with Christopher Eccleston in 2005. He did a brilliant job of bridging the gap between the old shows (heavy on the cheesiness, partly due to the lack of special effects budget) and contemporary dramatic pacing.

It's been a while since I took American history, but I do remember huge anti-trust actions being taken against a multitude of companies and organizations. Why are these no longer a thing? Is it simply that it's an outdated concept with no place in the modern world or is it a matter of lobbying from companies that prevents this?

Edit: So it seems as if I was a little naive in my way of thinking. Thank you so much for answering my question. ","They are actually enforced more than they *ever* have been.  Its just a much more complex and ""known"" situation now, that its very very uninteresting to report on for the media, so unless you're very inovolved in how this stuff works in specific industries of business, you'll probably never hear about all of the stuff going on.

Pretty much everyone in business, economics, and the govt agencies simply know how all of this stuff can work, and will work, and there isn't too many unknowns out there any more, which makes it so that all of these mergers and stuff, you simply don't do it unless its legitimate, because thats bad business to have stuff denied.  

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who is the main US agency who deals with this type of stuff, is also considered to be crazy good at their job, and the world's gold standard-- basically, they know their shit, everyone knows they know their shit,  so they make things very reasonable, enforceable, and known.  In other words, no one is trying to do weird stuff, because their know the FTC isn't having any of that.",eli5

21tve2,"Why does my professor make me buy the new textbook? Some classes force me to buy the newest edition of the textbook despite it being nearly the same as the previous edition. I understand the textbook company makes millions off this awful system but what does my professor get out of requiring the expensive new version of the same old book?

EDIT: I should have specified this occurs even in courses where the professor was not involved in writing the book.","Oftentimes it's not the professor that's being the bastard, but rather the publisher. The professor decides [whatever book], 3rd edition is required for the class and informs the bookstore. The bookstore will contact [whatever book]'s publisher and put in an order for the 3rd edition. Publisher responds with, ""Great news! That book is now in it's 4th edition! So that's what we're going to send you."" 

So the bookstore informs the professor they have the 4th edition, he updates his syllabus accordingly, and the bookstore puts that on the official listing of required texts. Professors probably don't appreciate forcing students to spend a ton of money, the bookstore makes money but they have to deal with everyone's bitching, and meanwhile, people forget that the publisher decided it was critical to re-format the table of contents and add an extra couple pages on some obscure topic that no professor even bothers to teach so they can kill the used book market and make another $150+ per book.

lzv2p,"Why do people blame the president for not creating jobs? I thought the whole concept of United States economics was laissez faire, that government was to stay out of the economy as much as possible.","The whole concept of being a good neighbor is to stay out of your neighbor's house, but if it catches fire, you bust the door down and start rescuing people.

There is no one single overriding economic philosophy in the United States. It's a nuanced thing. For the most part, the economy steers itself, but when necessary and appropriate, the government nudges the tiller.

As for why people blame the *president* specifically, well, that's pretty much his job. The president of the United States is the head of state, which means he gets the credit when things go well, and he gets the blame when things go poorly. This is not entirely unfounded; the president is the leader of his political coalition, and as such has significant influence in the Congress. He does not have the power to *introduce* legislation, but he can *strongly encourage* legislation be introduced by the leaders of his coalition in the Congress. Beyond that, the president is the head of the executive branch, where all of the actual low-level day-to-day decision-making of government happens. Consequently, the president has broad powers to set policy in many areas. This is countered, however, by the fact that he does not have *total* power to set policy; many agencies of the executive branch are specifically set up to be independent, to keep them from being puppets of a president who knows more about politics than he might about, say, macroeconomics or public health or how to fight a war.

So the president gets the credit and the blame. Whenever things go well and the president gets credit for it, it's always going to be a bit more than he personally deserves. Whenever things go poorly and he gets blamed, he's always going to take responsibility for a bit more than he technically ought to have to. Because that's the job.",eli5

It's like having a leaky faucet filling a jug as usual and then you decided to ever so gradually start turning the faucet on more and more.  Eventually the jug is full... You have to pee.

If you continue drinking at this point the rate of urine production will stay high while your body works to remove the alcohol you just consumes. But even if you right then decided to stop drinking for the night that faucet doesn't just close back down to the original trickle rate but instead takes time to gradually close.  Until the alcohol is filtered out by your liver your body will otherwise continue working to produce more urine, often using extra bodily fluids to do this until you're dehydrated (a hangover).

63bni1,"Why is there such a push for automated cars in the US, instead of just improving public transportation? There are a lot of parts of the country where passenger trains are not available, or or limited availability.","To answer the comments section part of your question ask if you really know how much these trains cost vs how much people use them. Modern heavy transport is incredibly expensive to build as infrastructure, and only really suits the heaviest traveling routes. Inside a city, sure. City to city town to town, you owe a lot of what already exists to much older rail lines before cars were so easily accessible and highways so bountiful, before airplanes roamed the skies. 

But then a train doesn't really finish the problem does it? I take a train to small city 1, how do I get around? Subways are out of the question usually due to cost, busses are your best bet, but they have limited range and gaps. What about winter when you're carrying home kids and a mile from the nearest bus stop carrying groceries. 

Lastly who pays? You buy or lease your own car, most of the world gas taxes take care of the road, but an exceptionally good network of busses or whatever would be extremely expensive. So you think you can force everyone to cough up over 1-3k a year to pay into it? For example an annual pass in Toronto is around $1500 last time I checked, it's nowhere close to really covering the whole city without a lot of people having 2+ hour commutes, and the govt pretty openly says without heavy govt assistance that doesn't really pay what it costs to move you.

1xo9pt,"Why is it bad for the U.S. government to have zero debt? I remember my history teacher explained this to me, but I forgot what he said. Why would we need to have at least some debt?","It's not necessarily *bad*, it's just that there are economic benefits and drawbacks on both sides.

Remember, every economic transaction has two parties--the buyer and seller. We generally think of debt as ""bad,"" but it isn't for the bank--that's how they make money. (And pay their employees, lest you think this is just for the fat cats.) And it's really not bad for the borrower, either--debt is (generally) used for useful purposes. If we saved up enough money to buy a house, we'd all be 50 years old before we could move in to our own property. (That's why credit card debt is often seen as ""bad""--it's usually not spent on ""useful"" things--and yet mortgages are ""good"".) Remember, in a free market all transactions are voluntary, so both sides feel like they're getting a good deal or else they wouldn't make the trade.

Anyway, that's the same thing for the government--the government has sold its debt to the public in the form of bonds. Those bonds are useful for investors because they are a ""safe"" security to hold. If the government was no longer in debt, then those bonds would effectively not exist. The next safest thing may not be so safe. (There are other reasons; this is just one).

Now, there are plenty of opinions on both sides (many people consider government debt ""bad"" because it wastes it on political garbage and not on something useful--your political ideology will probably determine how you feel about that), so the debt represents a large amount of wasted opportunity that still needs to be paid.",eli5
mh219,"Why are much-wanted TV shows like Firefly and Arrested Development (well, previously) so hard to get back on the air despite a rabid fan base? I'm just curious.  Seems like there's a good majority of folks online who would watch *Firefly* and for a while people yearned for *Arrested Development* to get back on the air; however there always seems to be an obstacle standing in the way. 

Is it a skewed opinion of the actual amount of viewership?   Are networks not interested and / or don't think it won't garner ratings despite acclaim? 

","OK, Like you are 5:
1) TV shows are expensive to make; for example an ""inexpensive"" show such as a reality show on TLC runs about $700,000 per episode. A drama such as Firefly (with special effects) or AD (with dedicated sets, larger crew, etc) costs much more.

2) Additionally, each 1/2 time slot has a ""cost"", based on how much money a network thinks it can/should make in that 1/2 hour.

3) The ""good majority of folks online"" could very well be a false sample, and in fact the ""rabid fanbase"" may not provide the amount of viewers necessary to cover (1) and (2) compared to other shows that can. You are online all the time, so it seems like a large viewership to you.

2. As far as I aware, some commercial structure can pay for goods without VAT or get refund for VAT. Why?","At least for 1:

The idea of a VAT is that each firm that touches a product pays for the value they add to the product (so a farmer pays tax based on the value of his grain, the baker pays tax based on the difference between the wholesale price of bread, and what he paid for grain, the grocer pays tax based on the difference in the retail and wholesale price of bread).  

Rather than simply putting a sales or excise tax on bread, a VAT greatly reduces enforcement cost, because one side of each transaction wants to report the taxes paid by the other, because that's a deduction for them (remember the baker gets to reduce their taxes by the amount they paid for grain and the grocer reduces his taxes by the amount he paid for bread).",eli5

2zd94g,"In a day and age of ~7 billion people, more jobs, and more money than can be assumed in much of recorded history, why is it that everyone I talk who has a job to seems to be ""overworked and underpaid,"" even with the recent raising of employment rates? ","Real wages have been falling for decades. Workers know that the same amount of work yields less reward than it used to. The cause for this are many but in general it has to do with moving more investment out of the world of work and into the world of financial speculation. People used to invest money in companies and expected a nice rate of return over years. The company did well in part because it paid workers well for work done. Starting in the 80's more and more stock holders and financial management companies started to demand higher returns and faster return on investment. This meant companies had to do more with less. Fewer workers and lower pay in order to meet the expectations. Outsourcing and moving production out of the US was also done to meet these ends. Further companies stopped pension plans and made other changes to benefits plans to reduce costs to increase profits. And of course they were in a race with other companies doing the same so it was also to stay in business when other companies were cutting even further by getting rid of unions and hiring less skilled/experienced workers. 

We now find ourselves with longer work weeks and more days worked per year than any othr industrialized nation. We have all time high cash reserves in corporate strongboxes. But they are not adding more workers in general because now built into the system are expectations and agreements for pay packages for CEOs that they produce profit levels and returns on investment which can only be met by burning workers.

It does not have to be this way. People like to do good work. People like going to work at a place where sometimes they are running full tilt but at other times they can lay back a bit. But the top level of major companies are taking so much out of the company there is nothing left to hire new help with out affecting their performance numbers. 

In the end these practices are destroying the middle class.The way the US economy works is based on consumerism. the middle class does not have enough money to fuel the economy in a good growth curve any more. More and more now spend most of their money on essentials.  You have to have more employees and pay current employees more to fuel the growth of the economy.

vqwkw,"-- Why is it that I can wake up more tired than I was when I went to sleep? I'll often go to sleep even when I'm not tired at all, simply because I need to get my X hours of sleep a night. When I wake up, I nearly always feel more tired than when I went to sleep. Intuitively I would think that our bodies are like a battery that is charging overnight, but that's obviously wrong given this. What's the deal?","Your brain goes through something called a ""sleep cycle."" Basically, there are different kinds of sleep - deep sleep, dreaming sleep, etc. Your brain goes through them in a certain order. And it goes through the overall cycle of these different kinds of sleep twice per night.

When you go to bed when you're not tired, your brain takes a lot longer to get into the cycle. And when you wake up without having gone through a normal sleep cycle, the sleep isn't nearly as restorative as it should be.

Ultimately, what your brain needs is consistency. Not just X hours every night, but X hours starting at the same time every night. That way your sleep cycle is consistent and your brain can consistently get the amounts of each kind of sleep it needs to function optimally during the day.

Also, if your sleeping environment is noisy or inconsistently lit, that can disrupt your brain's ability to sleep also. I personally sleep best in deep darkness and absolute quiet, but there are many people who sleep very soundly with a night-light and a fan running. The point is, the light level should be consistent (no flashes, no lights turning on and off) and the sound level should be both minimal and steady.",eli5

","Its the blood sugar cycle. When you eat lots of high carb food your blood sugar spikes which causes an insulin spike to lower your blood sugar. When your blood sugar is low you feel hungry again.

To counteract this eat more protein which will even out the blood sugar spike. Eat whole grain carbs because the fiber slows down carb absorption which will even out the spike. Eat foods higher in fat and lower in carbs to even out the spikes.

You can actually use this as an advantage in dieting. Eat less high carb foods like pasta, rice, potatoes, corn, breads, pastries, and anything high in sugar and more foods higher in protein and fat and as you adjust to this you'll become hungry less often without the blood sugar/insulin spikes.

3dscne,"When you're looking for something you've lost, why can't you see it when it's somewhere you've looked repeatedly? ","We don't really ""see"" things that we look at.  We scan, and imagine all the missing details.  We also need to be paying attention to those details (to some extent) AND to have a good idea of what we're actually looking for. Finally we often impose our ideas on reality.

First of all, we usually fail on the scanning side, because we're in a hurry, sweeping our eyes over things quickly, etc.

Secondly, we're often not paying that much attention to the actual search: instead, we're obsessing about having lost the item, about being late, imagining where ELSE it could be when it's NOT here, etc.  So imposing the idea that it's not here, when it might be. That feeds our imagination, which fills in the details in the room, and literally tells the imagination/visual system, ""no, I'm not really expecting keys, so it must be something else you're looking at.""  And just like things morph in our dreams, or morph from clouds to dogs in the recently published Google AI research, we change the scene, so we see something else instead of keys.

Thirdly, we often don't remember what the item looked like when we last touched it.  So maybe it's lying upside down, or jumbled up with something else, or half-hidden under something.  And so even if we see it, we don't recognise it's ""pattern"".

Basically, we just suck at searching for things in jumbled places like homes.  Nuts at the base of their usual tree type, in their usual forest type, tend to look pretty similar, compared to all the configurations of a keyring under coats or on worktops in a modern home, I suppose.

And then we have all the modern pressure of expectation to have our keys at every moment, compared to the simple expectation that nuts are sometimes hard to find, but if you keep looking, you'll find it eventually.",eli5

18irh1,"Why do old film movies take a second to ""snap"" into clarity after a scene change? I'm assuming it has something to do with the transfer from film to digital?  But maybe not?","It is actually the reel change.

A feature length film will not fit onto one 'can' or reel of film, several reels are required, each one being somewhere between 14 and 20 minutes.

When the reel is about to finish, a cue mark is flashed on film.  Usually a dot in the top right corner and usually for 4 frames.  This would alert the projectionist that the reel needs to be changed

In modern movie theatres, the film rolls are loaded up in a magazine, and the next roll of film automatically starts.

With digital projections, there is no film, the whole film can be fitted on one piece of media, so there is no change over.

In older theatres - and some that have not updated their equipment - they used a two projector system.  The next roll of film would be cued up in the second projector, at a set time - generally around 8 seconds - the second projector starts up, and when the cue mark is seen, the projectionist switches to the second projector.

The next roll of film is then loaded into the first projector, and the process is ready to start again.

These are the facts I know, the reason there are a few frames out of focus, I'm just going to guess.

a) Although the second projector should be focused, if this is the first change, it may be slightly out of focus.  The projectionist would then hastily focus the picture.

b) The first few frames on a roll of film would not pass through the film loading mechanism absolutely flush, so the picture is slightly out of focus.

c) Although the two projectors are side by side, the image is from a slightly different angle when changing projectors.  This would momentarily break the illusion of a moving picture as your eye catches up with the change.",eli5

o0nve,Why and how do GPS satellites compensate for the effects of relativity? ,"So, GPS satellites know their own location at all times, and they act as landmarks for GPS receivers.

A GPS receiver figures out its distance from each landmark by measuring how long it took for the radio signal to travel from satellite to receiver. To make this possible, each satellite has to broadcast the current time, and this time signal has to be extremely accurate.

GPS satellites need to correct for relativity because time is relative. Satellites are moving relative to the Earth's surface, and they experience less of Earth's gravity due to their altitude. This causes satellite time and Earth time to drift apart. This drift is very small and very slow, but GPS needs very precise timekeeping in order to work well.

That's the why. The how is simple: the clocks on the GPS satellites are designed to run slowly, such that each second takes a bit too long. Once the satellite is in orbit, however, relativity makes the clock appear to run faster (from the point of view of someone on the Earth's surface), and it appears that the clock keeps perfect time.

6t59gc,"If an obese man lost a lot of weight and got in really good shape, if he had kids after getting in shape, would the kids be healthier than if he had the kids when he was obese? Why or why not?","Look up something called Epigenetics. Epigenetics are the things that determine how your DNA is expressed. Epigenetics definitely changes on a generation by generation basis. We don't know a tremendous amount about it, but what studies we have done pretty strongly show that epigenetics can do things that normal DNA cannot. Such as making an offspring have an aversion to certain smells and chemicals based on what the parent experienced.

Here are two great videos on it:
One from [MinuteEarth(2:43)](_URL_1_)

And one from [Scishow(9:28)](_URL_0_)

A great takeaway is that the changes in epigenetics were passed onto sperm cells. Therefore, eating healthier and losing weight not only makes you look better, but can also change your epigenetics, changing the way you build muscle, store fat, etc. 

What is unknown is just how fast this happens. For example, it is unknown for how long someone has to be fit before there are significant changes in epigenetics to then be passed on to the children. 

Edit: Never got around to explaining Epigenetics. The videos do a good job but the TLDW is that the Epigenome is a way of reading the DNA. The DNA doesn't change, but the Epigenome changes a lot based on how you act and behave. The Epigenome determines how strongly certain parts of the DNA get expressed. So essentially, take a person who went through a famine and survived, their epigenome will change to allow them to survive through extended starvation. This is then passed to their children and as a result, their children have a leg up on surviving a famine. There was even a study on this exact things done in Sweden.",eli5

32og5x,Why is it so common for europeans to speak english as a second language? As opposed to french or spanish or mandarin?,"English got spread around the world through British colonisation. In many former British colonies English is still an important language, or even an official language.

One former British colony went on to be hugely influential in world politics and trade: the United States of America.

The USA were major players setting up the UN, with the result that the UN's primary language is English.

American brands moved across the world, bringing an English speaking culture with them. This caused some interesting situations: a Volkswagen factory in India ended up adopting English as its main language, because none of the German managers knew Hindi, and none of the Indian workers knew German, but they did all know English as a second language. This kind of thing further reinforces English's position.

American music crossed the Atlantic, bringing this hip, popular new sound with lyrics in English. It became cool to understand and speak English. American TV made the transition as well. (Many German people I know speak excellent English thanks to watching *Friends* and other popular shows in English with subtitles.)

I wouldn't say that any one of these made English the global lingua franca, but the combination certainly did.

English has a few more things going for it: it is very easy to learn English well enough to be understood. ~~It's~~^1 Its grammar is simple, similar to several European languages already, and flexible. (In English: ""the dog bites the man"", ""the dog is biting the man"" and ""the man is bitten by the dog"" are all valid constructions. We have very permissive grammar rules in that way, which makes the language easier to learn.) We also have very simple verb conjugations (to run; I run; you run; he/she/it runs; we run; you run (or ""you all run""); they run. Compare to Spanish: correr; corro; corres; corre; corremos; corréis; corren.)

English also has, I think, fewer idioms than any other languages I know. (Compare it to Japanese, which can feel like nothing but idiomatic imagery sometimes.) This probably isn't a big deal, since most people will avoid idioms when they're talking to non-native speakers anyway.

As for the specific languages you mention:

- French: used to be the lingua franca, until it fell out of favour. It's still commonly taught in England, and the rest of Western Europe, though.

- Spanish: Still widely spoken in former Spanish colonies. Maybe if Mexico became the world power than the USA is everyone would know Spanish.

- Mandarin: The most commonly spoken language in the world, perhaps, but not widely spoken. It's only spoken in China, and is not - therefore - a global language.

6ng84o,How did the Gyroscope fuiding system work on the V-2 Rocket?,The gyroscope system was quite basic and still in use for almost any flying vehicles today. The principles of the V2 guidance system would be the same in a modern quadcopter although electronics have replaced mechanics. A rotating gyroscope is resisting rotations in two axis. So if the rocket is changing direction the gyroscope exerts a force on the mounts. If you were to hook up these mounts to hydraulic valves that would operate the control surfaces of the rocket you could counteract the changing direction and make the rocket fly straight. Some missiles even have the gyroscopes output directly to the control surfaces. Of course this primitive system only allows the rocket to go straight but that is enough for the launch. After the engine is out of fuel the rocket is on a ballistic course towards its target and the gyroscopes and control surfaces can not change that.,eli5

It could even generate more pollution since part of energy is lost on the eletricity network.,"Simple reason: they burn gas for for fuel.
Many and most companies don't use coal for fuel anymore so the energy from grid electricity is cleaner than by an internal combustion engine. Nuclear, hydro and green power technologies make these sources of power much less of an emitter of greenhouse gases. Even power that is generated through combustion has gone towards natural gas or biofuels because of emissions regulations.

Or can they all survive every enviroment? Thx","There are actually many types of pigeon around the world.  However, the ones you commonly see in cities are the domestic pigeon, which is a specific variety of rock pigeon.

The rock pigeon is the world's oldest domesticated bird.  As the name implies, these are birds that have been domesticated by humans.  The rock pigeon was selected for its ability to return ""home"" to a specific location.  As such, prior to modern telecommunications, these pigeons were used world-wide to send messages over large distances.

As a result, domesticated pigeons can be found in most parts of the world because they were bred as the precursor to the Internet (see RFC 1149 for a humorous nod to this relationship).

What you normally see in cities today are feral pigeons -- domestic pigeons that have been left to fly wild, that no longer have a stoop to fly home to.

If you leave the cities, you'll find other types of pigeons abound, adapted to their local environment.  Domestic Pigeons, however, were bred to survive one environment very well: the city.",eli5

7oh8x7,Why certain frequencies make things rattle/buzz more than others? ,"When you strike a material, it vibrates, it wiggles back and forth until all the energy you gave it is dissipated back out into the environment.

If you keep striking the object, you keep starting this cycle of wiggling over again and again.

The material and shape of the object determine how long it takes a wave of energy to move from one side of the object to the other. If you strike an object at just the right frequency, the new wave of energy from the current strike lines up with the wave of energy from the previous strike and the object wiggles more intensely. When  this happens we say the object is resonating. Since the material and shape of the object don't change when you change the frequency, this tends to only happen at very specific frequencies.

20qguk,"What causes stock prices to move up or down throughout the day? To my understanding, stock values will jump when a company is doing well, and fall when a company is doing poorly. But what causes the fluctuations throughout the day? Is there a live feed of how well the company is doing? ","In general, the fluctuations in a day will depend on multiple factors, but the most basic is still supply and demand.

Lets say Company X opens at $5.00 a share. There are trades back and forth - the spread is $5.00 Bid (how much people want to buy it for), and $5.10 Ask (how much people want to sell it for).

The 'spread' is just the difference between Bid and Ask. Usually when there is a lot of volume (meaning a lot of people buying and selling), the spread is smaller.

Anyways, lets say on Monday, Company X is just OK. Normal buying and selling has the price going up and down between $5.00 and $5.10 as people buy and sell. Not much going on here. One trader might be willing to ask for $5.08, and the price will drop to $5.08 if someone buys at that amount. Someone else might sell for $5.10, and if someone buys at that amount, thats what the stock is worth at that moment.

Now comes along Tuesday. Company X releases some positive financial data. Demand is *up*.

Now the ask has jumped to $5.20, a fairly solid increase. Bids follow because people want to get in on the Companies better financial prospects.

The ask will rise as much as it can before it eventually levels off - someone might set an ask of $5.50, but if no one bids on that, it goes nowhere. There is an upper limit where people will buy, and people who want to sell will sell at that price.

The price goes up and down, but finally settles at $5.18 for the day. Not a bad increase.

On Wednesday, Company X releases more data, and notes that while they have some good news, there is also bad news, and their quarterly results will look bad. 

Now people are worried. They begin to sell their stocks for $5.17 in order to get rid of them. The price continues to drop as more people try to exit their positions. Buyers want it for $5.10-5.12, so the sellers have to hit that number to sell.

By the end of the day, we had a high of $5.18 and a low of $5.10. 

Technically, from Monday, we are still up 10 cents. But we had a much better day on Tuesday, and Wednesday closed a little lower. Depending on how the Company manages the news, they might be able to re-ignite positive influence among potential investors and get the volume moving again, and hopefully continuing to increase the value of the stock.

Google finance and yahoo finance have excellent live feeds for how a companies stock value is doing. This is *not* always indicative of how well the company is doing - investors have to do a lot of analysis of company financials and industry movements to get a better idea of what a stock is worth.

remember - until someone buys or sells at a particular price, the stock is worthless. So if I have a bid for Company X at $1,000,000, and no one has an ask at that price, nothing is going to happen there.",eli5

A weaker spot in the hot air will suddenly let through cold air, which will rush to the ground, creating a downstream air current, while the sudden void were that cold air was suddenly sucks in the hot air underneath, creating an upstream current. As this happen, the speed of the currents increase as the air rising now bring in moisture from the ground, cooling further the cold air at the top, increasing the weight of the cold air.  As the speed of this increase,  a rotation is created and as the air accelerate as it falls to the ground, the speed increase, thus tightening the rotation, creating the funnel look of tornadoes. The strength of the tornado is a factor of the heat difference between the hot air mass on the ground and the cold air mass atop of it, and the size the air masses.",eli5

367apj,What would be the economical effects if we all went bald? ,"This is a really interesting, unique question. Good job OP. In the counterfactual world in which say a common virus causes alopecia, a number of businesses could potentially go under: think companies that make / provide shampoos, hair dyes, conditioners, hair dryers, tweezers, razors, scissors, that blue chemical that barber scissors are stored in, body wax, laser hair removal, delousing chemicals, hair styling/ cutting. Also then think further down the supply chain including the companies that produce the chemicals and materials that go into all of those products. Think of the companies that produce pyrithione zinc, the main ingredient in many shampoos or benzalkonium chloride, the main ingredient in barbicide. What about companies hired to advertise just for men or the models hired to model the products? All gone. 

Humans being humans, we would probably find some new ways to adorn our heads and bodies such as head tattoos, artificial hair implants, bedazzlers, etc. the industries of which would absorb some of the workforce/ industry reduced as a result of global baldness. As Noftastic said, the hat industry would probably take off.

2ah0ti,Why it's forbidden to plug a UPS to a surge Protector? or Daisy chain surge suppressors (assuming you are not overloading them). The UPS only has 300 Joules Surge protection so I want to augment this with a better quality Surge protector liket he Tripp-Lite ISOBAR that has 3k+ joules of energy dissipation.  So my idea was to plug the ISOBAR to the WALL then the UPS to the ISOBAR and all electronics to the UPS.  Why is it not recommended?,"UPS's and surge protectors both use Metal Oxide Varistors as components in the circuit.

The way these things work is by converting excess voltage to heat.  They are designed that they have a ""clamping voltage"" which is the maximum amount of voltage they allow through, before they start absorbing the excess voltage in the form of heat.

Placing Metal Oxide Varistors in series (daisy chained) causes the clamping voltage to be raised.  So if you have two MOV's that were each individually designed to allow  < 120V, after you connect them in series they could allow more than 120V.  Too much voltage could damage electrical devices and start fires.",eli5
2ioztw,Why does the stock market react so violently when performance misses expectations? Isn't an estimate just an educated best-guess? Why freak out that analysts can't actually predict the future?,"The value of a company's stock is supposed to reflect the total value of the company for all time.  The value of a company's stock can therefore be separated into two portions.  There is the ""current"" portion which depends on the amount of money and other assets that the company currently has.  Then there is the ""future"" portion which depends on how much the company is going to make in the future.  The current assets of a company are always known, so the ""current"" portion of the stock's price can be known at any time. The future income of a company is much harder to determine so the ""future"" portion of the stock's price is just a best-guess.

For steady, boring companies like Walmart, the total assets are huge, and the future income is small compared to the total assets.  This means that the stock's price is fairly certain.

For new and exciting companies like start-ups, the current assets are small so the ""current"" portion of the stock is small.  The potential earnings are highly variable, so the ""future"" portion of the stock price will be large and hard to guess.

If you receive news about the startup company that allows you to make a better guess about the future earnings, you can immediately factor that in to the ""future"" portion of the stock price.  Since this portion makes up the vast majority of the stock price, any change in this portion will drastically affect the stock price.

 >  Why freak out that analysts can't actually predict the future?

The truth is that they are not freaking out.  They made their best guess at first.  Unfortunately, when performance misses expectations, they have to factor that in to the ""future"" portion of the stock price.  When they do, they determine that the stock is actually worth much less than they originally said.  This causes the stock price to fall drastically.

Edit: thanks for those answering. Penguin-herder and arad21 gave opposing but strong-enough points.

Basically the answer is: We don't know the answer with certainty, do it at your own risk.","The inside of your car gets hot.  Even in the winter, the sun is coming in through the windows.

1oroj9,"Why does it seem that everyone on Reddit is anti-conservative? Almost every thread I see that deals with politics is replied to with a mostly democratic standpoint, or should I say liberal? Republican views are hated for the most part, and that bothers me. I feel like there should be some sort of 50/50 split and intelligent debate, but all I see is the liberals trumping (flaming) any sort of conservative view. 

I'm essentially moderate so I don't really have a stand, I'm just curious.","There are several reason why non-republicans seems to be overrepresented on reddit.

Part of it is simply demographics. conservatives tend to be older than progressives on average almost everywhere. Reddit has a very young audience with the majority of users in their teens and twenties. Naturally that means that a group under-represent in the 30 years and under demography will likely be under-represented on reddit.

The second part is that reddit is not exclusively American. while the majority of participants in any given discussion about American politics will be Americans there will always be a sizeable group of non-Americans in there too. Most of Europe and the prosperous parts of Asia are politically to the left of America. By western European standards Obama barely qualifies as a centrist. The Average non-American on reddit is simply more likely to side against Republicans.

The third and perhaps most subtle factor is that conservatives tend to clumb together. They gather together in groups that share their beliefs. This is  in part an artefact of the ideology and in part made worse by being outnumbered elsewhere. If the conservatives that have taken refuge in conservative only groups would distribute themselves better through the rest of the site the whole thing would be slightly less unbalanced.

You can't honestly expect just because there are two side to an argument that both will be equally represented  in a discussion. Simple demographics won't allow it in this case.",eli5

The headline is mostly bullshit. It's true only in the sense that pretty much all fresh surface water on the planet started out as rainwater.

What that guy was actually jailed for was illegally damming a stream and using it to create three artificial ponds on his property, thus depriving his downstream neighbors of the use of the stream. He was convicted multiple times over an 11-year span, mostly for refusing court orders to drain the reservoirs. Finally the court gave him 30 days in jail.

Water rights, and the laws that cover them, go back thousands of years. The bottom line is that while you're usually allowed certain uses of the water that flows through your property, you don't *own* it just because it passes through.

As a general rule, you can't do things that disrupt your downstream neighbors of their use of the water, or do things that disrupt the local water table and so forth.

It appears to be incredibly simple and something that a talent-less child could paint. Why would anyone spend as much as that on a painting? Is there something that is actually special that I, or any casual observer, am missing? Or is it simply the name of the artist that sells?","It is not so often the art itself that is worth $45 million (or whatever) but the fact that it came from an artist that is highly respected and regarded...or has some other history associated with it. 

High price art, doesn't just become high priced without some association. That association might be the artist that created it, or it might be related to a pivotal time in history. 

Think of it this way. If Steve McQueen owns an average car (let's say...a fastback Ford Mustang) and it is then sold, it is still, technically, just like all the other Mustangs. But...because he owned it, it has a much higher value. 

Additionally, if a very influential artist, let's pick Claude Monet (the founder of the impressionist movement) painted something on the back of a napkin while ordering some pasta, that painting would be highly valuable...despite that it's just a goofy painting on a napkin. 

Just think of how valuable certain everyday items are that belonged to John Lennon....or maybe a gun that was used in the American Civil War, because of how it represented a pivotal time in U.S. history.  

So...it's not like you can say...""I could have done THAT painting...why can't I then fetch $45 million for what would be a similar painting?"" 

Lastly...you also have to keep in mind that sometimes art is easily replicated, but not easily created. Music is a good example of this. A very simple Taylor Swift song will earn millions of dollars and hundreds of wannabes will learn how to sing and play it on the guitar. But...creating that music is a work of genius. It's an original, created from nothing...and sometimes, these originals are works of art that started a whole new movement or had a profound effect on a generation of artist or people. Nirvana and grunge, or Elvis Presley and rock are good examples of this. Creating something from scratch...is...hard work that takes talent. 

Now...this painting of yours, that sold for $45 million is a Mark Rothko original. And...even if YOU don't know who that is, people that follow years of art creation do...and he is a very famous Russian painter.

One last thing. Sometimes...some of this art is actually quite amazing. The average eye can't see it, just as much as the average person may not fully understand how great ULYSSES by James Joyce is. So...there is some art that may look like a bunch of spilled paint, but to trained eye, they see much more. Not always, but usually. 

EDIT: Okay...one more thing. Sometimes art sells for higher than normal because of what certain investors see in the art market. So...the chap that purchased this painting, at $45 mil, may know something that the rest of us don't, and therefore, may find himself in a position where this painting is then worth $60 million, five years from now.",eli5

3xeq2g,Why do we need sleep? ,"Registered sleep tech here.

I like to explain it to my patient's like a car. If you have a car without fuel the car won't go. Your body is the same way, it gets the fuel by sleeping. My more detailed explanation is below:

 Sleep is a VERY important part of you life. You will spend about 1/3 of it sleeping, it is when your body heals, restores, and saves your memory. Studies have shown that your brain actually prioritizes memory to keep what is most relevant first (this was tested by teaching a group of people a pattern, some were allowed to sleep others weren't, some were told they would be tested and others not, the ones who sleep and we're told to remember the pattern had 100% success, the others were hit or miss most notably the people who didn't sleep and didn't know they would be tested.) your sleep is also responsible for a lot of your health. Your body burns fat and converts it into energy for the day faster while sleeping, it also gives the body a chance to heal as you aren't putting it under any stress. 



I'm also going to take this chance for a PSA. If you:
- wake up feeling tired all the time
 - wake up feeling like you're choking or gasping for air
- snore
- have a neck circumference over 16 inches
-Fall asleep at inappropriate times
-The inability to sleep 
-Creepy crawly sensations in your legs that makes you have to move them when your trying to sleep 
Please talk to a doctor about a possible sleep study. Sleep is honestly THE most important part of your life, if your sleep isn't right your body will pay in the long run.

5hxho7,Why is Microsoft forcing their updates on users?,"Giving people the option of updating makes for many different configurations of systems, all of which need to be tested. That's why they changed to forcing updates on everything and you can't select the specific package. Now they only have the ""latest"" version of each OS, and you have to have that latest version, or a previous version that was at that time the latest. You no longer need to test if version A of application X works with version B of application Y, since that's not something that you can have, X and Y will either both be version A or both version B, and A is tested when A is released and B is tested when B is released.

As for the forcing to windows 10 thing, it has more to do with keeping their users at a current operating system. They had huge problems with Windows XP, they couldn't get people to use windows 10 because people still had XP, not maintaining XP gave people all sorts of problems, and left active users ignored. Businesses refused to upgrade because the differences in 10 years of development were huge, and required large changes on their part to be compatible. This in turn drove Microsoft to spend loads of money maintaining something they had no intention of supporting in the future. And at the same time, it prevented new applications from using new features because XP users still exists and those new features would be incompatible with them. This in turn made new windows 10 apps worse, because companies refused to use the windows 10 features. This difficulty in switching from XP to 10 was so great, it meant new users had to go through a complete change, the road blocks were as great as switching from XP to Mac or XP to Linux. That's very bad for Microsoft, it removes barriers to their competitors.

Doing frequent updates with small changes removes all these problems, businesses and developers need to make small changes to existing apps to stay up to date, and all the new features are available to all users almost immediately, enhancing everyone's user experience while keeping systems secure (no more old outdated apps installed).

As for the size, it's not a huge issue, Windows is under 20GB (in practice, looks like 12-13GB), even on a 128GB SSD, that's not bad, these updates don't have a huge effect on it as they all uninstall the previous version, maybe in 3 years you can expect it to grow to 25GB, but not much more than that, and it's certainly isn't going to have a meaningful impact on drive space over the lifetime of the computer. All that lost space that you see is NOT windows, but all the other applications and files that you accumulate over the lifetime of the system, the updates are not impacting that.",eli5

8xbopw,Why is it important to drink water after a massage,"It isn't.

The theory is that massages release lactic acid and other toxins from the muscles and you drink water to flush them from your system but it isn't true. Lactic acid isn't a toxin but an energy source for the muscles. And these ""toxins"" (which nobody can pinpoint to any specific chemicals) cannot be harmful to you in the quantities that they exist in your muscles. If they were harmful, the muscle would've been dead or you'd have other serious issues.

Now, this isn't to say that drinking water isn't good for you, just that it isn't *necessary* after a massage. Hydrated muscles work better and you feel better. Many people are under hydrated, so drinking an extra liter of water can make you feel better with only the side effect of you having to pee more later.",eli5

However, if the market is good, then a landlord knows that he can wait maybe a month and lease it to someone else for full price, and probably make more money than if he gave it to you now for a hundred bucks off a month.

awvxmp,How come water stays carbonated at normal pressure for hours? ,"Don't think of carbonation as just bubbles of CO2 in the water, it is actually CO2 dissolving into the soda. Basically, CO2 can dissolve into water just like salt dissolves into water. Water absorbs the most carbon dioxide when it is cold, so the beverage is chilled prior to being exposed with the gas. Once it comes out of the machine, the soda has dissolved the most CO2 that it can, and therefore there is some left in the form of bubbles that rise to the surface. 

When kept cold, the CO2 will remain in the soda for hours, even if left out. This is one reason that soda is oftentimes served with ice. However, as the water warms up, the amount of CO2 that it is capable of keeping dissolved decreases, and the CO2 aspirates out of the solution. After the drink is warm enough, most of the CO2 escapes and leaves the flat soda behind.",eli5

In addition, anyone who would be voting for the green party almost certainly would be defecting from the Democratic party.

I've made a single coil pick up before and when i would wave a magnet over it, it would make weird sounds. I'm wondering why this doesn't happen with real pickups.","As I'm sure you know, pickups work because your guitar strings induce an electric current in them, kinda like a super weak generator. The key here though is that the strings are in motion: They're rapidly vibrating back and forth right above the pickups, and it's that motion that causes the magnetic field to oscillate and induce a current. 

When you wave a magnet over the pickups it's relatively slow - not the rapid several-passes-per-second that your guitar strings do. Because of this there's not that much current being produced.",eli5

But they all seem totally normal in every other thing. Why aren't their intelligence show up in other things? What makes one's intelligence specific to chess?

Note: English isn't my mother tongue, please keep it simple.","Chess is an extraordinarily simple game. You can learn everything there is to know about the game in a very short period of time. The issue is that it takes a great deal of intuition to become one of the greats, and intuition can't be taught. 

For example, you can very quickly learn how the pieces move, why it's best to keep your knights centralized or trade off bad bishops in closed positions, but seeing that abstract mate-in-four that requires you to sacrifice your queen, a rook, and a pawn is just something that you have to -see-, you can't be taught it. 

Chess strategy involves a lot of different aspects; it's not ""seeing four moves ahead"", it's understanding positions and tactics and making assumptions based on what you might do if you were your opponent. It's not even about studying the great games and trying to mimic them (it'll never happen).

I'm not the most educated in this field but I've heard countless tales of people being left stranded and without money after their insurer refused to compensate them for damages, why can they do this? Why hasn't a law been set up to counteract this?

EDIT: Ok, I understand I was wrong about them ripping you off, I just wanted to know why people had said that.","I work in the insurance claims industry (homeowners insurance), your premise is incorrect but I understand why people think this is the case. Insurance companies *must* follow their the wording in the policies they write. Period, no exceptions.

However, what many people do not realize is how complicated a policy is. Let's look at an example:

There is a storm with heavy rain and that rain water enters your house. Are you covered? 

If the storm blew out a window and the rain came in through the window it is considered storm damage. If the rain falls to the ground and comes up through the basement sump pump well (for those that have them) that is a sump pump failure. If the drainage tile of your house is connected with your sewer drain and the rain water backs up through the floor drain of your basement, that is considered drain backup. If the rain water comes through the foundation wall into the basement that is considered flood damage.

Each of these different types of losses (drain backup, sump pump failure, ect) requires its own rider on the policy and if a homeowner does not have that rider they are not covered. Most people think they are either covered from rain damaging or they are not, and that is incorrect. It depends entirely on *how* that rain entered their house and most people are covered for some but not all of the ways they could be damaged.",eli5

He found that very intelligent people can struggle with depression due to a shortfall in achievements compared to their perceived potential.  As someone who has been told they're ""so smart"" all their lives, you should be working at NASA now right? Then how come you ended up in a cubicle living out [Office Space](_URL_0_)? 

It's definitely because you're not an asshole that can't work with others.  They just should do it your way because it's objectively superior due to your overwhelming intelligence.  They're just dumb and should be ignored like the sheep they are.  

Gladwell found that intelligence only goes so far.  Once you crossed a threshold of ""smart enough"" the real difference between becoming a ranch hand in the middle of Missouri vs founding the Manhattan project was your ability to work as a team.  Fact is, no matter how smart you are it takes too long for you to learn enough about rocket science, material properties, chemistry, astrophysics, finance, and welding. 
 

If you cannot communicate, all that genious goes to waste, as nobody in the rest of the world can use it.  This makes you feel like a child again with something REALLY IMPORTANT to say but nobody will listen. Or when they do, they just don't ""get it"" because you can't boil it down to a HS reading level, as that would be ""beneath you"".

ufqwu,"Why are their different levels of octane for gasoline (regular, premium, etc) and how does that effect my car (and why do some cars need regular while others need premium)? ","To put this into something a five year old might understand...

Imagine we gave you three fully-blown balloons. We wrote 87 on one, 89 on another, and 92 on the last one. That number indicates how hard you can squeeze the balloon before it pops. You can squeeze the 87 balloon a little before it pops, the 89 balloon can be squeezed a bit more, and the 92 can be squeezed even harder. The harder you can squeeze that balloon, the bigger the pop.

Now to bring that back up to speed (ha-ha! car pun)...

The ratings you see on pumps (87%, 89%, 92%) correspond to the ratio of octane to heptane. Those chemicals aren't necessarily important, but it is important to know that the higher that percentage, the more the gas can be squeezed before it ignites and goes pop. Just like with the balloons, the more compression, the bigger the pop and the more power you get from it.

HOWEVER, your engine has to be designed to take advantage of higher octanes or else pouring 92% in an engine designed for 87% is just wasteful. On the other end, pouring 87% in an engine designed for 92% can be damaging to the engine.",eli5

In the 1980s, the average well depth in California farms was around 10 feet. Today, it's closer on 600-800 feet. California's population has continued to grow for decades, even as it's had to seek more and more water supplies from out of state or upstate, building pipelines through the mountains.

California's use keeps going up. It's water table has been slowly depleting, and now it's almost gone. At the same time, climate change has marginally decreased annual rainfall.

The fact is that California is overpopulated and overcultivated for it's natural water supplies. We're going to start supplementing the civilian water supply with desalination, but there is nothing that anyone can do for the farms, which use well water. Both sides will blame each other, but neither side's use impacts the other.

If nobody knows about your drug, nobody will prescribe it.  Advertisements reach doctors directly, and also indirectly after patients start asking about it.

There were some people who talked like this in real life, particularly super rich people in Boston/Connecticut/parts of Long Island in the early 20th century (when it's real life people, it's also known as ""Connecticut lockjaw"" or ""Larchmont lockjaw."") [Katherine Hepburn](_URL_1_) and [George Plimpton](_URL_3_) are good examples of people who really did talk like that all the time, it was their natural accent. 

But the reason it's all over movies and stuff from that time is that back then it was considered very important for an actor to try and lose any trace of regional or ethnic identity and learn to talk ""proper,"" e.g., like rich people. Almost every actor with an Italian or Irish or Jewish last name would change it into something more WASPy and American-sounding ([example](_URL_4_)). The default ""rich person"" way of talking was the Mid Atlantic accent, so people would artificially adopt it. 

It fell out of fashion, though, mostly in the 1960s, as people got more proud of their own origins and wanted to stick up for them and not be forced to lose their identity to fit in. When that started to happen, instead of the accent seeming like how everyone should try and sound it started to seem fake and unnatural, a joke.

It seems that breeding for less aggressive behavior results in less adrenaline, and  corticosteroids in the blood, as well as a set of other physical changes (e.g. droopy ears which is far more common on domesticated animals than wild ones). The fact that there was a set of connected physical changes was a great surprise and has affected a lot of thinking about domestication.

One other difference with domesticated animals is how close to people the animal can be and still feed. One theory is that wolves who followed humans to feed off their scraps did better if they were comfortable eating near people instead of needing to take their food far away to eat. As a result wolves may have effectively domesticated themselves.",eli5

1998 ISS agreement

In addition to the international treaties that have been negotiated at the United Nations, the nations participating in the International Space Station have entered into the 1998 Agreement among the governments of Canada, Member States of the European Space Agency, Japan, Russian Federation, and the United States of America concerning cooperation on the Civil International Space Station (the ""Space Station Agreement""). This Agreement provides, among other things, that NASA is the lead agency in coordinating the member states' contributions to and activities on the space station, and that each nation has jurisdiction over its own module(s). The Agreement also provides for protection of intellectual property and procedures for criminal prosecution. This Agreement may very well serve as a model for future agreements regarding international cooperation in facilities on the Moon and Mars, where the first off-world colonies and scientific/industrial bases are likely to be established.[11]

Whenever I try to explain to people why are microwaves not unhealthy I get stuck at this point. I know it vibrates microwaves water and fat molecules, but we have those too, so why is it safe for us ?","The Microwaves from microwave ovens do not ""get out"" of the device.
If you look at the glass of the microwave you can see there is another sheet backing with lots of holes in.  This is a Faraday Cage, this stops the microwaves from coming out of the glass.
Microwaves work by flipping water molecules around in rapid succession.  Due to the nature of AC, the microwaves being generated rapidly change from one direction to another (based on the hertz of your wall socket).  Water is a dipole molecule, meaning one side is more negatively charge than the other side, because of the distribution of electrons, when microwaves pass through water, all the water molecules line up with the waves, then when they switch, they line up again, effectively flipping 180 degrees.  Any molecule that is dipole will be affected by microwaves and will warm up.

As for whether or not microwaves are dangerous in general, in you could put your arm in a microwave oven, you would definitely begin to warm the blood up you arm.  Although microwaves are non-ionizing, they can still lead to cancers if there is heavy dosage (this is more akin to microwave radars and thing not microwave ovens)",eli5

3c4qpf,"I heard that water on the Earth came from asteroids, but how did it get there? ","Stars shine because of nuclear fusion. That means, hydrogen becomes helium+energy.

However, in heavier stars, heavier elements like neon or oxygen can be used as fuel to provide even heavier elements (up to iron, once a star enters the iron age, it will basically cumulate iron until it dies since iron consumes way more energy than fusion can provide to become another element; it will just suck all the energy and kill the star). A wide number of elements and isotopes can be produced during super novas.

So oxygen and hydrogen are quite often met in the universe. It doesn't take long for those two to combine into water, among dust particles, which later form planets, asteroids and smaller stars, trough the accretion disks. So, short answer, water was there for just as long as the metals that asteroids are made of. A part of it was already here too.",eli5

2b08ej,Why isn't Edward Snowden protected under the Whistleblower Protection Programs? ,"* First, the government says, he did not expose the kinds of actions covered by whistle-blower protections — illegal conduct, fraud, waste or abuse. 

* Other officials have argued that the programs revealed by Snowden are illegal or unconstitutional. For now, they are presumptively legal, given the assent of members of Congress and the special court known as FISA that oversees intelligence operations.

But suppose Snowden’s supporters are right, and what he exposed was illegal conduct after all.

* Then he would face a second problem: The Federal Whistle-blower Protection Act protects the public disclosure of “a violation of any law, rule, or regulation” only “if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law.” 

In other words, Snowden could claim whistle-blower protection only if he took his concerns to the NSA’s inspector general or to a member of one of the congressional intelligence committees with the proper security clearances.

2uizxp,"How come I do not feel hungry in the morning if I don't eat breakfast, but if I do, I find myself wanting something to eat or drink. On top of this, I also find myself more tired if I have eaten something rather than if I haven't.","It's actually kind of simple really.

If you don't eat breakfast, you're body looks to other ways to begin fueling itself. If there's nothing in your stomach, it seeks out and uses glycogen (stored energy from food you've recently eaten) to run itself, and also to help your brain function properly. (Your brain gets the first go at any stored energy.)

Naturally, when this begins to happen, and even through there's no food in your stomach, your body stops reminding you that you're hungry, and gets right away to burning up any energy reserves (again, the 'glycogen').

The reason you're probably feeling tired is because -- and let's say you ate something carb-heavy, such as a bagel, or a stack of pancakes -- considerable amounts of blood is now beginning to flow to your abdomen, to help to begin processing all of the stuff you've just eaten. (Part of the reason why you feel 'sleepy' after a big meal.)

Your body telling you you need a drink, or wanting something to eat soon after breakfast, is basically just your metabolism speeding up and/or requiring hydration so as to move the process along more efficiently.

Quotas are designed with this in mind, so that the department has a rough minimum expectation for how much money will flow into the department via fines.

Incentivizing policing: Like any other field of work, management must ensure that employees are doing their jobs. By setting quotas, officers on the beat actively look for people breaking the law, not just to satisfy their civic duty of upholding the law, but also so that they won't get in trouble for not policing enough.",eli5

That's because when light travels from material to material, it slightly changes direction, making things appear to be in slightly different places, or slightly bigger or smaller, etc . . . 

If you heat air enough, then it acts like a different ""material"" compared to other, cooler air.  The air over a grill is that hot, so whatever is on the other side of the air is like the pencil in the water.  But, unlike the water, the air is moving, shifting, cooling, blowing, and so on.  As a result, it doesn't look like a single shifted image, but shimmers and ""distorts.""",eli5
5dcxyf,"What were the problems with ""earmarks"" and why was their ban so controversial, should I be concerned about the possibility of a ban being lifted as is being proposed? ","Earmarks in and of themselves are not always bad. You might have one earmark where say--Michigan--wants to bring the Mackinaw Bridge up to date.

Because the bridge is in Michigan (a state), but carries Interstate 75 (a federal infrastructure project) across the gap between the Upper/Lower Peninsulas both entities get involved.

Now if say a Minnesota legislator were to say ""ok, I can support that, but let's add a rider that I-94 across the Mississippi is also brought up to date"" in the same budget...it is unlikely that anyone would raise an eyebrow. This is an earmark, but it's related and one item is not necessarily holding the other hostage.

The problem arises when the earmarks are overdone. A third representative may refuse to vote on the bill unless money is included to build a school or community center, a fourth may ask for money for health care, a fifth may decide their district doesn't really need anything but there is a need for jobs (pressure from voters) and add on some unnecessary project on the side. They are taking advantage of the likelihood that this bill will pass in an effort to ride their own project (which should really have its own bill) through on the coat-tails of the title project.

This becomes an even bigger issue if they hold hostage a must-pass bill for a military or other critical item *that has nothing to do with their earmark at all*.

So for now I vote that each rep pull together their various related projects with other similar projects and propose them as smaller bills on their own rather than trying to tack on every little thing to something that they think will or must pass.

Yeah, some things will get bypassed, but those can be dealt with individually (and passed other ways) vs something that no one cares about being attached to something that everyone cares about simply for the sake of ""advantage"" or ""blackmail"" or ""hostage"" or ""coat-tailing"" or whatever you want to call it.",eli5

Is it racism, or is it physiological? (really not trying to offend anyone, just an honest question)","I heard about a study conducted a few years ago. Granted, that is not much of a cite, but you can take my word for it. In the study, a team of researchers gathered children and let them play football. The researchers took pictures of the children before they started playing. The researchers then took note of what position each child played. 

They then showed the pictures of the children to other children not in the same area and asked this second group of children to judge the best looking child or the one they would most want to be friends with. What was found was that the child who played quarterback was more likely to be rated the best looking or the most likely for the rater to be friends with. 

What we can take from this is that children will pick the best looking or friendliest person and let him be QB. That child will have more experience as the QB and should be expected to do better if he decides to play football as he grows up.

38lkft,Why do companies like Twitter allow ISIS to use their services to recruit? ,"It's less that they allow recruitment and more that they have no way to stop them. Finding all ISIS sympathetic accounts and deleting them would take an enormous data crunching operation searching through billions of posts to find only those which favor a specific viewpoint. We have text recognition, but computers do not understand the *meanings* of words the way we do, and the problem is compunded by the fact that people don't use whole words or even consistent abbreviations on Twitter.

This is why groups like Anonymous have been isolating and reporting ISIS accounts, because that still takes humans to do. There is no way to automate it, and if Twitter wanted to hire enough people to comb through every post themselves they would quickly go out of business.

Edit: think about it this way: let's say someone tweets ""Hangin' with my buds in Baghdad!"" and then posts a picture. The picture is of a bunch of severed heads, but we do not have photographic processing technology capable of identifying severed heads, and that text isn't obviously in favor of any political view.

They get social stimulation from being around other dogs and people that they have come to see as good friends. For many singleton pets this is the only time they will be around lots of other dogs and even if they are allowed no direct contact they still feel a great sense of camaraderie. Plus there's all the physical stimulation from the handling and massage-like feelings they get from their bath. Brushing causes increases blood flow to the skin which feels very good. Once they know the routine and how to behave they feel very confident and happy at being told how good they are over and over during the process.

Then when they get home they are fussed over much more than usual, which in turn causes them to do things that garner even more attention like prancing or acting silly.

All in all a visit to a quality grooming shop is a very good time for a dog.

19i4if,Why is the Voting Rights Act a bad thing? ,"The short answer is that it is not. 

The Voting Rights Act was passed to make it possible for black Americans to vote without being ""disenfranchised"" (a long word that means to have their rights taken away). See, for a long time black Americans couldn't vote at all, because they were slaves. 

After the Civil War was over, black Americans got the right to vote, but a lot of the states in the South passed laws that required people to pay a ""poll tax"", which kept poor people from voting- and most blacks were desperately poor in those areas. They also had laws that required people to pass a literacy test- proving they could read and write- before voting, and again, many blacks were illiterate.

And even those who worked to get past all these hurdles found themselves being intimidated by violence. The purpose was to keep black people from voting.

The Voting Rights Act changed all of that. It didn't do so overnight but it was and is a critical piece of the road that we continue to walk down toward equality in this country for everyone.",eli5

","A fridge and AC work in the same way: they cool one side and heat another.  They both move heat, but actually do not move any air.

ACs cool your home and heat the outside air.  If you ran an AC inside it would cool on one side and heat on the other meaning the room never actually gets any cooler.

1pla7z,Why did NASA stop sending Space Shuttles? ,"Because the Space Shuttle programs *was a total, unmitigated, disaster*.

People don't talk about this, but the Shuttles have all pretty much sucked.  Consider that the system was designed in the 1970's, and that the program had several mandates:

* Reliability
* Safety
* Cost-effectiveness

In retrospect, the Shuttle program achieved **none** of those goals.  

**The Shuttle wasn't reliable** - It had to be grounded *literally hundreds of times* for maintenance.  It was originally intended to fly once a *week*.  The best we ever did was 9 times in one year.  That year was 1985.  A month later the Challenger exploded, which brings us to:

**The Shuttle wasn't safe** - It killed 13 astronauts and a schoolteacher.  The last 7 astronauts?  We knew the damn thing wasn't safe, but we sent them up anyway, in this ridiculous flaming deathtrap.  And here's the poetical part: We saw the foam break off and hit the wing during liftoff.  And we still instructed them to attempt re-entry.  Of course, what else could NASA have done at that point?

Here's what the Director of Mission Operations [had to say](_URL_0_) about this issue:

 >  *You know, there is nothing we can do about damage to the TPS. If it has been damaged it's probably better not to know. I think the crew would rather not know. Don't you think it would be better for them to have a happy successful flight and die unexpectedly during entry than to stay on orbit, knowing that there was nothing to be done, until the air ran out?*

**The Shuttle wasn't cheap** - At no point in the history of the program was sending satellites up via the Shuttle *ever* [cheaper than using disposable rockets](_URL_1_).

Oh, and here's the best part:  The Shuttle was underpowered.  It couldn't reach the polar orbits the military needed for their satellites, so the military just developed their own launch systems.  Which managed to kill ZERO people over the same timespan.

5e1bjb,"Why it's acceptable to eat meat or hunt certain animals but not animals that are considered typical pets? I don't mean to offend anyone and really want to understand the difference between meat versus pets.

I just want to understand how animals are categorized as food/hunt/pet and why someone is deeply hurt when a pet is hurt but animals that are killed for food/products or hunted are not a big deal. What causes a differing emotional connection to certain animals/situations?","It is a purely cultural distinction. People often cite domestication as proof that some animals are more 'pet'-like, but that is just evidence of a long-standing cultural distinction (and might have more to do with the way *humans* have been domesticated by our cultural beliefs, and - possibly - by biological processes).

Travelling to countries where people eat things that I did not consider to be *food* - cats, dogs, bugs, horrible Cthulhian nasties from the sea - I listened to many discussions about what is or isn't a pet and what is or isn't food, and nobody made a claim stronger than ""this is how it has always been done here"". Foreigners would often cite their emotional connections to pets, and how there was something inherently 'natural' dividing animals that should be pets and animals that should be food... but many of them disagreed about which animals went into which category.

In the US I have observed that many people don't really think of 'meat', as found in a grocery store, as being or coming from an 'animal', and numerous people have told me they eat meat, not animals. If the average person still lived with animals, still butchered their own meat, I suspect this weird abstraction could have never occurred. But what we eat and what we do to be able to eat are rarely connected by anything but money, for a lot of people.

(In the US when people find out I don't eat meat the responses range from polite interest to being seriously offended. I don't know why they get offended. I don't care what anyone else eats, I just don't eat meat when I have other options. Among the people who get seriously offended, many have tried to explain to me that there are 'natural' reasons to eat some animals, like cows. ""It's not like we're eating cats or dogs!"", which would apparently be 'unnatural'.)",eli5

3sx9gx,"Why doesn't Journalism use References? I don't get why its so normal for news publications to make claims based on synthesizing research without citing that research as one would in an academic paper.  Why do journalists report on new scientific or medical developments and usually never mention the actual scientific article that was published, often they don't even mention the name of the journal.","Much of journalistic style is designed to keep news articles short. Printing and paper used to be much more expensive than they are today, and since all the news was in print there were more pages to be printed. Additionally, since the first newspapers had text only, it was hard to read a long article, since there were no images to break it up. (And in the days of manual typesetting, you went easy on the subheadings, too.)

Hence the use of certain standard abbreviations, editing for a snappy read, and sticking to the important details developed. That's still the style used today. An article that doesn't mention its sources is bad, and certainly if it's about research it should mention the journal (a lot of articles about research are *really* bad; it's not usually something you put an experienced reporter on), but a long list of references just isn't part of the journalistic tradition.",eli5

7dsps9,Why does our star appear yellow but the other stars appear white?,"The Sun is actually white in color, maybe a tinge of red making it a pinkish white.

If you concentrate really hard, you can see that the star overhead, Vega, is clearly blue. Antares is red or orange.

All stars emit all colors of light. They appear colorful to us because of their temperature. The bigger the stars, the hotter they are, and appear more blue to us.

The reason most stars appear white to us is because we have two different kind of light sensors in our eyes. Rods and Cones.

Rods detect brightness, while Cones detect color. The cones are not very sensitive, so if a light is too dim they are not activated, and we perceive the color as white. So even a red star looks white if it is dim, and only brighter stars look like they have color.",eli5

59pop8,"What are the effects of venoms and antivenoms on blood? For example I've seen that blood can coagulate. In that case what would be the effect of the antivenom? To de-coagulate?

What are some other effects of venoms and the respective antivenoms?","It depends on the venom at hand. Let me give two examples:

1) Snakes (particularly Rattlesnakes) – their venom acts as a neurotoxin. In other words, it inhibits neural signals from being completed for voluntary and involuntary muscles. That is why one of the biggest signs that you are undergoing a neurotoxic attack is creeping numbness, difficulty breathing, and paralysis. These all happen because the venomous components (molecules) interfere with signaling molecules in your neural synapses and it causes muscles (limbs, lungs, heart, etc.) to just stop responding to your brain's signals.

2) Brown Recluse spider– Now in these guys, the venom acts differently because instead of blocking muscular function, it flat-out begins killing cells near or associated with the bite region. The flesh decomposes really badly (which can lead to septic shock down the line) in a process known as necrosis. This varies in action from direct lysis of your tissue cells to something like inhibiting gaseous (O2 < - > CO2) exchange. 

It really depends on the venom you are looking at. Each venomous bite has a different cocktail of chemicals that elicit different reactions from species to species.

As for antivenoms, they can behave just like you said. Their main modes of action is to either reverse the chemical reactions going on or to ""out compete"" the binding of venom with important molecules. An example with a synthetic ""venom"" - Sarin Gas. Sarin binds to a signal molecule and it locks the muscle by blocking these signals. Something like Pralidoxime is then used to bind to the signal instead of Sarin and it thus knocks off the blocking agent and allows the signal molecule to be recycled.

Edit: Added the antivenom bit and finished an incomplete thought.",eli5
3m8vs0,"Why did 3D tvs fail to make it to mainstream? Though I have some thoughts, I was wondering if you people had any.","Former game developer here,

I got to see this technology a few years before it went mainstream, the television manufacturers were all pushing hard for content producers (video game developers and TV show producers) to make stuff for this. They ran into the same problem Sega did 20 years ago...

Sega developed a 3D parallax game console, the same technology behind 3D televisions. What happens to your brain when you look at parallax television? Your brain isn't getting enough queues to interpret depth that it normally gets (2 queues out of 11) and goes ""fuck it"", and kind of gives up. Your brain suddenly is *not* doing a lot of the things it does to determine depth is normally does. So if you feel initially disoriented when looking at parallax and then you ""get used to it"", this is what's happening. Then you take the headset off and your brain takes some time to come back to reality. Up to several hours later.

Sega testers spent hours and hours staring at parallax, and they had quite a few fender bender accidents when they went home. So the executives recognized if parallax can have a lasting effect on adult brains, what would happen to a child, with their developing brains, whom they knew would spend even more time looking at parallax? No one was going to test this technology to see if it could permanently fuck up a kid and the consequences of that, and they weren't going to risk getting sued for permanently fucking people up, so they shit canned the whole thing.

And here again, with this new twist on an old technology, there are all sorts of reports of car accidents after going to see Avatar, and even one person, who had a brain defect and he couldn't see depth his whole life of 40-something years, his brain got fixed after watching the movie! Good for him, perhaps, but not something you want to have happen to you in an uncontrolled environment, stumbling out of a movie theater...

Further, there is a substantial loss of color quality for several technical reasons; to people whose job it is to develop a stunning visual, they don't want a loss of quality - parallax doesn't constitute a big enough return.

And then there's the cost. From a filming standpoint, you now need 2 cameras, and two data feeds, and twice the bandwidth, and they both have to be synchronized. That's a huge technological burden.

As far as a video game, that means we have to render the same scene twice. Due to processing overhead, each scene possesses less than half the quality of a single frame, and then throw color depth loss on top of it! The back step in graphic quality is unacceptable to the mass market; such a product would be niche for the novelty. And no one wants to invest in more than twice the processing hardware to accommodate for the loss, when that much hardware could make a single frame render look even more stunning!",eli5

3mogks,"Why are thousands of people worldwide joining ISIS? Especially women? Referencing this article from the news: _URL_0_
","Let's start with who these individuals are. The majority of foreign-born ISIS recruits come from Egypt, Jordan, Libya, and Tunisia. The vast majority are from middle class, secular families. Critically, most are not well versed in the Koran at all and are only casually observant Muslims.

Let me describe a fictional but realistic narrative.

Ahmed is a 24 year old engineering student from Alexandria, Egypt. He grew up in a comfortable, single family apartment with his parents and four siblings. His father works for a bank, and his mother teaches music at the local school.

Ahmed's family doesn't go to mosque every week, but they go on important holidays and consider themselves good Muslims. His whole life, Ahmed has been told that he must be a good Muslim, and the chief way that he will do this will be by marrying a good Muslim girl from a good family, probably chosen by his parents in consultation with members of his extended family.

But Ahmed has also been on the internet since he was 14. He watches hardcore pornography, listens to Western music, and reads a lot of blogs. When he talks about politics with his friends, it's with the bitter cynicism that characterizes the Arab world.

He looks at his father and is humiliated. Egyptians have never been free to choose their own leaders. His father has played by the rules, worked hard within the system, and he has relatively little to show for it. Ahmed himself has been unemployed his whole adult life; he's a good student, but there just aren't enough middle class jobs in Egypt.

Online he starts talking to a guy named Mahmoud who has some wild ideas. He tells Ahmed that he *should* be embarrassed of his father. His father, and the entire generation of Egyptian men he's a part of, have failed to live a righteous life, and have tolerated like sheep the injustices perpetrated on them by Egypt's secular regime. He points out to Ahmed that this regime will never give up power willingly, just look at the results of the Arab Spring, in which the military government pretended to cede power to democracy, only to snatch it back. He tells Ahmed that democracy, even Islamic democracy of the sort advocated by the Muslim Brotherhood, is merely a Western plot designed to keep Muslims weak and fighting each other. Only a righteous theocracy, a caliphate, can be strong enough to stand against the West when the great battle comes.

Mahmoud also tells Ahmed that the life he's preparing for, a life of struggling to find work, a life married to a boring, maybe homely girl not of his choosing, isn't the only one available to him. He can live a much more meaningful, exciting life that will also be far more righteous.

Ahmed, Mahmoud tells him, is living in the most important moment in history for Muslims, and God expects him to restore God's empire on earth. Ahmed hasn't read the Koran that carefully (it's in Classical Arabic, which is poorly understood by many modern Arabic speakers, like Ahmed, who haven't studied in religious schools), so when Mahmoud quotes it from memory to him, and explains the meaning in terms of his own radical ideology, Ahmed is impressed and finds him persuasive.

Mahmoud tells Ahmed that if he comes to the Islamic State, he can live the life of his dreams. He can shoot a gun like the guys in American rap videos he likes. He can fuck as many women as he likes, because according to Mahmoud the Koran allows a righteous Muslim man like him to take non-Muslim women as concubines. His sexual life needn't be confined to just one women as he's been told all his life; all of the fantasies he's had watching porn that he'd resigned himself to never realizing can now come true, and they don't make him any less righteous a Muslim.

Most importantly, though, Mahmoud tells Ahmed that he's important. That he matters. That despite his very average life so far, he's destined to be a famous and powerful warrior of God.

So when Mahmoud tells Ahmed during one of their Skype conversations that his friend Salman is going to be in Ahmed's neighborhood soon, Ahmed is excited to meet him. Salman has all the fiery conviction of Mahmoud. He laughs derisively at the lives of the sheep around them when they drink tea in a cafe together.

He chides the waiter at the cafe for his clean-shaven face, telling Ahmed that it's pathetic that Muslim men would ape the fashions and hairstyles of European non-believers. He mocks the skirt of the waitress to Ahmed, telling him that in the Islamic State, she would be flogged for wearing such whorish clothes, and maybe she'd even be given to Ahmed as a concubine for him to ""instruct"" in the ways of being a good Muslim wife. This notion excites Ahmed, especially when Salman assures him that this is not only acceptable but demanded in God's eyes.

So when Salman returns a few days later with a fake passport with Ahmed's picture that will allow him to travel to Turkey, and from Turkey into Syria. Ahmed decides this is his moment. The picture of the Yazidi girl that Salman promises Ahmed will be his first bride doesn't hurt either.

Of course, life in Syria is not what Ahmed expected. There is no Yazidi bride, for one. For another, he is not commanding God's armies in battle, as he had in the fantasies Mahmoud and Salman had painted for him. He's the lowest of the low, constantly subjected to physical abuse by his superiors. He has no patron here. Salman and Mahmoud are gone, and Ahmed is sent into battle again and again until after six weeks in Syria he and the rest of his unit are killed by in an ambush by Kurdish fighters.

••••

This story ended up being longer than I expected, but I wanted to rebut two common misconceptions, chiefly that ISIS recruits:

a) are deeply religious individuals consumed by faith. They are not. Most are poorly versed in Koranic Arabic and have had only casually religious upbringings. It is precisely this relative lack of knowledge that makes them vulnerable to the recruiters (who know the Koran *very* well).

b) are isolated from Western culture. They are not, which is why ISIS propaganda videos look like well-produced rap videos or action movie trailers. They are developed to appeal to young people who grew up watching music videos on YouTube and American action movies on DVDs with their friends.

This story is just one narrative. It is one that characterizes the experience of a lot of ISIS's *foreign recruits from Arab countries*. It does not describe the experience of Iraqi or Syrian ISIS members, nor does it describe the experience of most European or American-raised ISIS recruits, although it may not be too far off for some.

Source: I'm a graduate student in security studies who's done a lot of (non-original) research on violent extremism and national and transnational efforts to fight it. I've also recently returned from living in Egypt.

**EDIT:** Thanks, someone, for the gold! I cleaned up a few typos, and I wanted to add one more point:

I don't have an answer. My story was purely descriptive, not prescriptive. What if Ahmed survived the ambush, and managed to flee across the border back into Turkey. He might make it back to Egypt, but then what? His parents know where he's been. They might be ashamed of him, even terrified of him. Or they might view him as a victim of brainwashing, and want to help him.

But what do we as societies do? Do we treat him as a terrorist and a criminal and lock him up for life? Do we treat him as a surrendering soldier in war, and lock him up until the war ends? Will the war ever end? Do we treat him as part victim, part perpetrator, and try to rehabilitate him? Will that work?

I don't have answers to these questions, and as far as I can tell many of those making these decisions don't either. But I think these are questions we need to ask.",eli5

There's countless things people buy that you can't just simply say ""is X  >  Y?"" and get a straight answer about.

If you're looking at cars, there's all sorts of factors: looks, speed, acceleration, towing capacity, fuel efficiency, interior space, interior luxury, safety, brand loyalty, etc. etc. etc.

If you're buying houses, the differences are even greater.

You want to invest in the stock market?  Good luck even getting the experts to agree on what something is worth, let alone whether something is a ""better deal"" than something else.

Insurance isn't just one single thing - it's a list of dozens, if not hundreds, of separate things that may or may not be covered, coupled with hundreds of separate contracts w/ different providers who may or may not accept that coverage.  Then you have multiple different *types* of plans (HMOs, PPOs, etc.).  Finally, you have different companies with different levels of customer service, profit margins and whatnot.

9f6uhw,"If the sun is closest to the earth during winter, why does it get colder out?","If it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer in the southern hemisphere. So the Earth is both 'closest' and 'furthest' during winter, depending on where you are.

Simply put, the change in distance is very minor, a few million miles out of ~93 million miles. This results in something like a maximum of around 10% change in energy delivered.

The real culprit is the angle at which the light strikes the Earth.

Consider pointing a flash light at the wall. Your flashlight delivers 10 oomphs of power to that wall. If you point it right at the wall, what is it delivered as? A circle.

Now if you tilt your flashlight, what happens? The circle spreads out to cover a wider area right, becoming an oval? But the flashlight hasn't been rebuilt, so it still just delivers 10 oomphs. So if 10 oomphs are delivered to a larger area, what does that mean? It means each 'square foot' of area is getting less oomph. 

This is what happens on Earth. We are [tilted](_URL_0_), such that one pole is roughly pointed towards the sun, and one away. The hemisphere tilted towards the sun get more direct light (more oomph, the flashlight is pointed right at it) and the hemisphere tilted away gets less direct light (less oomph, the flashlight is tilted away). This easily overpowers the small change from distance. 

That oomph goes directly into heating the surface, which in turn heats the air above it.",eli5

1m4chx,"What is cold, why and how do particles get 'cold' I've been wondering about this for a while but all I really have to help me is a B grade in GCSE physics so I don't really understand this particular idea of particles getting colder and warmer. ","Cold is simply the lack of thermal energy. What is thermal energy?

Imagine a tennis ball bouncing around a room, with no gravity and no atmosphere to slow it down.

Now imagine a second tennis ball, bouncing around that room at a much slower speed, in the same room. When the two eventually collide, the faster one will slow down, and the slower one will speed up.

If those were molecules, the faster one would be the 'hotter' one, and the slower would be the 'colder' one, and when they impacted, heat would transfer from one to the other.

Now, say you have a room with a bunch of tennis balls bouncing around, and imagine you made that room smaller. Well, the same number of bounces are happening on the walls (Which also have thermal energy) but those bounces are happening in a smaller area, so that area becomes hotter from getting hit more often, because getting hit more often transfers more energy to the wall. If you make the room bigger, it gets colder, because it's getting hit less often. That's why when you compress a gas it gets hotter, and when you expand a gas it  gets colder.",eli5

41kvhe,Why would somebody sue the gun manufacturer after a mass shooting? Unless the gun manufacturer sold the weapons to a known criminal how in anyway are they liable for what some crazy would do? You wouldn't sue Budwieser or ford if a drunk driver hit you. So why would you sue the manufacturer  of a gun if some crazy used it?,"You have the right of it with your mindset.  Unfortunately, in the 1990s and early 2000's, anti-gun groups filed tons of law suits against the gun manufacturers and retailers on behalf of gun violence victims, with the express purpose to try and bankrupt the manufacturers and retailers.

Even knowing they wouldn't win the suits, they kept piling them up, one after another, after another, to make the manufacturers and retailers lose money paying for lawyers, expert testimony, investigative staff, and the like.

That is the reason the Gun Manufacturer and Retailer law went into place, to block these frivolous law suits.  The lawsuits bankrupted small retailers, and made the potential cost of entering the gun manufacturing business too high to be worth it unless you were already a huge company.

Many people on here are trying to justify it, by saying things like ""it will make them act more responsibly"" and so on, but the truth is, the manufacturers are already acting responsibly.  They do not sell to individuals in almost all cases, only to retailers, who are licensed dealers or wholesellers.  They make their items to meet all standards and regulations.  If they don't meet standards and regulations, they can be sued for negligence, as any other business can.

Retailers are where it gets a little more dicey.  People want to be able to blame them for selling a person a gun if that gun is later used in a crime.  The issue is, if the retailer did everything by the book, did the background check, and so on, then they legally shouldn't be held responsible.  If they didn't do their jobs, then the law shielding them from a lawsuit doesn't protect them, and they can be taken down by the ATF for failure to follow the law.",eli5

56k0n8,"why does the outlier exist in many languages that the number 11-19 follow a different pattern of construction that doesn't fall in line with 21-29, 31-39 and etc?","> Like 11-19 aren't said Onety-one, onety-two, onety-three and so forth

11-19 *do* follow the same pattern of construction, it's just the order that isn't quite the same. The suffix '-teen' comes from the same etymological root as 'ten'; 'teen' means 'ten'. 'Thirteen' quite literally just means ""three (and) ten"". Fourteen = ""four (and) ten"", fifteen = ""five (and) ten"", etc. It's more obvious in languages closely related to English, like Dutch, where spelling and pronunciation of ten/teen haven't diverged. In Dutch, 10 = 'tien'; 13 = 'dertien', 14 = 'veertien', and so on.

Okay, so that takes care of 13-19, but what about 11 and 12 you ask? As best anyone can surmise, eleven comes from a Proto-Germanic word meaning ""ten-and-one-left-over"". Twelve similarly meaning ""ten-and-two-left-over"". Again, Germanic languages closely related to English have similar names for these numbers. In Dutch it's 'elf' and 'twaalf'. In German it's 'elf' and 'zwölf'. In Icelandic is 'ellefu' and 'tólf'.

Why do we not say 'onety'? Because where do you think the '-ty' suffix comes from? What do you think it means? Sound it out. '-ty'... 'tee'... tee*n*... *ten*... Etymologically, '-ty' just means 'tens'. ""Onety"" would hypothetically just mean ""one ten""; it's superfluous. Twenty = ""two tens"". Thirty = ""three tens"". Forty-one = ""four-tens(-and)-one"".",eli5

1) Moisture: some foods taste best when really dry.  Leaving them sit in room air, the moisture in the air enters into the food.  French fries, for example, are ""dry"" when fresh because the deep frying dries out the potatoes, making them crispy.  When moisture re-enters the food, it becomes stale and soggy.

2) Bacteria: there's bacteria in the air and in the food.  If it sits, the bacteria has a chance to grow, altering the food.

3) Chemical reaction: when some foods are exposed to oxygen, it creates a chemical reaction that alters the food.",eli5

1mit25,"Why do humans exhibit fanaticism? Whether its religion, Playstation, ethnicity, ""Reppin the 401"", loving the Ravens, etc. Why do we love picking a side? ","The concept is linked with [In-group favortism](_URL_0_).  Basically, humans are social creatures.  They naturally want to be part of a group that works towards a common goal.  This is the In-Group.  Other groups that might be competing for the same goal (the Out-Groups) will be viewed very unfavorably, sometimes even violently.  Because this aspect is fairly critical to human survival, humans form groups fairly easily.  It doesn't actually matter how the groups are formed (they could be completely chosen at random), so just getting a group of people together that agree on a single thing (we all like this style of music, buy this type of phone, like this local sports team, etc), and they will start to identify as an In-Group.  The negative view of the Out-Group will also apply here (disliking someone because of the music they like, the phone they buy, the sports team they support).  Since this social interaction is so critical to our survival in actual survival situations, it carries over into the more trivial social interaction we have.

l8dsx,"Why is making a nuclear bomb so hard? Why is it so hard, i have searched the internet and cant find anything, useful?","There are two designs of nuclear bombs, gun and implosion. Gun design bombs are actually very simple, its basically two lumps of uranium which are fired into each other using a gun-like mechanism. Nuclear explosions happen when you reach what is called ""critical mass"". Basically that means there's enough uranium packed into a small enough space that it can react with itself, causing a chain reaction and explosion. The gun design has half-sphere lumps which are approximately half-critical mass, then it fires them together so that it makes one critical mass lump.

The second type are more complicated, basically you have a sphere of uranium which has explosives all around it. The explosives have to be very carefully designed in order in compress the sphere equally all around as they explode. These are called shaped charges and were one of the difficulties in making bombs work well. The implosion design is more potent when it goes off correctly, so all modern bombs are designed liked that. But as you can imagine making hundreds of explosions all go off perfectly in sync is really difficult. This design works by compressing the single lump of uranium that is too big spread out to be critical mass, into a smaller more compressed lump that is critical mass. But obviously it has to be compressed in the correct way otherwise things go wrong.

But this ignores the main difficulty which is actually getting the uranium. Most normal uranium out of the ground is U238, 99.3% in fact. However to make a bomb you need uranium that's mostly made out of U235 (around 0.7% in the ground, and you need to make it around 80% usually to be weapons grade).

Filtering out the 238 to leave only 235 is called enrichment and is a complicated thing. The first technique that was used in the Manhattan project was called ""electromagnetic separation"". In this you take natural uranium and vaporise it, then you ionise it (which means basically give it an electromagnetic charge). Then you pass that ionised uranium vapour through a magnetic field and the magnetic field bends the path of the U235 slightly more than it does the U238. You can use that to capture the U235 in its separate path. The machines to do this were called ""Calutrons"", most of the U235 that went into the Hiroshima bomb was made with this technique, but even with dozens of these massive machines running it still took several years to make enough uranium for one bomb. They were not very efficient.

A more modern uranium enrichment process is called Gaseous diffusion, in this you make the gas compound uranium hexafluoride by mixing natural uranium with fluoride. And force it through a semi-permeable membrane made of Telfon, when you do this the lighter U235 moves faster through the membrane than the heavier U238, so you can separate it out that way. The real difficulty of this method is finding a material that's semi-permeable, but isn't corroded by the very corrosive uranium hexafluoride.

Another modern technique are gas centrifuges. Basically you use the same uranium hexafluoride, but spin it very very fast in tubes, The heavier U238 goes to the outer parts of the tube so you can filter that off. However you have to spin these things super fast like 90-100,000 rpm. So the main difficulty here is making a tube that can withstand such massive speeds without tearing itself apart. Proper centrifuges are made out of maraging steel, which is this super high strength steel, and those can go the crazy speeds I mentioned above. Gas centrifuges are the most common technique nowadays, and you'll often read articles about Iran, etc having centrifuges. Its very hard to make such perfect tubes so massively strong without maraging steel, and maraging steel is heavily monitored for international trade, so Iran has had to use aluminium tubes. These aluminium tubes are not nearly as good, so you can can't spin them as fast, which means they're much less efficient. So much so that even with the hundreds of centrifuges Iran has it'll take them a year or two to make enough U235 for one bomb rather than weeks/months with more high tech ones.

I've also neglected to mention plutonium here, so briefly: There's a second material you can use to make bombs, plutonium, specifically Pu239. Now plutonium doesn't really exist in nature, so you have to make it. And you make it inside nuclear reactors. By exposing U238 to neutron radiation inside a nuclear reactor you can turn it into Plutonium. However like Uranium there are two main kinds, Pu239, which is the stuff you want for bombs, and Pu240 which contaminates the Pu239 and causes bombs made out of it to ""fizzle"" if there's too much 240. So in order to keep the levels of Pu240 low you have to expose your uranium to the radiation only for relatively short periods of time. For this you basically need to design a nuclear reactor that allows you to frequently take out the old fuel and put new fuel in without having to shut down the whole reactor. It's for this reason that certain countries civilian nuclear power programmes are looked upon with suspicion. Certain designs allow this kind of rapid refuelling whilst other ones don't. Anyway the second bomb that hit Nagasaki was made using plutonium.

The darkness appears in my peripheral first, and the longer I stare at something, the farther it advances until it seems that there is something obscuring my vision, but if I move my eyes at all, everything goes back to normal. What gives?","It has to do with the placing of ""rods"" and ""cones"" in your eye. Basically, rods and cones are the two types of photo-receptors in your eye (photo-receptors = the microscopic bits that detect light and send the info toward your brain).

Cones are found mainly in the ""fovea,"" or the part of your eye right in the middle that you use to focus on something. There are three types of cones that each detect one of the three primary colors: Red (long cones), Green (Medium cones), and Blue (Short cones). Cones work best with bright light and help you to see vivid colors and detail.

Rod cells are more common in the sides of your eye. They aren't so great at distinguishing quick changes or telling color, but they respond very well to dim light and help you see at night. 

So, to answer your question, when you stare straight at something with tunnel vision, you're relying on cones to send the info to the brain. Since cones don't do so well in the dark, you begin to see less. A fun experiment to demonstrate this effect is to find a very dim star in the night sky. When you look straight at it, it will disappear! You can only see it out of the corner of your eye.",eli5

61szcv,why are birds way better at avoiding cars than other animals? ,"The best way to explain this would be to say that they perceive time on a more contracted scale, at least where visual input is concerned. A large part of any bird's brain is dedicated to vision, which makes sense when you consider how delicate they can be while in flight, the need to fly in close formation with other birds, hunting, mating, etc. 

To them, a car is a *huge* and obvious obstacle which they instinctively avoid, unless something unusual happens, or the bird messes up (which they sometimes, but rarely, do). A sudden downdraft can kill a bird, but it won't just fail to see a car coming and fail to avoid it. 

In terms of other animals... other animals have to live on the ground, they can't fly, and as a result they can't escape the need to cross roads. By contrast however, unlike birds, they're not killed by the millions by wind turbines.",eli5

3kozx7,Why do so many people in UK Labour think Jeremy Corbyn will destroy the party? ,"Essentially because they think his political views are too extreme for voters (and too extreme for many in the Labour Party) and about three decades out of date.

The trouble is, they may have a point. Corbyn's policies are those of the Labour Party that lost to Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979; Labour then lost the next three elections until Tony Blair became leader and refashioned the party (so called ""New Labour""). Labour then won the next three elections until Gordon Brown took over and tried to move the party back to its more traditional roots, whereupon Labour lost two elections, bringing us up to the present day.

Corbyn has made it very clear that he wants to return the party very much to what it was in the 1980s, which his critics say will make Labour unelectable (as it was in the 1980s). In fact, many in the Conservative Party hoped Corbyn would win for precisely this reason.

On the other hand, one thing even Corbyn's critics are prepared to accept is that he does sound like a genuine conviction politician, not like the three candidates he was up against, all of whom avoided too many contentious issues, gave typical evasive answers to questions and generally spoke in clichés and soundbites. Corbyn is also very popular with his contituents, whom he has represented continually since 1983.",eli5

Now there are also renegade strands of hair, e.g. hair on moles, and I'm assuming you meant hairs like those? 

On moles it's usually because of the increased pigmentation from the mole, but stray hairs like those where there aren't any moles is usually the result of the hair base being deeper down into the skin.

We can do all of these things. Underwater structures exist. Hydro-power exists, and desalination exists. There's not a particularly large base of people clamoring to live under the sea however, so the market doesn't really exist.

3oj502,Why is depression so common despite it being counterproductive to survival? ,"One reason to suspect that depression is an adaptation, not a malfunction, comes from research into a molecule in the brain known as the 5HT1A receptor. The 5HT1A receptor binds to serotonin, another brain molecule that is highly implicated in depression and is the target of most current antidepressant medications. Rodents lacking this receptor show fewer depressive symptoms in response to stress, which suggests that it is somehow involved in promoting depression. (Pharmaceutical companies, in fact, are designing the next generation of antidepressant medications to target this receptor.) When scientists have compared the composition of the functional part of the rat 5HT1A receptor to that of humans, it is 99 percent similar, which suggests that it is so important that natural selection has preserved it. The ability to “turn on” depression would seem to be important, then, not an accident.

This is not to say that depression is not a problem. Depressed people often have trouble performing everyday activities, they can’t concentrate on their work, they tend to socially isolate themselves, they are lethargic, and they often lose the ability to take pleasure from such activities such as eating and sex. Some can plunge into severe, lengthy, and even life-threatening bouts of depression.

So what could be so useful about depression? Depressed people often think intensely about their problems. These thoughts are called ruminations; they are persistent and depressed people have difficulty thinking about anything else. Numerous studies have also shown that this thinking style is often highly analytical. They dwell on a complex problem, breaking it down into smaller components, which are considered one at a time.

This analytical style of thought, of course, can be very productive. Each component is not as difficult, so the problem becomes more tractable. Indeed, when you are faced with a difficult problem, such as a math problem, feeling depressed is often a useful response that may help you analyze and solve it. For instance, in some of our research, we have found evidence that people who get more depressed while they are working on complex problems in an intelligence test tend to score higher on the test.

Analysis requires a lot of uninterrupted thought, and depression coordinates many changes in the body to help people analyze their problems without getting distracted. In a region of the brain known as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), neurons must fire continuously for people to avoid being distracted. But this is very energetically demanding for VLPFC neurons, just as a car’s engine eats up fuel when going up a mountain road. Moreover, continuous firing can cause neurons to break down, just as the car’s engine is more likely to break down when stressed. Studies of depression in rats show that the 5HT1A receptor is involved in supplying neurons with the fuel they need to fire, as well as preventing them from breaking down. These important processes allow depressive rumination to continue uninterrupted with minimal neuronal damage, which may explain why the 5HT1A receptor is so evolutionarily important.

Many other symptoms of depression make sense in light of the idea that analysis must be uninterrupted. The desire for social isolation, for instance, helps the depressed person avoid situations that would require thinking about other things. Similarly, the inability to derive pleasure from sex or other activities prevents the depressed person from engaging in activities that could distract him or her from the problem. Even the loss of appetite often seen in depression could be viewed as promoting analysis because chewing and other oral activity interferes with the brain’s ability to process information.

But is there any evidence that depression is useful in analyzing complex problems? For one thing, if depressive rumination were harmful, as most clinicians and researchers assume, then bouts of depression should be slower to resolve when people are given interventions that encourage rumination, such as having them write about their strongest thoughts and feelings. However, the opposite appears to be true. Several studies have found that expressive writing promotes quicker resolution of depression, and they suggest that this is because depressed people gain insight into their problems.

There is another suggestive line of evidence. Various studies have found that people in depressed mood states are better at solving social dilemmas. Yet these would seem to have been precisely the kind of problems difficult enough to require analysis and important enough to drive the evolution of such a costly emotion. Consider a woman with young children who discovers her husband is having an affair. Is the wife’s best strategy to ignore it, or force him to choose between her and the other woman, and risk abandonment? Laboratory experiments indicate that depressed people are better at solving social dilemmas by better analysis of the costs and benefits of the different options that they might take.

2itdvd,"why voter ID laws are racist Isn't it illegal not to have ID on you?

Sounds like BS. My ID is required for EVERYTHING else ","Law grad here. 

Whether or not the ID laws are racist depends on your perspective. Generally speaking, there are two kids of discrimination in policy: Adverse impact and disparate treatment. The former is a facially neutral policy that just so happens to affect a certain group worse than others. The latter is a policy intended to treat a group different than others. 

Which category ID laws falls into depends on intent. If created with the intent of securing the voting process, they would be considered adverse impact. From what I've read, minorities are less likely to have a driver's license or other forms of government-issued ID. If you believe that lawmakers are using them to disenfranchise minorities, that is disparate treatment. 

As a final note, I'll throw in my view. Asking for an ID is a reasonable requirement to vote. It is constitutional. As you pointed out, many things less important than voting require you to present ID. However, in-person voter fraud is relatively rare, and very unlikely to influence anything besides a local election.",eli5

It stands in opposition to various forms of political idealism, which can be ""we are the good guys, so we must not do evil things"" or ""we are the good guys, we don't negotiate with the bad guys"". Realpolitik says ""we will do evil things if we have to. We will negotiate with the bad guys if that's what it takes. All that matters is that we achieve our goals."" In Cold War terms, it boiled down to ""We will do whatever it takes to defeat the Soviets and win the Cold War.""

Kissinger's guiding philosophy was to do whatever benefitted the United States, regardless of past US policy or the politics of whomever he was supporting/hurting. The most prominent action taken by Kissinger was opening up diplomatic relations with China, a Communist country. This violated the anti-Communist ideals the US had espoused for decades. But it also opened up a new and giant trading partner for the US, and helped to politically isolate the USSR, the US's greatest foe. Thus Kissinger violated the country's deeply held ideals in order to benefit the country.

Similarly, he violated the US ideal of support for Israel at all costs, when he advised the Israelis to give back conqured Egyptian territory as part of negotiations after the Yom Kippur War. This move warmed relations between the two countries, eventually leading to the Camp David Accords and the recognition of Israel by Egypt.

On the flipside, he violated more US ideals than just anti-Communism or pro-Israelism. In order to maintain US alliances and power around the world, he supported a number of dictators and genocidal governments. He supported the Pakistani government when it was committing genocide against Bangladesh, because Pakistan and China were US-aligned and Bangladesh was USSR-aligned. He supported the genocidal Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, because they were at odds with the USSR-aligned North Vietnamese. Most famously, he supported the overthrow of USSR-aligned Socialist Salvador Allende in Chile by brutal dictator Augusto Pinochet. All of these actions were beneficial to the US in terms of geopolitical power, but were appalling from a humanitarian perspective.

Basically it comes down to a philosophical question: Kissinger kept the ""good guys"" in power. But he did so using methods that cast doubt on the US even being the ""good guys"" at all. Was that worth it? His critics, including many redditors, say no.",eli5

2wf0sh,"Why can I not buy a Toyota Hilux in the USA? I served my country proudly in 2009 and 2011. Much of  that time was spent either behind the wheel of, or standing behind a turret in the bed of, a Toyota Hilux 4x4. I am personally not a fan of Toyota in general  (I own a GMC 4x4 and work for an international Honda manufacturing supplier) but the Hilux has a special place in my heart. This truck has proven to the world that it is capable and dependable. It worked hard to see me to my destinations and shield me from the elements. I want one... desperately, but apparently expensive chickens make it impossible for me to own a Hilux badged Toyota in the U.S.... why?","The Hilux is first and foremost a commercial vehicle. It was sold here in the states as the ""Toyota Truck"" until the company decided to design a new truck, the Tacoma, aimed at North American tastes. Since trucks are used as personal vehicles here, they wanted something that was more comfortable and spacious, and since people tow more here, emphasis was put more toward that than hauling capacity. It may not have the legendary durability of the Hi-Lux, but it's a better fit for what people use trucks for here, and that means more sales.

As for chickens? France and West Germany raised tariffs on imported chickens in the early 60's, so America retaliated by raising tariffs on brandy, trucks, and a few other things. Eventually, these tariffs were all lifted except the one on trucks to protect the domestic market. This led to Japanese trucks being ""manufactured"" here by bolting on the beds at the port. More recently, Ford imported Transit Connect vans until they were sure enough of its success to start domestic production. These vans were all wagon models so they could be classified as passenger vehicles. To sell cargo versions, they simply removed the seats and interior after they reached U.S. shores.",eli5

Guys like Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and Tyson are gone.  The Klitschkos reigned for most of the past 10-15 years and they refused to fight each other.  With Two guys pretty much dominating and refusing to fight each other, no one else stood out.  There is no division for them to move up like happened to Pacquiao or Mayweather.  Those two just kind of stayed and beat everyone constantly so it wasn't exciting.

Something like Pacquaio can be great, but still excitement by moving up a weight class.  It's a whole new level of top guys he hasn't faced, so everything is shiny and new to see how well he does.

So the answer is basically that the heavyweight scene stagnated and people shifted to lower weight classes.

cbozix,Why do magnets work better when they're cold? ,"Permanent magnets are the product of some carefully aligned bits within the substance.

First, individual atoms near each other have to line up so their magnetic moments are aligned. If they aren't aligned, the moment of one atom will cancel any in the opposite direction so the overall effect is that there is no overall magnetic field. Those atoms form groups called *domains*, which each have their own magnetic moment. Again, if the domains aren't aligned, they cancel each other out and the whole piece does not have a magnetic field.

When the substance is cold, the atoms and the domains are frozen in place. If they're already aligned, they stay that way. If the substance is heated, the atoms start bouncing around more, which gives them chances to reorient and fall out of alignment with the atoms next to each other. Eventually, all that random bouncing makes the atoms end up with random orientations towards each other, which means their magnetic moments aren't aligned and cancel each other out.",eli5

Alternatively, your head is filled with much more delicate blood vessels, not only because it's not conditioned to have to fight gravity, but also so that the barrier between your brain and your blood is much thinner to allow for faster extraction of oxygen and nutrients from your blood.

The sensation of ""blood rushing to your head"" is because your vessels are experiencing higher than normal pressure in your head while upside down and it's expanding the vessels, and in turn, applying pressure to your nerves. Likewise, your brain is in a bone cage and has no where to expand. The more blood in your brain, the more pressure builds in your skull, and you feel it.",eli5

1jo9rs,"Why is the India/Pakistan border the most militarized place on earth? Is it really only about religion?  Also, given that both of these nations are
nuclear powers, what is the likelihood of war between the two? ","When the British pulled out of the part of their empire which they called ""India"" in 1947, the area they had previously governed was divided up into several countries. In particular the northwest and northeast became a separate country (at the time both called Pakistan, later the eastern part of Pakistan became independent and called itself Bangladesh).

At the time of partition the area to become (West) Pakistan was by no means exclusively populated by Muslims, neither was the rest of India exclusively Hindu/Sikh. In fact in the months following partition, anything between 12 - 25 million people either voluntarily or forcibly moved their homes, often thousands of miles, to end up in the other country. Addtionally law and order broke down across much of the region, and many people (possibly as many as a million) died in riots and sectarian massacres.

So what the above means is that even at their very birth, India and Pakistan were in a state of antagonism to each other's existence. What's more a major political controversy existed over the State of Kashmir, which had a Muslim majority of its population but a Hindu ruler and had been declared part of India.

In the years since partition there have been four proper wars between India and Pakistan: in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. So as with any two countries which share a land border but are otherwise largely antagonistic to each other, both sides maintain a large military force close to the border, as neither trusts the other not to invade.

A nuclear war between the two is unlikely. India has a declared ""no first strike"" rule for its nuclear weapons and Pakistan has a similar ""weapon only of last resort"" status for its nuclear arsenal. What's more, with China bordering both countries, and Russia, the USA, and the United Kingdom all having strong political and economic interests in the region, it's likely that in the event of another outbreak of war the world would do its utmost to ensure a non-nuclear conflict.",eli5

It also involves violating another nation's sovereignty and destroying infrastructure in the country where the war is occurring. 

I don't know what you mean by cyber war, so I can't say why a government would choose that over a physical war. Most of the time cyber warfare describes one nation hacking another nation's computers in order to cause damage or disruption in the target nation. That's helpful to do to your adversary because it damages them and it may get you valuable intelligence, but it's not a replacement for physical war because it doesn't let you control any territory or force political changes.

216f91,Why tanks and other military vehicles occasionally fire depleted uranium shells. ,"The amount of damage a projectile can be is relative to its mass and its speed. For example, a pingpong ball doesn't have much mass, but it still can destroy a pingpong bat when it goes fast enough (See _URL_0_).

The speed of a projectile is relative to the mass of the projectile, the length of the barrel of the tank and the explosion to send off the projectile. If you know these three, you can predict how much damage it does do at a certain distance and thus how thick the armour needs to be to be protected from it. (I saw some documentary years ago that the French used anti-aircraft guns to defeat German tanks because their anti-tank guns couldn't penetrate the armour).

Depleted uranium is about 68% denser than lead, which means that it has a higher capacity to penetrate the armour.

But that is not all:
Depleted uranium is self-sharpening and pyrophoric. On impact with a hard target, such as an armored vehicle, the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp, giving it a higher penetration power. The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its pyrophoric properties. When a depleted uranium penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle it catches fire, often igniting ammunition and fuel, killing the crew and possibly causing the vehicle to explode.

86rspm,"If most of China's debt is state-owned, then what happens if the state just absolves itself of the debt?","Aight, basic class in economics, let’s go!

People pay taxes to governments, right. Why is it that way? So governments can provide in public infrastructure, social support and all the services they provide to the public. Often this is considered as an investment. Public spending leads to increased economic activity and prosperity which in turns leads to additional tax revenue, and so on.

Often public spending, in the form of investments, are expensive. For example, the construction of a large bridge or airport are an easy example to consider. The additional revenues these assets generate for the government are not always directly noticeably, but they come in the form of tax revenue as a result of increased economic activity. But just as any other investment, you’ll need a large down payment to finance the construction of this asset. The same principle applies to all other services governments provide to the public. 

To finance these downpayment, governments often get a loan, as the budget they have, may not cover large investment that foster prosperity. How do they get these loans? Often they publish bonds/obligations. Buyers of the bonds give their money to the government in exchange for the bond. The government commits to paying you a yearly interest as means of compensation for you not being able to use your money for other stuff (for risky countries (e.g. Greece) this interest rate is higher than for stable countries (e.g. Germany) to compensate for the risk that this country may never be able to pay you). At the end of the duration of the bond, legit governments pay you back the face value of your bond, as with common back loans.

Alright, so the chinese government engaged in a shitload of loans to finance its economic activities and growth. Banks, me, possibly your grandmother and your friends, we all bought the bonds. The chinese government has the obligation to pay us back. 

1) let’s say they pay us back. Everyone happy! Banks, you and me, we all received our money. Chinese government is happy since they had the money to finance growth or do other government stuff

2) let’s say they don’t pay us back. Your grandmother and your friends won’t be happy and will never buy bonds from the chinese government again, or will be very reluctant to do so. Even worse, banks (public or not) and corporates (state owned or not) that equally bought these bonds do not receive money to fulfill their obligations and go bankrupt. They most likely had obligations themselves. And in turn, their creditors don’t receive their money. This water fall effect in turn leads to other banks and debtors to bail and the country goes into a financial crisis. What’s the result? A) the aimed economic growth was not achieved B) nobody, either your friends, me or banks will ever want to buy bonds from the chinese government, which will not benefit the country.

Soooo, yes, the chinese government could just decide not to pay. But it would be a very bad idea!",eli5

1ndcly,"Why is GNU Hurd development taking so long, while the Linux kernel reached maturity/usability fairly quickly? ","There's not one single answer, but a combination of different factors, which I'll explain:
(1) Linux sucking the air out of the room
(2) OSs becoming commodities
(3) Poor performance tradeoffs in Hurd's design
(4) Uncompromising stance of the FSF

At the time when GNU Hurd was being developed, most of the interest was on Linux.  So if you were a developer who was interested in operating-system level work, you probably worked (or tried to work) on the Linux kernel.  This meant that there was good technical documentation and a community around the linux kernel, where there wasn't anything nearly as good equivalent around Hurd.

Now at the same time, even as Linux was getting really good, operating systems were starting to become commodities.  Fewer developers work on OS level code these days, and more work on things like dynamic web applications.  In the 1970s and 1980s, there were many aspects of OSs that needed drastic improvement; there was much research, and much code writing.  Development of OSs continues obviously today, but there's less focus on it in the Computer Science research world.  Why less focus?  Well first because the ones we have are really, really good, and second there may be a feeling that we understand very well the tradeoffs that go into OS design, and there's not as much un-tilled ground there.

Hurd represents a microkernel design, related to/based on the Mach microkernel.  That microkernel [has some problems](_URL_0_).  It's fair to say that this overall OS design (which Hurd adopted) favors parallelism, which is great, if parallelism is what your software needs.   Such a large performance penalty for generic workloads isn't worth great specialization for paralellism.  The only people who'd be willing to go for that I think are those who have parallel tasks all day every day.  They're out there, but they're not a significant portion of the computing base.

Finally, the position of the FSF -- the Hurd is closely aligned with the FSF, while Linux just uses the GPL and doesn't have anywhere near as many formal ties.  Linux was successful because of a ""big tent"" approach.  If you disagreed about the philosophical aspects of free software, you could still hack on Linux, you just GPL'd your code.   As far as the FSF is concerned, if you disagree with the philosophical stances on free software, you are wrong and an active agent in destroying hacker culture.   That perspective does not foster participation, it fosters dogma.  As a result, free software hackers would likely only gravitate to hard-core FSF projects if they had already accepted the dogma.   If you just wanted to write free software, but didn't have an opinion about the computing issues of the day, it's just easier to work on Linux.",eli5

4opyca,How does nicotine affect a body's dopamine level? ,"There's really a ton of misinformation about this. 

People will tell you that nicotine releases dopamine because it's pleasurable, or it's pleasurable because it releases dopamine, but neither of those is very accurate at all.

First off, there is no such thing as your ""dopamine level"". Neurotransmitters are not like hormones. Hormones get released into your body's general circulation, and if there's more testosterone (for example) in your system, then testosterone receptors throughout your body will get stimulated more.

But with neurotransmitters, one group of neurons can be using neurotransmitter X to send a particular message to some other group of neurons, and a different group of neurons (even in the same area) could be using the same neurotransmitter to communicate with some other group of neurons about something completely different.

As for nicotine:

Nicotine blocks nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter, and nicotinic ACh receptors are a subtype of that receptor, which is also present in most of your muscles). 

ONE of the systems in your brain that uses dopamine, the mesolimbic system, is related to motivation / goal directed behavior (this is often misrepresented as being a ""reward system"" but that's quite wrong). This is often called a dopaminergic system, but that is still misleading, because only a small part of the system is dopaminergic. As with most neural circuits, it's composed of many different groups of neurons that send signals to each other using various neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and others. 

Some parts of the system have nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and nicotine affects these.

ELI5:

There are systems in your brain that help govern goal directed behavior. A small part of one of these systems is dopaminergic, but most of it uses other neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine. Nicotine blocks acetylcholine receptors, changing the behavior of the system.",eli5

2lge14,Why do some people get rid of their (foreign language) accents so much more easily than others? ,"Our accents are engraved into our brains from as early as 6 months of age, Smithsonian Magazine reported. The baby begins to draw a map of the sounds he hears, and “that map continues to develop and strengthen as the sounds are repeated … until eventually they are almost ineradicable,” Patricia Kuhl, director of the Center for Mind, Brain, and Learning at the University of Washington, explained to the online publication. At some point, we lose the ability to make certain sounds and, eventually, we lose the ability to even hear them, io9 reported. Thankfully, the human brain is incredibly adaptable, and with enough practice and concentration, the ear can be trained to pick up new accents as easily as the infant ear was able to.

Regardless of the amount of speech exposure, the success with which an individual is able to lose an old accent and adopt a new one differs largely from person to person. Schelletter explained that this may have something to do with “musicality.” Learning a new speech accent requires “tuning in to the sounds, stress and intonation of the other language,” she said. This is why adopting a different accent for a language you are fluent in is easier than adopting an accent for a foreign language.

Schelletter also suggests musicality may explain why some people are better able to lose their accents than others.  For those who are truly determined to trade one accent in for another, accent modification classes are available. These classes are focused on changing sound pronunciation and stress, rhythm, and intonation of speech, and also helping the student with appropriate word choice.

They can connect at speeds between 20-300mb/s. The access point will do its best during the duration of you connection to provide you the most stable connection. During the course of your session many things can cause interference on your connection, sometimes causing your access point to put you onto a different bandwidth or frequency altogether depending on its capabilities. However, when you first connect to the access point it is trying to connect you at the highest speed possible, but once these factors come in after authentication, and you start putting bandwidth over the air, things slow down to keep it more consistent.

1ivlnk,What determines where the bubbles appear in a glass of carbonated water...and also what causes them to appear and grow in the first place? ,"I'll do my best:

The bubbles form because of a process called ""nucleation"". Nucleus is latin for kernel, nucleation is a localized thermodynamic phase transition forming around a kernel of impurity. (now that wasn't really ELI5, but bear with me)

----------

So, imagine a bottle of carbonated water, still closed off. There is a lot of pressure in the bottle, so the CO2 (carbon dioxide) gas is still dissolved in the water. It can't ""escape"" the water, because the tiny bit of air in the bottle is too ""full"" of all kinds of molecules.

The CO2 actually exists as H2CO3 (carbonic acid) molecules in the water. These combined molecules continuously interact with the H2O (water) into charged carbonate ions, and ions have the property that they stay in solution easily.

So, now you twist the cap off. Suddenly, air escapes, pressure drops, the air in the bottle isn't so ""full"" anymore. Because of this decreased pressure, the dissolved (bi)carbonate ions absorb protons to become carbonic acid again, which in turn wants to evaporate out of the water, so it splits back into CO2 and H2O.

This CO2 does *not* like to be in a solution, it wants to be a gas! When it couldn't be gas, it just made the best of the situation and turned into a comfortable form, but now it has a chance to be a gas again. 

The CO2 which is *not* near the surface doesn't really have anywhere to go though, it's still deeply submerged inside the liquid, so it can't really turn into a gas. But it REALLY wants to. The trick is, if it happens to find some impure spot like a speck of dust, the glass/plastic surface of the bottle, or an ice cube... it can start to form a ""free gas-liquid surface"", the border between liquid and gas. This bubble-surface grows quickly because other CO2 molecules hurry into the bubble, as it is the path of least resistance towards becoming gassy. Soon, this bubble is big enough to overcome forces like the ""sticky"" surface tension between the three phases of solid glass, liquid water and gassy CO2; the difference in density (weight) will cause it to pry itself loose from the surface, and move upwards (or rather, the drink moves downwards around the escaping gas bubble because water is heavier than a gas).

-------

So what causes them to appear? Nucleation around impurities or on surrounding surfaces.

What determines where bubbles appear? Surface area. A speck of dust in the water might be enough for a single bubble to nucleate around. An ice cube has a bit more surface. A finger has a lot of tiny wrinkles, and gives a lot of space for bubbles, so it ""decarbonates"" the drink really fast. Look at this [picture](_URL_0_) for an example. :)",eli5

3c8fh5,"Why do software developers completely change the user interface of their software every so often? Like the new music interface with the latest iPhone update.  The user interface is completely different now, and it is going to take users extra time now re-learn how to use it, when it still does the same thing.  Why do developers do this?","Well, the reasons fall into three categories:

1. Market
2. Usability
3. Technical

**Market:**  In your typical software company there is a position called ""Product Manager,"" whose responsibility is to figure out what the market wants, and using that to set priorities on what features need to be built by when.  Sometimes product managers get feedback from potential buyers that ""your user interface is antiquated,"" which could lead to prioritizing a UI redo.

**Usability:** Some companies have positions like ""Usability Engineer"" or ""Interaction Designer"" whose job is to figure out how to make the software easier for users.  Sometimes this sort of thing leads to a complete rewrite of the UI.

**Technical:** Technology moves on, and interfaces written with yesterday's technology might no longer be supported in newer operating systems or devices.  For example, the recent popularization of the iPhone and iPad, which don't support Adobe Flash, led to a lot of older Flash-based UIs being thrown out and replaced.  Newer devices and OSes may also have valuable features that the old UI wasn't written to use.

Another technology factor is that often it's much less costly to write a new user interface from scratch than to modify an existing one to add new features.  In software there is something called [technical debt](_URL_1_), or in more extreme cases [software rot](_URL_3_): a piece of software that is repeatedly modified to add new features and fix bugs tends to become an incomprehensible buggy mess, so that after a few years, it becomes costlier and costlier to improve it.  So it just gets rewritten.

Fourth, not in the list but not to be underestimated, is **idiocy**.  Some dude is given charge of the software decides to radically change a perfectly fine interface just for the sake of their own ego.  Often the new thing is *worse* than the old one.  See for example [the goddamn shift key in recent versions of iOS](_URL_2_).

What's worse is that idiocy is often contagious: one company will adopt a new, idiotic user interface, and [others will follow suit and imitate it](_URL_0_).",eli5

Despite hundreds of pieces of space junk covering hundreds of thousands of km's every day, almost all the time, they will pass harmlessly hundreds or thousands of km's apart. Occasionally they do collide, and the space station has a thin layer that breaks up small pieces of debris before they hit the main hull, and when any mid sized piece of debris is tracked to pass nearby, the crew prepares the soyuz ""escape pods"". So far, the space station has had no major collision, but is covered in tiny craters from flecks of paint and dust that do hit it.",eli5

3dvtd1,Why is there a small portion of Russia between Lithuania and Poland? I was doing a geography of Europe puzzle with my family when I noticed this. What's the story behind this territory and why didn't one of the two countries take that land after separating from the USSR?,"That little chunk of land, known now as the Kaliningrad oblast, used to be the easternmost part of Germany, as you can see [here](_URL_0_) in the red, and was known as Königsberg. After World War I, Königsberg,  along with the city of Danzig, was separated from the rest of Germany, as you can see [here](_URL_1_), by a chunk of Poland known as the 'Polish Corridor'. Part of the reasoning behind Hitler's invasion of Poland was the refusal of the Polish government to give up the Corridor (doing so would have cut off Poland's access to the sea).

After World War II, the USSR was occupying most of eastern Europe, including Königsberg. The thing you have to understand about the USSR then, and Russia now, is that it's greatest vulnerability is the lack of a warm-water port in the west. The only western port it has is St. Petersburg on the Gulf of Finland, as you can see [here](_URL_3_), but the Gulf frequently freezes over during winter, and the narrowness of it's mouth makes it vulnerable to a naval blockade. So during the Potsdam Conference, which was a meeting of the Big Three Powers to decide what to do with post-Nazi Europe, the Soviets demanded the northern half of Königsberg as war reparations, as seen [here](_URL_2_), to which the US and the UK agreed, giving the USSR it's own year-round warm-water port.

As to why Russia kept it after the collapse of the USSR, Kaliningrad was specifically granted to the Soviet Union rather than Poland or Lithuania, neither of which had a good claim to the land. Russia also had the same lack of a warm water port that it's predecessor did, so maintain their control of it was paramount to the new government. Additionally, since 1946 when most of the Germans were expelled, almost all of Kaliningrad's residents have been ethnic Russians, who were loyal to the new Russian state.

TL;DR: the USSR needed a warm-water port, conquered one, kept it.",eli5

However, when you look at the phone or read a book in the car, your eyes will be focused on the book/phone (which isn't moving in relation to you) but your ear sensors tell you you are moving, and so your brain gets conflicting signals. This resolves itself if you start looking at something fixed outside the car (thus your eyes and ears agree again on your movement and position).

Cutting can provide a sort of release from all the negative emotions you're feeling inside that may be difficult to process in a healthy way.

6sl1i6,Why do Fighter planes experience high G forces? How does G force work in any high speed object in general? ,"""G-Forces"" are simply the force caused by accelerating.  In your car when you step on the gas hard and slide back into your seat (if you have a good car) that's a ""G-Force"".  

A fighter jet is basically wings, and a saddle strapped onto a giant jet engine (along with guns!).  It is designed to, and does, give a lot of acceleration - thus G-Forces.  

Accelleration is ordinarily measured in science as meters/second squared.  This isn't a very handy unit however, so we just compare it to the force of gravity.  4 ""G's"" is 4 times the force of gravity, and so on.",eli5

","If you ever look at the ISS sighting times for your city, you will notice they are always early morning or late evening - never the middle of the night. This is because the sky has to be dark to see it, but the spacecraft must still be in view of the sun to reflect its light.

When you watch the ISS go by what often happens is that it appears over the horizon, travels in an arc for a few minutes and then just dissapears, this is because the station has crossed the terminator - it has passed into the shadow of the earth.

r8do1,"Why can I take a precautionary pre-movie pee that has a volume of 5 liters, but then have to race to the bathroom for fear of peeing my pants for  a thimble of urine? ","You body is able to feel when your bladder (where your pee is held inside of you) is full, however that sense of how full it is, is not perfect. And just that feeling of having a full bladder is not enough to make you want to pee, really it all goes on inside of your head. From your past experiences you know certain situations that make you want to pee and you have a rough idea of how much you have drank and how much you probably need to pee. Have you ever heard running water and suddenly had to pee? Sometimes just thinking that you have to pee is enough to trigger that switch in your brain that says ""its pee time!"" So you can see that your brain controls the urge to pee, and certain things can make you want to pee more, if you have a lot of associations in your mind between watching movies and having to pee really bad, your brain will start thinking about peeing when you see a movie and then you'll have to go. Sometimes, you can just sit there for a second and focus on your body and how full your bladder actually is, this way you can counter the mental forces telling you that you have to pee, your body can actually hold it pretty long, it just gets uncomfortable (and it does get dangerous if you hold it too long, so don't force yourself to wait if you are feeling physical discomfort). 

One thing that makes it hard for your body to actually predict when you have to go pee is that your body holds a lot of fluids that aren't in the bladder as well and those fluids might make their way to the bladder at any time. Sometimes you will get the feeling that you really have to go, but not have much in your bladder, your body is just anticipating putting more in your bladder and wants to make sure there is room.",eli5

77hec2,Why has Africa remained poor despite it's abundant resources and huge manpower?,"This is an extremely complex issue, so my answers will only cover a small portion of it:

1. Infrastructure plays a huge role.  Even if African countries have huge amounts of resources, they don't necessarily have the infrastructure in place to leverage those resources.  Not having things like rail systems, deep water ports, and road systems limit the ability of African countries to produce products and trade them on the global market.  A lack of infrastructure also limits what kind of production that can be done.  

2. Imperialism (both historical and ongoing) has limited the amount of wealth that has been reinvested back to Africa.  Usually increased economic activity helps build up states by creating revenue that can go to things like infrastructure, education, and other investments.  Much of the wealth that's been created in Africa or by Africans has gone to enrich people and companies outside of Africa.  

3. Local turmoil.  From civil wars, to widespread disease, to cultural racism, there are lots of reasons why outside entities have been hesitant to invest in Africa.  

4. Without getting too political, there is evidence to suggest that economic protectionism helps developing countries, but foreign money is only willing to do business in Africa if they adopt economic liberalism.  Many loans given to African countries are given on the condition that the countries adopt free trade policies that may actually hurt them in the long term.",eli5

5doyaf,Why is pinching yourself considered a valid method to know if you are dreaming or not? ,"I think the idea is supposed to be that the pain of the pinch would wake you up if you were dreaming.

In practice though people have done research on ""lucid dreaming"" (ie. waking up while you're dreaming), and pinching yourself isn't the way to do it.  While you do need a ""reality check"", such as trying to check the time (you can't tell time in dreams) or even just pausing for a second to think ""am I awake?"", you can't just do it in a dream ... or rather you could, if you could think to do it, but because you're dreaming you never will.  Instead, the trick is that you have to do it every time you do something that you commonly do *while you're awake*.

Since we repeat our waking lives in our dreams, if you build up the habit of the reality check in real life, you'll repeat that habit in your dream, and then ""wake up"" inside your dream.  But good luck actually waking up (fully or to a lucid dreaming state) because you saw something weird in a dream that made you pinch yourself.",eli5

He would prey on new immigrants to New York (which there were a *lot* of back at that time) and try to sell them pieces of public property like the Statue of Liberty and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, despite the fact that he didn't own any of these landmarks.  He'd convince the marks to pay him a bunch of money (usually most of their life's savings), and then disappear, and when the ""buyer"" tried to capitalize on their purchase, by setting up a toll booth or admission fee, they were removed by police and shit out of luck.

The phrase ""I've got a bridge to sell you"" comes from Parker, because the Brooklyn bridge was a common thing he tried to sell.  So someone who would be interested in buying the Brooklyn Bridge (a public road), is someone who is very gullible.",eli5

Edit: thanks everyone for your answers, love the icream analogy!  ","Ok, so do we all like ice cream?

Today you get to have any amount of your favorite flavor, and then cover it with as much topping as you want. Let's say you love chocolate sprinkles.

Your eyes shine and you scoop the biggest ice cream ball the world has ever seen. It barely sits in the cone. And now you cover it nicely all around with 2 spoonfuls of sprinkles. Nice!

Then it's your cousin's turn. To a bowl she adds the exact same amount of ice cream you did, but instead of a huge ball, she splits it in 6 smaller scoops (lame!)

But you don't expect what she does next: taking the same 2 spoonfuls of sprinkles, they just cover 2 of her scoops!

You might have the biggest ball, but she has the same amount of ice cream and her topping game beats yours. Good luck enjoying that giant dull scoop after the first bits...

1qx7z4,"Android installation - Why is it made like it is? Yesterday I flashed the Alpha CM11 KitKat for I9505 and came to think of the whole ""usable on older devices"" thing. 

Now to the question : Why isn't Android made like Windows for PC, where you have some standard system requirements, (minimum and average)? 

Like every phone with 512 mb, 1 ghz and 2 gb space? 

I know the screen and hard keys is a factor of changes, but isn't that the same as in the new laptops running Windows 8, with and without touch? 

Thanks in advance :)","TL;DR - Hardware companies want to sell new product, thus don't update software as much, Software companies want to sell you (or give you) new product, so they update the software constantly.

TouchWiz/Sense/MIUI/ColorOS/Moto/whatever-skin-is-attached is a big part of the reason why. Updates to AOSP (Android Open Source Project, the part of android that ALL Android systems are based off of) mean code-base changes which means that these skins need to be updated. 

Then you have AT & T/Verizon/Sprint/T-Mobile (if you are in the U.S.) or whatever carrier you buy from that gives you a locked phone, that has to put their bloatware on their phones as well, which takes time and money to Q & A/QA (Quality Assurance) testing, just like the skin.

You add that all up, the development and testing for updating software for older phones isn't worth it, as they aren't earning money from those phones anymore (such as the SGS1). 


In the case of Windows (and CyanogenMod/MIUI (I'll come back to this)/OmniRom/AOKP/etc.), it is developed by a separate company/entity from the hardware, so they have a reason to constantly update and get users to install their software. Samsung has no reason to push you and update to Windows 8 for free to the laptop you bought from them, just like they have no reason to push you a free update to your android phone.

Reason phones are locked is so that people don't go all crazy installing ROMS that aren't properly supported and damage their device, and request help from the company that made the phone. On top of that, it means that (if you are in the U.S. and bought a contract phone), your carrier can't guarantee their money-making bloatware is on your phone. This is also the same reason phones aren't factory-rooted.


Now, to clarify on the MIUI point from earlier, MIUI is an independently developed ROM that is backed by a company (Xiaomi), and most of the development comes from Xiaomi, however it is open source and others contribute to it. Xiaomi has no reason to push updated versions of MIUI to your phone, but it is still getting updates from the community for your phone, so you can get them from the community instead of from the company backing the development.",eli5

Superfish is dangerous because it sets up your computer to not ask the proper authority. It issues a certificate on your own machine, and since your computer thinks it's talking to an authority, it reads the certificate as valid.

 >  ""Behavioral researchers have focused on the contingencies that govern choices to delay reinforcement, and have studied how to manipulate those contingencies in order to lengthen delay. Age plays a role too; children under 5 years old demonstrate a marked lack of delayed gratification ability and most commonly seek immediate gratification.[7] A very small difference between males and females suggest that females may be better at delaying rewards.[8] The ability to wait or seek immediate reinforcement is related to avoidance-related behaviors such as procrastination, and to other clinical diagnoses such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression.""

avdtgt,"If the price of everything goes up each year to account for inflation, why can't we just not increase prices to lower the amount of inflation? ","That wouldn't work. Here is why inflation exist.

Currency is just a representation of wealth that is easier to trade. Usually wealth will increase over time. You cut down a tree, you make a plank out of it, you use it to make a house. We create wealth out of natural resources and work. The wood have more value than the tree, the plank have more value than the wood, the house have more value than the plank. You added value, or created wealth. If wealth increase, people will want to trade more, which mean they will want currency. The law of supply and demand mean that if the demand in currency increase, the supply need to follow or the value of the currency will go up. It make sense, if the wealth increase, but you keep the same amount of currency to represent it all, then each dollar will have a bigger value.

That's deflation and it's really bad in the long term for the economy (in the short term it's not too bad if small). So to fix that you need to produce currency at the same rate as the wealth is created. But it's really hard to estimate that growth in wealth so you might have errors and produce a bit too much or not enough currency.

So instead of trying to produce the same amount of currency as the wealth created, we try to produce a bit more. We target around 2% of inflation that way so that the risk of going into deflation or too high in inflation is low, even if mistakes are made.

Now a small 2% of inflation is beneficial, because it encourages people to invest their money, otherwise the value of their money will decrease over time. That's a good thing, because circulation of money is a big part of economic growth.

Now, technically speaking. If you increase the price of everything, that increase the demand of currency, which would lead to less inflation. But in theory you can't control all the prices. There will be a lot of people that will sell at normal price and get all the clients. If a country do that, people will buy from another country. But like I said, even if you could have that amount of control over all the prices, a 2% inflation is a good thing.",eli5

1. You believe that Exampletech's stock will go down from its current price of $10/share.
2. Alice owns shares in Exampletech. You agree to borrow 100 shares now, returning 105 shares to her in one week.
3. You sell those shares for $1000.
4. Exampletech's stock falls 10% to $9/share.
5. You buy 105 shares for $945 and give them to Alice.

You have gained $55, and Alice has lost $55.

This kind of transaction is risky: if Exampletech's stock had gone *up*, you would have still been on the hook for the price of 105 shares. The most that Alice can lose is the initial value of all of her shares, but if Exampletech's stock doubled to $20, for example, you'd lose $1,100. For this reason, real shorts tend to be a bit more complicated, adding collateral or other moving parts to manage the risk.

6rhmlt,"Why to big rigs have different types of tires on the FRONT and REAR of the truck? I've noticed that big rigs tend to have different tires on the front and rear. I've never understood this because I'd think having all of the tires be the same would be beneficial. When I buy tires, every company recommends that I not put tires that are uneven or mismatched on, but yet many trucks tend to have different tires on back? 

 [Front Tires](_URL_1_) | [Rear Tires](_URL_0_)

The front tires look almost bald. Could I do something similar with my own pickup truck? ","If you want another example, go to the drag strip. Even the street muscle cars swap out their rear tires for ""slicks"" which are big, specially formulated, and with little to no tread for racing purposes. When you don't have to worry about rotating your tires, you can tailor the kinds of tires for the application to increase performance or reduce cost. In the case of the race car, they get better performance. In the case of the big rig, the front wheels are probably cheaper because they don't need to be as big and tough as the rear ones which are supporting all the weight and engine power. Also, unlike a 4 wheeled passenger car, the big rig has many tires and the front wheels are not as important for maintaining grip and stopping power, they are kind of just there for steering. 

In fact, many people, including myself, have staggered wheels on our sports cars, meaning the rear wheels are wider than the front. Same concept as the drag car but to a lesser degree. Theoretically this will give more grip to the driving wheels but unfortunately, since I don't actually race, I'm really just paying a premium to look cool without taking advantage of the performance gains. 

You may notice some of the bigger pickup trucks like the f350s with the dual wheels in rear may have different tires as well to be compatible with that setup.

High inflation is pretty bad, too, because it means it’s not worth saving money and it’s really expensive to borrow money - which makes the economy tank, because nobody can start a new business. 

It’s easier to maintain a low rate of inflation than to try to keep inflation at zero (where, if you mess up, you might trigger deflation), so that’s essentially why central banks try to do that.",eli5

I had never questioned it, even when I was there, but today I realised I had no idea why Hawaii is a US state in the first place. How did it become one?

How did Hawaiians feel about becoming a state?

Australian here, by the way.","Hawaii was independent and had a native monarchy.  In the latter part of the 1800s American business interests, especially sugar plantations became increasingly powerful in Hawaii, eventually becoming the dominant power.  In 1887 these interests overthrew the Hawaii monarchy in order to attempt to gain annexation to the U.S.  This worked and Hawaii became a U.S. territory.  In became a state in 1959.

1q4z9q,Why is homelessness particularly bad for veterans? google didn't seem to give definitive answers. ,"There are two parts to this answer:  
  
1.) **Medical:** Veterans or any person who has taken place in wartime activities have a higher chance to develop post-traumatic stress disorder. This can be a difficult condition to manage and live with even when you are not homeless and have access to medical care. Being alone, and inside your head, and without basic human comforts can amplify the effects of this disorder and leave them, mentally, in a very bad place.  
  
2.) **Moral/Morale:** Homeless people are part of society, unfortunately; whether by circumstance or by choice there will always be those who cannot afford minimal comforts like shelter and food. But it's especially disheartening to the rest of us to know that the homeless guy down the street who likes to walk circles around the bus stop bench is the way he is because he served in the military. Seeing those that defend our country reduced to such a state can be a morale problem (not to mention the moral part of ""is it OK to let such people suffer so) for everybody.   
  
To be sure, not every homeless veteran is a sad story of PTSD and whatnot; veterans can make poor life choices of their own accord just like the rest of us. But I'd submit the above as my answer.",eli5

9mzp5a,"What is Treasury yields and why does it cause the market to slide? What does it mean when the news reports that US Treasury yields?

What's the Treasury's relationship with the market that causes it to slide over the week?

I've tried to read up about it, but it just gets more confusing. I was surprise to find that there are 3-month US treasury, 1-year US treasury, 2-year treasury, and so on. What are they?

The one that has gone up recently is the 10-year treasury. Why that 10-year treasury but not other intervals of treasuries? And why does that 10-year treasury have such impact to the market?

So there so many questions running in my mind. It will be great if someone can explain this to me. Thanks!","First all the quick answers:

Treasuries are US government debt.  Yields are how much interest the US government will pay lenders to loan money to them for a certain period of time.  10-year treasuries are the long term benchmark rate, they're the bench mark because they're a very liquid market.  All the other rates are just different terms (pretty similar to a 3-year, 5-year, or 7-year car loan) the government can get more money for less interest by offering a variety of terms.  

Now the why:

Treasuries are like the basic unit of investing.  The US government has a very good reputation with investors, so treasuries are the safest return one can get over a period of time.  

That means that when treasury rates rise, all other investments need to adjust (because if riskier investments don't provide at least that much return, investors are better off selling the other investment and buying the treasury).  Sort of like an employer known to hire essentially everyone paying more than other more selective employers, the selective employer is going to have to keep their wages higher than the employer who hires anyone if they want to keep getting employees.  

So when treasury yields rise, all other investment income rates also have to rise, and that means most investment prices fall.",eli5

89uj6t,why are Proteomics valuable and how are they used? ,"Proteins are important because they are the primary functional molecule in life. Almost every biological function relies on a protein to perform that function. Proteomics is the study of *proteomes*. Where a genome is all the DNA/genes in a cell or organism, a proteome is all the proteins.

There is something called the ""central dogma"" of biology, which is that DNA/genes are transcribed into RNA which is then translated into protein. This is the process of how the instructions coded into our DNA are actually performed by our cells. When proteins are made from a gene, we say that that gene is ""expressed"", and one of the key questions in biology is studying how the expression of genes changes, either between different organs and cell types or between different conditions (e.g. a healthy animal vs. one infected with a virus). 

One way to measure gene expression is to measure how much of each protein is present in the cells of interest. This is a very hard thing to do, though. Technology exists for this but it's expensive. For over a decade now, RNA-seq has been used instead which instead of measuring the amount of proteins present, it instead measures the amount of RNA. This is an ok proxy, since that RNA is usually translated into their respective proteins, but it's not perfect. An RNA molecule can be used multiple times before it degrades, or it might not be used at all. There are various mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation, where a gene is regulated not by controlling the amount of RNA produced from it, but instead by controlling how the RNA is translated. So there may be genes with plentiful RNA detected, but actually none of the protein they code for.

So proteomics would be a better way of studying gene expression, but it's currently not as prevalent yet. As the technology advances it will probably start to replace RNA-seq as the primary way of doing gene expression studies.",eli5

There is also a sort of fraternity among smokers that you loose. Many people met lots of friend over bumming, giving away cigarettes to others. Smoke breakers usually move in crowds, whether in work or in bars and it is a social network that can get you laid or advance your career (if your boss smokes, if a hot friend of a friend smokes, you get new ways too talk to them.)

Smoking is like a little present you get every day with all sorts of great memories and people attached to it. It's not just raw addiction to the drug that makes people miserable, it is loosing the habit itself.

pv9li,"Why Jackson Pollock Is So Popular I am very naive when it comes to ""Modern Art"" and would like to get a better understanding as to why his work is so renowned. Thank You.","Pollack was successful for a large number of reasons, some of which were in his control and some of which were not. First thing we need to get out of the way is that it's important to realize his work is widely *renowned* as you say, but that doesn't mean it's widely *liked*. That said, the perfect storm that brewed around Pollack's success, in a nut shell-

1) **He did something really unique in a period of time when things weren't very unique.** Modern art was basically over by the time Pollack came around. ""Modern Art,"" as a movement began in the 1850's roughly, and really exploded between 1900 and 1915. WWI killed a lot of modernists. There were new modernist movements between WWI and WWII, but not nearly as many, and post-WWII, a lot of things started getting stagnant. Pollack did something new (action painting, drip painting) when things had just started getting stale in the art world.

2) **He did something new, and it got a lot of attention**.

3) **He did something that was easy to sell to a wide number of clients**. Being successful in art is part talent and a lot of business. Pollack had the distinct advantage of being one of the first TRULY abstract artists, and as such, his work wasn't at all political, religious, personal, or symbolic. Pollack was able to produce a lot of paintings pretty quickly, and buyers were willing to grab them up so long as the colors matched their decor. Pollack's paintings were regularly bought because they could be put into a room as part of decoration. Unlike classical oil paintings, Pollack's paintings looked good pretty much no matter where you put them. They were neutral, inoffensive, and finding one to match your color scheme wasn't hard.

4) **He helped start the American Abstract Expressionists**, who basically made a lot of really abstract work that could be sold very easily, much like his.

5) Looking at his value in the scheme of art history, **Pollack was a major player in bridging the gap between Modernism and Post-Modernism**. His production methods were highly modernist, emphasizing (above even the old school Modernists of 1900-1915) the idea of *form follows function*. He didn't try to make the paint look like a person or a landscape. He just let the paint *be* paint. The neutrality of his work bridged the theory side of post-modernism, where his work meant something to him as a producer (the actions and motions which went into making them), but they meant something entirely different to the audience, and neither he nor his audience were ""wrong,"" in how they interpreted the paintings because they lacked the illusion of a subject matter.",eli5
biatr1,Why does it seem like time goes faster as you get older?,"This isn't really a physics question so much as a psychology question. Basically this comes down to your subjective, psychological understanding of time, and especially memories. 

Time seems to ""go slow"" when you are making a lot of unique memories. Time seems to ""go fast"" when you are no longer making many unique memories. Think about it like this. When you reflect on a past week and remember unique events for every day, you remember every day as a unique day and it feels like a long week. But if you can't remember anything over the past week, it feels like that week went by in a flash and time moved quicker.

When you are young, every new experience is new and fresh and you remember it because it's new. Because of this, you have a lot of memories of when you are young, and you subjectively feel like time ""moved slower"" when you were young.

As you get older, you fall into daily, typically monotonous, routines and each day becomes rather similar to the previous one and you have much fewer unique memories. Because of this, each day isn't as special and you remember less and less days, and time seems to ""go faster"".",eli5

3jc17y,Why does the period table end at atomic number 103? Why can't there be elements with higher atomic numbers? ,"There are. They just have to be artificially created. You're possibly referencing an older periodic table from before their creation - [here's a modern one showing the higher atomic numbers](_URL_0_)

Picture cramming a lot of people that really don't like each other into a small area, as an analogy for cramming a lot of protons (positively charged nuclear particles) into an atomic nucleus. Eventually the dislike really becomes too strong for the people to stick around and they won't do it, immediately leaving. Same goes for atomic numbers that are too high. Physics won't allow atoms above a certain size to exist unless they're created artificially using particle accelerators, and then they fly apart almost immediately after their creation.

This resistance to natural creation actually starts a bit earlier, more or less after atomic number 92 (Uranium), and the ones that are higher require atomic explosive events or neutron bombardment or particle acceleration to form. And there's a lot more elements that come later than 103 now as we've increased our ability to create them with more powerful accelerators and stuff.",eli5

If it was upped to 240 (which is easier to transmit long distances), they would burn out pretty quickly.

By the time Europe got into building their electrical infrastructure, 240 volt bulbs were good enough that they could just use straight 240v. But by this time, America already had the standard of 120.

1qk25r,"Why can I kick a ball moving towards me faster and further than one already moving in the direction I'm aiming for? In games like football (soccer), you often have a ball moving towards you. Why is it that you are able to kick the ball much further and faster when it is travelling towards you than when it is already moving in the direction of travel, or if it is still?

","Inflated balls can compress the air within them, acting like a spring. This enables a kicker to make the ball accelerate faster than the foot that hits it, as the expansion of the ball will cause it to spring off the kicker's foot.

A stationary ball can be compressed, but as it is free to move the full force of the kick is difficult to apply into compressing the ball. A ball moving toward the kicker's foot has momentum which will keep the far side of the ball moving toward the foot, compressing it more and storing that energy for the bounce back.

More simply, consider what happens if you throw a ball at a wall compared to if you set one next to it. The original force of movement of the thrown ball is redirected, but the stationary one doesn't have any.",eli5

Cellular service providers placed antennas on existing towers, leased land for new ones where necessary, and gradually increased coverage where it was most profitable. You need a license from the government for a broadcasting installation like that, as well as permission from local government.

I know why they have different amount of days, but why not stagger them with all of the 31 day months together and then the 30 day months and then February?","I'm not sure about this 100%, but this is how I understand it:

Originally, there were ten months. January and February were originally a monthless period because no crops would grow. This is why September - December are named the way they are (Sept = 7, Oct = 8, etc). So, February was the ""last"" month created, and therefore has the least amount of days, and the whole leap day thing.

Apart from that, the length of days in each month alternates from 31 to 30, with the exception of July and August which both have 31. Legend has it that Augustus Caesar refused to lend his name to a month that had fewer days than that of Julius Caesar's, forcing calendar makers to break the sequence.",eli5

16r0yn,"The effects of Meth So I'm watching breaking bad, and it's making me curious; why does meth rot the body so much? Why do people get those nasty sores? Why do some people in the show not get as addicted to it as others? Is that realistic? What does it feel like to be on? ","> Why do people get those nasty sores?

Meth users often experience a psychological effect called [Dermatillomania](_URL_0_). This is the cause of the sores, they are self inflicted.

 > Why do some people in the show not get as addicted to it as others? Is that realistic?

Yes it is realistic. While it is **highly** addictive, it is not 100% addictive. Some people are able to use for short durations and quit using at their own discretion.

 > What does it feel like to be on? 

The brain has a function to reward you for biologically beneficial behavior such as eating, procreation, surviving in general. This is accomplished using a chemical called dopamine.

Meth triggers an uncontrolled release of dopamine. While I've never used, I can imagine that the first hit is probably one of the best feelings you will ever have in your entire life. An overwhelming sense of satisfaction, happiness, etc.

The problem is that you will never feel it again. The process by which dopamine makes us feel good is degraded with each use of meth. 

The more destruction of this process that takes place, the more dopamine you need to release to feel the same level of happiness. This results in meth users chasing that first experience, and why it is such a huge addiction risk. Eventually this neurological process is so damaged that they need the excessive dopamine levels just to feel normal.",eli5
514yeo,"Why does Jupiter appear to be 'layered'? [Like this](_URL_0_)

It looks like its made of many flat layers

why reddit, why!?

Edit: What causes this banding, if anyone knows?","I assume you mean why does it have horizontal stripes in latitude: it does also have layers as you down inside it, but those aren't obvious in this picture.

It's a consequence of ""conservation of angular momentum.""  This is the effect that causes an ice skater to spin faster when she pulls her arms toward her body: if part of a spinning object moves closer to the axis of rotation, the object will start spinning much faster.  Jupiter as a whole spins very fast (once every 11 hours), so this rule matters.

Hot air rising up from deep inside Jupiter creates small storms: the small swirling motions you see in the photo.  These storms merge and combine to form bigger storms (the big red and white ovals), but conservation of angular momentum puts a limit on how big they can get *in the north-south direction*.  Parts of each storm will be moving air north-south, which brings the air closer or farther from the axis of rotation: this means the air starts moving around the planet's axis faster or slower than the rest of the planet, which means north-south winds are converted into east-west winds.

That means that the north-south size of atmospheric structures is limited, but the east-west size is not.  As a result, as storms continue to merge, they form long skinny east-west bands that stretch around the whole planet.

You see this in every planet's atmosphere, but because the planets have different sizes and rotation rates, the limiting length scale (called the Rhines scale) is different.  [Saturn has bands like Jupiter](_URL_1_), but because they're covered in a layer of high haze, they're harder to see.  On Earth, the Rhines scale is about a quarter the size of the planet, so we see a sort of [""four-banded"" atmosphere](_URL_0_) with a tropical and mid-latitude circulation cell in each hemisphere.  Venus, on the other hand, rotates very slowly, so its Rhines scale is bigger than the planet, so the atmosphere is just [one big band.](_URL_2_).

American foreign affairs have always intrigued me and especially post WWII world relations. I've searched all over but can't find a basic explanation on why it matters to the west and in particular to the U.S. Usually it's just news reports but they never explain what it is or why it matters to us. Anyone care to explain?","The ""Arab Spring"" is the common term used to describe a series of massive popular protests and political upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa that began with protests in Tunisia in 2010, and ultimately spread, in one form or another to a large number of other countries, including Egypt, Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Bahrain.  

It matters to the United States for two principle reasons.  First, it represented a major change in the balance of political power in these countries.  Take Egypt, for example, where a pro-U.S. dictator was replaced by a much more anti-U.S. Islamist, who in turn lost power in the face of more protests.  These kinds of changes in who wields power requires the U.S. to change its approach to Foreign Policy in the region.  

Second, many saw---and still see---the protests as a transitional moment for that part of the world, one that will play a large role in determining how politics develop for many decades.  Who wins or looses during these shifts may well determine whether the region is more or less stable, more or less democratic, more or less free, and more or less able/willing to combat terrorists. 

And, honestly, it was also interesting to the West because it is a genuinely interesting thing, to watch fellow people struggle in an attempt to improve their political and economic condition.  Many naturally are interested in that struggle and rooting for one side or another.",eli5

71gf3k,"Why do some surgeries take multiple hours? There's a famous photo of a doctor and his assistant resting after a 23-hour heart transplant. Every time I hear of a surgery taking 8+ hours, I wonder what they are doing that whole time? I know they have to be careful and obviously aren't being hasty, but if surgeries are essentially just cutting parts out and sewing parts back together, how does something like that take 8+ hours?","Due to the size and number of blood vessels and tissues that need to be rejoined or joined for the first time in some cases it takes a longer amount of time. For some surgeries doctors have to use robotics due to the precision and size of the instruments needed. Sometimes when a doctor opens up a person to do a routine surgery they discover complicating factors that will make the surgery longer like if said person has a difference in blood vessels than what is considered normal or average. 

Basically the more a surgeon has to do the longer the surgery. What constitutes as 'more' depends on what surgery you're talking about. 

If you're asking why the same surgery might take longer than average or what is expected that might be due to as I said differences in that person's internal structures when compared to what is considered average or normal. 

If you're asking why one surgery takes drastically longer than another different surgery then that simply comes down to the amount of things involved in each surgery like connecting blood vessels, stopping bleeds, and so on. 

But the heart transplant you're talking about was the first successful heart transplant in that country at the time. It was done before the operation had a set procedure as to how to approach it and what to do if something went wrong. In cases like that, as in surgeries that aren't super common, it's a matter of the surgeon being in unfamiliar territory, as far as the surgery goes, and taking their time in order to make sure they do not do anything that could cause the patient harm or be detrimental to the quality and length of the patient's life.",eli5

2p4fzt,why is fried chicken and watermelon heavily associated with black americans? ,"In the South fried chicken was commonly used as a food for slaves, since it's cheap to produce and each chicken has a lot of meat. Consequently it was also used in a lot of racist propaganda, depicting black people eating fried chicken and watermelon (apparently especially popularized by Birth of a Nation).

I've also seen some claims that  it has to do with how inherently messy both things are. You eat it with your hands, it gets all over your face, and so on. I'm sure that made it easier to depict black people as uncivilized and dirty in the aforementioned propaganda.

Today it's become a more subtle way of making racist comments, since it's easier to claim that you simply had no idea, and just thought it was a cultural food. I'm not sure anyone really buys that, but that doesn't really matter in the current short attention span of the media.",eli5

So when the tire spins, it has a curtain number of rotations per minute/second. A camera taking a video, takes a picture multiple times per minute/second. What happens is that the tire is rotating just slightly slower than the camera's picture taking speed so I'm the time between two pictures, the tire had rotated 99% of the way, 1% of a rotation behind where it started. Then as you continue this, the tire keeps getting 1% off per picture. So when you play it all back, in each picture you see the the tire slightly behind where it was in the previous one, thusly giving the illusion of the tire moving backwards.

2aqvzu,"Why is NSA still allowed to do whatever they want, and how long will it continue? ","This is going to be a bit more than ELI5, but stick with me.

In 1978, the USA set up the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC or FISA Court) to approve sensitive requests for surveillance by federal law enforcement (read: the NSA).  Because this court deals with top secret (""classified"") information, it operates behind closed doors.  From 1978 until 2001 the court operated with little to no public attention. 

After 9/11, the U.S. gov't took measures to combat terrorism, the most famous of which is the USA PATRIOT Act.  This changed large parts of the legality of surveillance both within and without the United States of America and many believe gave the NSA unparalleled power.  Given the fact the governing body of the NSA (the FISA Court) operates ex-parte (i.e. with just the participation of the judge and government) the NSA was able to do a lot more than the general public knew about.

The Snowden leaks showed that the NSA was not only keeping the public in the dark, but also members of the US Congress.  **That answers the ""why can they do whatever they want"" part; simply, because they legally can.**

As far as ""how long will it continue""?  This will change if the laws change and the laws will change if the public demands that they do (by voting for privacy-conscious gov't representatives, etc.).  Unfortunately, while there is a general ""stink"" in the media about mass-surveillance, no one wants to be the politician that goes actively against the NSA because (god forbid) another attack happens and he will be known as the ""pro-terror"" or ""anti-gov't"" or ""anti-safety"" or ""weak-on-crime"" politician.

m1ca5,Why shouldn't Iran be allowed to have nuclear weapons? There always seems to be a lot of talk about Iran getting ready to have their own nuclear weapons and I don’t really understand why the US (and other countries) is/are talking about it like it’s the worst thing that could ever happen. Why are the US  &  Russia (and others) “allowed” to have them if these people also say “you shouldn’t have them”. I don’t understand why any country thinks it can forbid other countries doing what they’re also doing. Thanks in advance. :),"Basically its to do with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which almost all countries signed.

You're right that it basically says ""No-one is allowed to get nuclear weapons if they didn't already have them when they signed the treaty"", which seems a little unfair. However, the treaty is what it is, and every country in the world has signed up except from India, Israel and Pakistan. Additionally North Korea originally signed, but then pulled out, and Taiwan is a bit of a odd-case, but they're effectively covered.

So the situation is that Iran has signed an agreement that says they won't develop nuclear weapons, and if they were attempting to then that'd be a violation of the treaty.

Whether or not they're attempting to make nuclear weapons is something open for debate. Iran says that, whilst they are doing things that look like they might be making nuclear weapons (enriching uranium) that is only for the purpose of their Nuclear Power station and related civilian power research, and thus it is allowed under the treaty.

The US on the other hand doesn't believe Iran and thinks that it is doing work to develop nuclear weapons, and thus imposes restrictions on Iran as best it can.

In the end it is basically the big boys with all the power bullying smaller countries into not having nuclear weapons, whilst they hypocritically keep them themselves. Whether or not you think that's fair, the fact is we are alot safer as a world with less nuclear weapons in, so perhaps the ends justify the means.


Its also worth noting that all the countries that aren't covered by the NPT (Israel, Pakistan, India, North Korea) have subsequently gone on to make nuclear weapons.",eli5

My dad isn't like this, his hair is more uniform and he has full beard. I've to add that my leg hairs are very thick but my arms and chest hair are much thinner.

Edit: wording","Doctor Here. **Caveate** Hair is not my specialty. Most of what I am about to say is based on basic science and stuff I learned almost a decade ago. The biology/pysiology of hair growth may have changed drastically since I last reviewed this stuff. :


**The Basic Layout**

Your body, from head to toe, is covered in millions of hair follicles. It doesn't matter weather you are a man or woman. The majority of these hair follicles are dormant when you are born (that's way babies are hairless, except for the hair on their head, and the laguno on their bodies (which eventually disappears))

**Follicle Activation**

Which follicles become active and which follicles remain dormant is entirely a question of genetics. There is no single gene that is responsible for hair growth. It is more likely a combination of several genes. Which genes get turned on and which genes get turned off is complex science referred to as epigenetics. 

The end result of your genes is weather a follicle become active or remains dormant. An active follicle will dark, thick grow hair (terminal hair). A dormant follicle will grow no hair , or very very fine hair (villus hair). 

What determines weather a hair follicle is active or dormant: **5AlphaReductase**: This enzyme (produced by the follicle) converts normal testosterone into the potent DHT (dihydrotestosterone). 


**Hormones: The Effect of Dihydrotestosterone**

DHT is responsible for stimulating hair growth. The more testosterone you have in your body, more of it is convereted to DHT (provided your genetics have programmed your follicular cells to produce **5alpha reductase) and the more hair you grow. 

**The Androgen Paradox**

For some reason, the follicles on the scalp do not respond to too much DHT - and they tend to shut down when there is an excess of DHT. Conversely, the follicles in the rest of the body don't have their paradoxical sensitivity - and the more DHT you produce, the more hair you grow.

**The science behind finesteride: a treatment for male pattern baldness**

Finasteride (Propecia) is a **5AlphaReductase ibhibitor**. The purpose of this is to block the production of DHT. With less DHT, the hope is that the follicles in the scalp will begin to grow more hair.",eli5

1smdxa,"Why can some websites not produce a comma/apostrophe and it only shows up as �? I've been to a few websites that have this problem and it isn't really a problem, but I just wonder why ""�"" exists.","This comes down to character set encoding.
Let's break it down

1.  The website you are on has text stored using a specific character set (the most common is UTF-8)
2.  When a webpage loads, the site should tell you what character set it is encoded in (normally something like  < meta content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type"" >  in the HTML)
3.  Your browser interprets that as ""cool - this site's text is using UTF-8, we'll translate it using this character set""

As mentioned, the most common is UTF-8, when websites don't specify their character set, browsers will generally just assume it's UTF-8.

Therefore there are a few situations when you get the � symbols

1. websites uses a different character set, and do not state what it is for the browser
2. website specifies the incorrect character set for the browser to use
3. your browser is loading the wrong character set (maybe you manually changed it)

You can force your browser to use a different character set. In chrome you can do this by going to Tools  >  Encoding

1z266g,"Why do most predatory animals choose not to eat humans? I know it happens, but the vast majority of animal / human attacks never end up in with the human actually being eaten unless there are some dire circumstances involved. I've seen and heard many examples of a person being attacked and then the attacking animal just leaves inexplicably. For example, many shark attacks are simply the shark ""tasting"" its ""prey"" when they realize its human they take off. Why is this? Do we taste bad? If so why? Or do animals just know that its a bad idea to attack the most awesome predator thats had ever lived on this planet? ","Through evolution, predators become specialized towards particular prey or categories of prey. They develop hunting patterns that take advantage of their prey's behavior patterns (e.g. stalking vs ambush vs pursuit), and learn to recognize certain types of animals as efficient sources of food. Most of this is pattern-matching instinct, built up over generations of trial-and-error selecting the most effective instincts. Animals that tend towards more-efficient prey succeed.

Predators that adapt to specialize towards humans, don't last very long. We counter-adapt on the order of years instead of generations so animals are always behind the curve in terms of efficiency. We also counter-hunt predators for our own safety, meaning that succeeding in predating humans is actually maladaptive, and will be selected against.

Most modern animal attacks are not specialized predation. Often they are self-defense, which means that the animal is not inclined to eat the remains.

The controversy in CISPA is centered on ""what data will be shared"".  The government would like to define that later, agilely, as threats evolve.  However, that allows almost unlimited abuse, which doesn't seem like the right answer.

2jclbi,"Why does it seem like there are way more conspiracy theorists in the USA now than 20 years ago? I grew up in the 90s.  Occasionally you'd meet someone who thought Bill Clinton was lying about some major issue (other than the beej issue) but overall people who distrusted the government on every issue were viewed as tinfoil hat lunatics.  After 9/11, I remember some people thinking it was an inside job, and I think there was a huge increase of conspiracy theorists due to that, but even then, people who said that GWB ""did 9/11"" were laughed at.

Now, it seems like no matter what article I read, MOST of the comments are conspiracy related, blaming Obama for something as weird as flu season or ebola.  Whenever any national shooting/tragedy happens, I'm inundated with blog posts about how it was a false flag.  It's gotten to the point where I feel like believing most of what the government/CDC says (or at least trusting that if they withhold information it's for good reason) actually puts me in the minority.  Even when I read an article on a major site like CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc...most of the comments are badly-spelled rantings about how Obama is infecting Americans with ebola on purpose through the Mexican border (??)

I belong to another forum that is comprised of mostly well-educated women.  Most believe ebola is already airborne, the CDC is covering it up, and about half believe that flu shots are more dangerous than the flu.  Tons of Americans choose not to get the flu shot even though the flu is proven to be way more likely to kill you.

So where are all these people coming from?","Probably has a lot to do with the fact far more people have gotten on the internet in the past 10 years.

20jrsi,"Why don't commercial airplanes get faster? We have all these military jets that break the speed of sound, and yet a commercial flight probably still takes the same amount of time it did forty years ago. Why is it not improving? Have we reached a limit in speed for aircrafts that size, or is it a matter of cost-efficiency?","Flying supersonic is not allowed over most plots of land. The sonic boom will actually propagate all the way to the ground and cause noise pollution. The Concorde did fly supersonic, but it flew mostly across the Atlantic Ocean, so noise pollution was not an issue.

The upper limit of most subsonic commercial liners is 0.8 Mach. That is they are flying at 80% of the speed of sound. The reason they don't fly 0.99 Mach is because certain local portions of the air flow over the wings (mostly the upper surface of the wing) actually move faster than the aircraft is traveling. So if a plane is flying 99% the speed of sound, it is almost guaranteed that portions of the airflow over the wing are traveling faster than the speed of sound. 

However, that isn't a huge issue. The biggest issue is the unsteadiness. The airflow over the wing isn't constant and varies with time. So local airflow over the wing will actually be supersonic and then the next second will be subsonic, and then supersonic and subsonic. This will cause massive shaking as the supersonic and subsonic physics are very very different. 

You do not want to fly close to the speed of sound because of this. You either want to fly significantly below it (0.8 Mach) to avoid any portion of the airflow going sonic, or you want to fly significantly above it so that you form a strong shockwave in front of the aircraft.

So there are many reasons why not. Mostly the noise pollution over land is the biggest issue, but obviously efficiency, and safety factors are also concerns. If contentinal flights offered supersonic speeds, then efficency wouldn't be a huge issue. The market for supersonic commerical flights is just so small because you can really only fly supersonic over the ocean.

If there's a popular consensus that we're causing global warming by burning fossil fuels, this will cause legislation to be passed which disincentivises the burning of fossil fuels by fining or taxing polluters or providing incentives and tax breaks to green energy companies.

lyuhh,why a car travelling at 50mph in 3rd gear uses more fuel than a car travelling at 50mph in 5th gear without violating conservation of energy ,"Remember is that conservation of energy doesn't mean that all the energy you put into something comes back out in a useful way. It just means all of it comes back out in *some* way.

In cars, only a little bit of the energy you get from burning fuel actually makes the car go. The rest gets wasted. Most of it gets wasted as heat. The engine gets hot (so hot that it needs a whole system to cool it off with a radiator). The smoke coming out the tailpipe is hot, too. All that heat is energy that's not being used to make the car go.

Some of that heat comes from the actual burning of the fuel itself, but some of it also comes from something scientists call *friction*. Friction is what makes it hard to rub things together. It takes moving energy and turns it into (mostly) heat energy. Every moving part of the engine is experiencing some friction, and that friction is taking some of the energy that could otherwise make the car move and instead turning it into heat that gets wasted.

You can experiment with friction using nothing more than your two hands. Rub them slowly against each other. Your hands will start to feel warm where they were rubbing. Now rub them faster -- twice as fast, if you can manage it. Your hands will feel a lot warmer. Now try rubbing them twice as fast *again* (four times faster than the first time). They'll feel *way* warmer.

When you increase the speed a little bit, you increase the energy lost to friction by a lot. If you could measure it, you'd find that rubbing your hands twice as fast makes *four* times as much heat. And rubbing them four times as fast makes *sixteen* times as much heat. This is just a fact about nature. A scientist might word it as, ""frictional losses are proportional to the square of velocity.""

So now you can see how this relates to the engine. A car going 50 miles per hour in 3rd gear is probably running its engine at twice the speed (usually measured in *rotations per minute*, or RPM) that a car going 50 miles per hour in 5th gear would be. As we just learned, doubling the speed quadruples the friction. So that car in 3rd gear is turning twice as much energy into heat as the car in 5th gear.",eli5

Affect, which is almost always a verb, is an **A**ction word.

Effect, which is almost always a noun, is an **E**ntity.

The one exception for affect is something you probably won't run across unless you go into psychology or medicine -- a patient can have a ""flat affect"" (a noun), meaning that they're showing no emotional reaction to anything.

Effect can be a verb in a sentence like, ""The committee wanted to effect a change in their rules."" Note that in this use, effect will always have an object; that is, somebody will be trying to effect something to happen. But you can usually find a better way to say it without having to use the word this way -- ""The committee wanted to change their rules"" means the same thing, really.",eli5

6k9sqo,"How come certain sounds or music, like a film score to a horror film for example. Why do they scare/unsettle us? ","I had read one time that the sounds that make us unnerved / put us on edge / creep us out mimic the warning sounds from other animals or primitive humans that alerted us to the presence of a predator. Those sounds of warning trigger our flight or fight response which puts us in a hyper alert state. 

This is similar to the fear of clowns. It is theorized that the fear of clowns comes from our ability to not fully recognize facial features like eyes and mouth when the clown make-up is on. Basically, primitive man had to be wary of large predators. We would scan the tall grasses of the plains or thickness of the jungles looking for certain patterns that would alert us to a predator such as eyes staring at us or certain facial features. 

Humans are very good at this pattern recognition. So good in fact that in modern times we see things like the Virgin Mary in toast or (thanks to reddit for pointing this out) Jesus in the fur pattern of a dog's rear end. Because clown makeup obscures the facial features it ""may"" trigger this fear. But again, it's just a theory and we still don't know why / where the fear of clowns comes from.",eli5

37fbyx,"If humans need salt and water to live, why can't humans survive off of ocean water? ","Short answer: The amount of salt is to high for are body to process so are body has to add more water to it.

A kidney cannot make urine from a concentration of salts of more than 2%. Seawater is made up of approximately 3% salt, so if we drink it to quench our thirst the kidneys have to use existing water from our body in order to dilute the extra salt, which in turn makes us feel even thirstier. This is due to the osmosis process where the kidneys can only generate urine which is less salty than the water we drink. Consequently, the body tends to urinate more to be able to eliminate the excess of salt but instead of elimination, the result is the formation of more salt as the urine obtained is always less salty than the original. The body would have to expulse more liquid than the amount drunk, which is impossible and that’s why the effect of drinking water from the sea is, paradoxically, dehydration.

If we drink a litre our kidneys would need at least one and a half litres of fresh water to dilute all the salt, so this means that they would be forced to extract an extra half a litre from our body.

**It would be possible to drink small doses of seawater, just one spoon of seawater at 20 minute intervals, drinking very slowly and letting the saliva in your mouth reduce the saline in the water you have swallowed. A man named Alain Bombard demonstrated this a few decades ago in an experiment called “Voluntary Castaway”.**

For a less ridiculous example, imagine your friend has this system: For every $5 you give him today, he'll give you back $10 in a year. A bit less unreasonable, but this would still be a really great profit for you. You wouldn't give him every cent you have, obviously: You want to keep enough money to pay your bills for the year, buy food, save a bit for emergencies, and probably some spending money in case you wanted to buy a new game or go to the movies every now and then. Even so, you'll still probably want to give most of your spare money to him, because you'll profit so much off of it. If they lend it to you at a good interest rate, you might even borrow some money from friends or family *just* to lend it to your friend for a year, since you'll probably still profit from that. Even if you owed someone some money, it might be worth it to accept the late fees, because you'll have more money in a year from giving it to your friend instead of paying what you already owe.

This is the system that big companies are in: They *could* pay billions towards their debt now, but that might not be the best way to use their money. If instead they invest it in their own growth, they might multiply it several times over within the next few years, meaning that (even with interest rates and inflation) they'll profit more in the end compared to if they had just paid off all of their debts right away.

EDIT TO ADD: I tried to keep my explanation simple and focused just on one reason for this, but people in the comments have pointed out that it was overly simplified and missed some (more nefarious) elements of why companies might do this. Since I'm not an expert on the following, please take this next paragraph with a grain of salt, and look into it on your own to understand how it works:

Companies might not want to bring money earned overseas back into the US, because that could cost them a lot on taxes. They might want to invest it, or if that's not possible or likely to give them a good return, they might just sit on the money until the government offers another repatriation tax holiday (When the government gives companies a time to bring money back to the US at a ***heavily*** reduced tax rate).",eli5

The scientists looking for radio waves aren't expecting all other life to use radio waves but they are hoping that if we stumbled upon radio as one of the best ways to transmit long distances, then it's logical to assume that someone else might have stumbled upon it as well.

Additionally radio is a relatively low tech solutions so they are also hoping that, even if this imaginary race moved beyond radio waves to something else, they might recognize that others haven't advanced that far and still use radio to send a message.

I know the stream of a cable provider and a satellite signal contain EVERY single channel and your tuner just picks up the one you want and decrypts it. 

But why isn't there such a thing for the Internet, where everything (youtube, netflix, hulu...) is just a signal broadcasting all the time and you just pick the one video you want to watch, when you want to watch it ?","That's because the satellite signal is sending every channel to everyone as a single signal.

It's as if someone is standing in the middle of a packed gymnasium with a loud speaker.  When he talks, everyone in the audience can hear the same information even though he's only speaking once.  He doesn't need to speak to each person individually.

The internet on the other-hand, is like a telephone network.  When you call someone, you are getting information on a 1-on-1 basis.  That's why you can stream video on-demand through the internet.  When you watch a video on youtube, there's is a server that is serving up the video directly to you.

4lvoor,Why there are two different colors on each side of a table tennis racket and what's the difference between them? ,"There's quite a substantial difference in types of rubber and glue. It affects things like how fast the ball bounces off the paddle, how much spin can be put on the ball. If the ball is already spinning significantly, the softer, stickier rubber will also be more impacted by that spin, meaning that if the ball comes at the paddle with top spin, it's going to go up, and with underspin, down.

Table tennis is very much a game of spin. Spin causes the ball to curve through the air, bounce off the table differently, and bounce off the racket differently. Because of how significant spin is to the game, competitive players often disguise the type of spin they're putting on the ball. This includes things like hitting the ball below the table, stomping on the ground when they hit the ball, or changing the direction of their stroke at the last minute. If you can make the other player think the ball is spinning differently than it is, they're much more likely to make a mistake.

As an example, I have a racket that has dead rubber on one side and fast rubber with high spin on the other side.

The black side is unaffected by existing spin, and just returns it as is. If my opponent puts heavy spin on the ball, it bounces straight off my paddle and is returned with that same spin. The black side also slows down the return and drops the ball much closer to the net.

The red side is fast and imparts heavy spin.

I can make motions with the black side that look like they would induce spin, and it returns a dead ball. If my opponent watches my motion and assumes spin, they're likely to overcompensate and hit the ball off the table. I can then ""twiddle"" (flip the paddle) and impart heavy, fast spin.

If the opponent can't visually tell between the two sides of a paddle, this would give some players an unfair advantage. Because of this, different colors of rubber are mandated by competitive table tennis rules.",eli5

What it does is allocate the processor to different processes so one program doesn't hog it all. Your mouse is almost always one of the highest. This is why you can still move your mouse when your computer is frozen. Another high up process is the Ctrl+Alt+Delelete trigger. This way, even if there is a laggy application, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, your mouse, and your keyboard still work. The processor makes sure your mouse works before giving any processing power to the application. This is why the mouse must be low latency (it must be a low processor-using application so the rest of your computer can use the processor).

38ttwl,"How come you supposedly can't catch Mono twice? (Or at least, it is very unlikely?) This also applies to other illnesses you can catch and supposedly can't catch twice.","This is actually a fairly common thing, and it's how the immune system works. 

When you get a new germ/virus, your immune system fights it off. If it's a new one and it hits strong enough it can take your immune system time to respond and create antibodies, which is why you get sick. 

Once your immune system creates an antibody, though, it remembers that jerk for next time, and it doesn't have to figure out how to kick it's butt. Think of it like a bouncer at a club. First time you come in and wreck the place it might take them a while to kick you out, but the next time you show up they'll go ""You again?"" and just kick your butt out in the street. 

As /u/mugenhunt says, this is how a lot of vaccines work - they give you a weakened (or even dead) version of the virus, and your immune system learns how to deal with it. 

""But SterlingPhoenix,"" I hear you asking, ""How come I keep getting a @#$% cold?"" 

Well, some viruses, like the cold or flu, have learned that the immune system will remember them, so they go home, dye their hair, put on different clothes and maybe get some plastic surgery and then show up at the club again with a fake ID, so the bouncer lets them in again, and once they start beating people up with pool cues they go ""Oh crap it's that flu bastard again, he keeps getting past us with his amazing disguises!"" and then develop all new antibodies.",eli5

Lots of lovely fresh blood in the matrix helps make nice strong fingernails. (""the matrix' is the part above your nail until the first knuckle. This is where the ""horny"" tissue is made, and why if you smash that part of your finger in a window, it not only hurts like a bastard, but your nail will grow out all wonky.)  So yes, fingernails actually do grow a little bit faster.   

2)Your eyes and your nerve endings. Your hands and fingers are hanging out with you all day, you're always doing stuff together, typing, eating, checking your phone. If you get a hangnail or a snaggy corner or they get too long, you know about it right away because you can see it, you can feel it. Your feet are not only tucked away in your shoes, but even barefoot, they are harder to visually inspect. Your hands can touch themselves and each other, and do, thousands of times every day. Your toes touch the insides of your socks, or the floor. This of course doesn't make your fingernails grow faster, but it helps give you the impression that they are.

Say, if your phone conversations had been recorded for the past ten years and you didn't know.  Did that affect you over that ten years?

Remember, ""average citizen"".  That's barring getting arrested based on that evidence or whatever for current crimes.

However, people's problem with such invasions of privacy shouldn't be whether you'd be embarrassed about your porn fetishes or the fact that you do whatever else you'd simply rather not people know about.  It's not even about being caught in the act of something currently illegal.

The whole intent of the bill of rights to begin with was to help stave of tyranny and to protect people should that sort of thing happen.

Something like this is data that could potentially be used as a ""list""  A government having a list of people who were Jewish, would make it very easy for someone to target people for incarceration, abuse, or violence, for a well known example.

It's not about how the government may abuse such data tomorrow, but next year, in 5 years, a decade, or several decades.  What could be done with such data?  Say, our government is more or less ""good"" for a few decades but then some really bad people get into power, your grandkids go off the grid so as to not reveal that they're Jewish(just to use the same example).  However, birth records tie them to you, and ALL of your interests are cataloged and archived.

This is the part of what the US founding fathers had considered when it comes to human rights, so they set up structures to help avoid having something like this put into place.  Should you encounter an agent on the street, he would have no way of knowing who/what you are aside from what he could see with his own eyes.  

Forget the jewish issue.  What if radicals came into power that had some sort of hatred against gays, certain political or or other spiritual beliefs or other lifestyle choices.  Say, if fast food became a legal requirement, but you're caught looking up recipes.  What if working on your own car or computer became illegal?

It is a historical fact that laws change over time, and that, indeed, governments don't necessarily need laws to have some form of persecution.

Waves move across the sheet, like waves across the surface of water. These waves move from one side to the other, bounce off the far side of the sheet, and move back across. When the reflections match up - when a certain number of 'wave crests' fit across the sheet, they resonate. As these waves push the air around, they cause pressure waves in the air - sound.

The note, the tone, of these waves depends on how fast they move across the sheet. This is influenced by how stretched the sheet is. As the sheet wobbles, it is slightly stretched by a small amount. This slightly speeds up and slows down the waves moving across the sheet, making the pitch of the sounds they are making rise and fall. This is the 'wobbling' sound we hear.",eli5

Even a certified or bank check would take days to clear. The banks were basically making money off the interest while it ""floated"" in their system. I think regulators eventually stepped in, limiting the time they were allowed to float the funds.

Modern banking is much faster now and although there is obviously a certain amount of time necessary to validate checks and transfer funds I'd venture to say it's a fraction of the time they actually set aside. They're making money off your money (albeit at a pretty small interest rate).",eli5

5rcvvo,"Difference between effects of Norepinephrine and Noradrenaline? I know the details of the two, but what difference do they have in terms of effects on the body? Thanks ","Noradrenaline is the same thing as norepinephrine NE).  However, there is a difference between NE and Epinephrine. 

Basically NE acts on 2 receptors: alpha 1 and Beta 1. Alpha 1 increases your blood pressure without changing the difference between the two. So your BP can go from 120/80 to 160/120 (for example). Beta 1 increases your heart rate and cardiac output.

However, whenever your body notices an increase in BP, it'll automatically lower your pulse. This can cancel out the effects of beta 1, and you can see an increase in BP with no big change in pulse.

Epinephrine, on the other hand, can work on A1, B1, and B2 (depending on the dosages). Beta 2 actually lowers your diastolic pressure. So you can see an increase in BP (A1), increase in the change between the numbers (B2), and an increase in pulse (B1 + average number between the 2 doesn't really change so your body doesn't compensate).

Understanding these receptors allows doctors to decide what drug to give depending on the circumstances",eli5

5rrv9a,Why is Oman such a 'quiet' nation despite being right in the middle of chaos? ,"I should begin with the disclaimer that I'm not an expert in the subject. That being said, I do have a very strong interest in geopolitics and can hopefully provide a half-decent answer until someone better educated comes along. Of the top of my head, I can think of three potential reasons for why Oman is relatively stable compared to other Middle Eastern countries.

First, most Muslim states (in the Middle East and elsewhere) are either predominately Shia or Sunni. Oman is the one exception to this, as it is primarily Ibadi. As such, it has largely stayed out of Shia-Sunni conflicts.

Second, it has a relatively diverse economy, which means that it is more stable than if it was solely based on oil. You can also see this is the UAE (particularly in Dubai) and other areas of MENA with a diversified economy.

Third, I think that your original premise is based on a flawed assumption. You said that it's in the middle of chaos, but it isn't. Oman borders 3 other states: KSA, Yemen, and the UAE. Of these, Yemen is the only one that is currently undergoing significant strife.

- The extra fat in humans has a simple explanation.  We need the fat to fuel our brains and other primates don't. As our brains evolved through evolution, our fat storage did as well.
- Babies cannot naturally swim.  They are more buoyant, but that's likely due to them having more fat.
- It does not necessarily take environmental pressure to evolve.  There are many other explanations such as sexual selection (and even on land the environment was undergoing drastic changes from forest to grassland).  Plus, the evolution in our brain size was pretty slow up until we started using tools.  At that point it exploded likely because bigger brains allowed us to have better tools and better hand-eye coordination of the tools.
- Walking on two feet offers several advantages.  For one it's given us the ability to be one of the best long distance runners on the planet, which is important for hunters.  It allows our hands to be free to carry tools and infants (the latter of which is very important since as our brains evolved to be larger, we also had to evolve to have our babies born before being fully developed due to the larger size of their heads).
- I don't know what you mean about Dolphins not being adapted for an aquatic environment. Except for having to come up for air, they are perfectly adapted.  Many animals on land have coordinate to catch prey, does that mean they're not adapted to life on land?",eli5

3i76wa,"Why are the world's stock markets crashing? The Chinese market has fallen by 20% over the last week. The Australian market had its worst drop since the height of the great recession 6 years ago. European markets had their worst drop in 8 years. The NYSE is down 1,000 points in a week.

Did the world see this coming? Why did it start? Where did it start? 
","This is a really tough one to explain in ELI5 terms, but I'll do my best. In a nutshell, this started about 7 years ago when the 2007/2008 Market Collapse happened. Before I get to that though, lets look at the housing bubble for a moment. In 2003, housing really took off as an asset. Money was being used to inflate the housing market and create a massive rally in home prices to the point where everyone was taking out mortgage on homes that were out of their price range and mortgages were used to fund spending. People would borrow against the value of their homes because everyone thought home prices would continue to rise... until they didn't when credit stalled in about 2006/2007. When the credit markets froze in 2007, analysts and bankers began looking at what was causing the freeze and they realized that no one was buying or selling all the debt (mortgages, credit card debt, etc.) that was in the markets. As this freeze got worse, Bear Stearns collapsed under their own bond portfolio and Lehman Brothers tried to save themselves by raising capital. In September 2008, it came out that Lehman Brothers couldn't save themselves due to having a massive book of mortgage debt that was underwater and could not be moved. This left them in a load of hurt and started the crash in 2008. The Fed tried to stem this problem by instituting Quantitative Easing. When the Federal Reserve instituted Quantitative Easing, it basically created a policy where the Federal Reserve buys financial assets (think US Treasuries for example) from commercial banks and other financial institutions. This raises the the prices of those financial assets and lowers their yield. It also devalues the US Dollar by increaseing the amount of USD in circulation. Europe, Japan, China, Russia and Australia, along with dozens of other countries (35 I believe at last count), have, over the past few years, cut interest rates, devalued their currency in one form or another through QE measures, devalued their currency or used central banking intervention. This is important because cheap money means that debt is significantly easier to fund. 

This is important because central banking policies have a huge effect on everything. China, like the US during the housing bubble, has fueld its growth by using cheap debt to fund everything from construction to their stock market. This is important because many of the investment vehicles and opportunities that were offered to Chinese investors were fueld by debt and the opportunity to borrow funds for leverage. Many of these investments were made with borrowed money. The thing about borrowed money, or leverage, being used to invest in the Stock Market is that when you borrow money against your portfolio, you make what's called a Margin loan (a loan against stocks and bonds you already own). A Margin Loan can help you see increased returns and it can also magnify your losses. Most margin loans have a provision which requires more money to be added to an account in order to keep it above the minimum required value to have the loan. When the market goes up, it's no big deal. When the market drops, however, your portfolio loses money and you have borrowed on margin, you may be required to either sell securities to cover margin loan or wire in cash to cover the balance. A great deal of the Chinese investors were trading on Margin or invested in securities that relied heavily on margin lending, short selling or any sort of borrowing to fund them. When the market started to turn and drop in value, people were required to sell to cover their margin loans. This, in turn, forces a market sell-off. 

So back in June, there was a massive correction in the Shanghai Index and the Chinese Government interfered. They instituted controls that did, temporarily, tide things over, but temporary fixes never solve a problem. This crash highlights the break between the market and the rest the of Chinese economy. China does have some policy tools left in their arsenal, but this poses bigger issues, such as the fact that Chinese Manufacturing, a key indicator of the health of the Chinese economy, is at a 77 month low. This has a ripple effect in terms of how much China imports for commodities and exports in terms of final products. Although Foreign Investment (ownership by non-Chinese interests) in the Chinese markets accounts for less than 1.5% of the investments made in the Chinese Stock Market, a market crash coupled with significant slowdowns in Chinese manufacturing has sparked fears of a global slowdown. This leads to reactionary responses. A quarter of Australia's stock exchange, for example, is made up of Industrial and Mining/Minerals/Energy companies, all of which do business with China. How many companies on the various European exchanges do business with Chinese textile companies, manufacturing companies, etc. Burberry, for example, had their 2nd quarter order from China cut and revenue by about 10%. An African iron ore company had to cut it's entire dividend because it took a 61% loss in revenue due to a significant cut in its Chinese orders. Now the US falls because it's a natural link in the chain. China sees a decrease in manufacturing leads to companies in the US that subcontract to China to see a decrease in revenue because it has a slew of possible effects such as causing a product (such as an iPhone) to cost more to produce and eat away at the projected revenue from that item. It's all a ripple effect. 

So did the world see it coming. It depends on who you ask. ""Smart money"" has been coming around in the last few months to this. Places like Zerohedge have been discussing this for years. Other investors have been saying it for years. Some, like Cramer and Orzeman, have been spouting market growth and believe the bullshit they are feeding. 

That's as best as I can explain things without jumping into Shadow Banking, fractional reserves, the effects of import/export demand, and things like that. This is a very complicated topic in general because of how much crap there is interconencted between things.",eli5

17lyp9,Why does my computer drastically slow down after a couple years? ,"Think of the computer as analogous to a human body:

1. Every time you install something (a program, a game, a toolbar, etc), you are essentially giving it a piece of 'food'. *Unlike* a human body, though, your computer doesn't ""burn calories"". It just lets the food sit there, and it continues to grow as more and more stuff is installed. You are essentially adding an endless amount of ""fat"" that is being consumed, and so your computer slowly becomes less and less healthy. Not all programs are bad, but they *do* take up space and memory, both of which are vital.

2. *Uninstalling* software isn't the same thing as ""getting rid of it completely"". When you un-install something, it leaves behind tiny 'artifacts' that affect the way the computer runs. So even though you *think* you're giving it a good clean, there are lots of nooks and crannies that get left behind.

3. Computers 'age', just like humans. We often leave our computers and other devices running 24/7 - which isn't inherently *bad* - but, the more you use something, the more it starts to wear down. This has a direct impact on its ability to perform.

4. Another big consideration here is *perception*. We live in an amazing age where technology is *doubling* in performance every few years. It's not unusual to **think** that your computer has become a lot slower, simply because everything else around it has become a lot *quicker*.",eli5

72v1li,Why does near darkness seem to have a faint blue tint to it? ,"So this can go a few ways, so the biological standpoint...

Your eyes have rods and cones. Cones are what you used in normal daylight, and rods, which are far more numerous, are for low light. You then have 3 types, red, blue, and green. As they are hit, they show only those colors, much like a computer monitor, and your brain then compiles it and makes an image.

Those types also show in a certain percentage. Blue is the most numerous, then green, then red are the rarer of the bunch in your eye. So in low light, or almost no light, your rods are what get the signals. Since there's very very little light, the chances of a particle of light hitting the red rod is very small, since there are far fewer of them in your eye. But the chance of it hitting a blue rod are fairly high, allowing them to activate.

As well, cones work very quickly, but rods work slowly. This is also why it's not bad during the day, but if you are to go from a bright room to a dimlit room or vice versa, it takes a long time for your eyes to ""adjust"" to the light and you to be able to see.

As a fun fact, because of this, raiders would wear blindfolds or patches over their eyes during the day time, to allow their eye to be on a constant ""night"" mode since they did their raids at night. This is where the idea of pirates having eye patches came from, as they would do this and wear the patch to be able to see better during night raids. And as far as the red bit, is why the military uses red flashlights, as they are harder to see (again, fewer red rods, so less a chance of them turning on) and thus while they allow the person there to see somewhat clearer, the chances of them being detected by someone else is much lower. Adversely, blue lights are used for distress as they are easily recognizable and easier to find.

Hope that helps, and hope you got a TIL out of that all!",eli5

ajz5m6,"Why was Aristotle's successor, Theophrastus, not renowned as his predecessors? Aristotle was taught by Plato, who learned from Socrates There are major courses for philosophy of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, but few people can name the works of Theophrastus. Why were his works not as intellectually powerful or influential?","Aristotle et al. are famous because the books they wrote survived for thousands of years. Long after they died, copies of their books were made in libraries in the Middle East and studied by academics in Europe. This allowed their work to be shared widely, translated into many languages, and most importantly, preserved from destruction.

By contrast, we know very little about Theophrastus. According to [Diogenes](_URL_2_), he was a very influential philosopher in his time, and he wrote a massive amount of books on all kinds of topics. However, almost none of Theophrastus's books have survived to the current day. This means we don't know about most of his ideas, and most of the things we do know about him are from other people mentioning his work.

 > How far Theophrastus attached himself to the Aristotelic doctrines... can be determined but very partially owing to the scantiness of the statements which we  have, and what belongs to this subject can be  merely indicated in this place.  
 >   
 > [\-Dictionary of Greek and Roman Mythology](_URL_1_)

That being said, we do remember Theophrastus for his contribution in certain fields. He is considered the ""father of botany"" for his botanical books, *Enquiry into Plants* and *On the Causes of Plants,* which survived to the 15th century and were highly influential in the European Renaissance.

y591q,"Why do things like stone, cloth, wood etc. change colour when it comes into contact with water? Just something I've always wondered but never got around to finding out the answer.","When light hits an interface between two media, it has a chance of scattering. This chance is dependent on the angle of incidence (which we can ignore for simplicity's sake), and the difference in indices of refraction. The bigger the difference, the more scattering there is.

So when light hits the fibers in cloth, it scatters a lot, because fibre has a very different index of refraction than air. However, when the cloth is wet, light goes through 3 media instead of 2. First it hits the air/water interface - and the difference in indices of refraction is smaller here than between cloth and air - then the light hits the water/cloth interface - once again the difference is smaller. So the end result is that there is less total scattering, since each interface involves two media that is more similar in indices of refraction. So less light scatters off these surfaces and back to your eye, so the object appears darker.

This also means that more light is _transmitted through_ the material. This can be readily seen, and exploited, in wet t-shirt cont- uh... Go to bed, it's bed time.",eli5

Just like a car with a small fuel tank doesn't have less power than one with the same engine but a bigger fuel tank, so two batteries with the same type of fuel produce the same amount of power, but the one with more of this fuel lasts longer. 

So, as someone else said, you always want as much fuel as you can, but obviously having too much fuel makes your device big and heavy. So batteries come in a range of sizes so that manufacturers of devices can decide the perfect amount of fuel to keep their device running a long time without being too bulky and cumbersome.",eli5

Which processor is faster? an 8-core chip at 2.2GHz or a dual core at 3.8GHz. Answer: it depends. No hard disk box that I've ever seen gives a meaningful indication of disk I/O, and Intel graphics chipsets span the gamut between ""can't run Aero"" to ""if you're modest with your graphics options, you can probably play some 3D games acceptably"", with no easy way to tell besides researching benchmarks on the particular chipset a computer ships with.

Microsoft's intent by adding this hardware performance scale was to simplify comparing computer specs. Computer X costs $500, and has an average rating of 4.5. Computer Y costs $600 and rates at a 6.0 Computer Z costs $1,000 and ranks at 7.0. Even the least tech savvy consumer can see that spending the extra $100 makes a lot of sense, but spending $400 more than that is not nearly as worthwhile an investment.

5oih7r,How does internet banking works? Is there real money for every digital one? How did they start adding numbers to 'the system' or how do they manage to trade it? ,"No there is not a ""real"" as in physical dollar for everyone you bank online.

However that has little to do with the internet and stated long before we had online banking.

Money existed in theory only and without any physical coins or banknotes to back it up for long before computer banking came along.

This is how banks can lend more money to different people than they actually have in deposits.

The system breaks down when everyone who has money in the bank on paper (or digitally) wants their physical money at the same time, because there is not enough physical money for that.

In practice it is actually very hard to keep track of what ""real money"" is anyway.

Like how did they keep the red on the American flag consistent?,"The Pantone color matching system was the most common method.  It was created originally for cosmetic colors (vanity wins again!). The matching system was just a bunch of well controlled cards.  I'd have the cards, and you'd have the cards and then I'd describe my color/print/shirt/dye/whatever in terms of its relationship to these cards.

Edit: Clarifying a few things:

1. RGB is used for on-screen colors, not for dyes and inks (printing, etc.).  It is sometimes converted, but don't expect good results ;)  

2. I'm not interpreting this as ""how were colors standardized in the 1700s when we started making the american flag"", but interpreting it as ""how did we do it prior to RGB"" (which became popularized with computer screens).

3. If you want to go back further, you'll run into a variety of color systems.  In the 1800s you'll see the munsel color system, and other ""color wheel"" approaches that achieve the fundamental goal of ""color matching"".  Whether this was used in flag making or not is unknown to me, but I suspect that flag makers just bought ""red fabric"" from their fabric supplier ;)",eli5

1jrp78,Why do many R-rated movies only show quick flashes of nudity? ,"Film rating and classification groups (like the MPAA) take into account the duration of nudity when establishing an appropriate rating for a movie. 

Extended nudity (especially if the nudity is sexualized or presented in a sexual context) may result in a higher film rating classification (e.g. NC-17 in the US). Thus the nudity is presented relatively briefly (not in a pornographic way) as to keep the rating R or below.

Movie studios are very concerned about getting films rated NC-17 because it is very hard to make money when a film receives this rating. This is partly due to restrictions on advertising for NC-17 films, but also because many theaters and retail outlets will refuse to show and sell (respectively) NC-17 movies.

Note that brief non-sexual depictions of nudity can appear in films rated as low as PG, but most films depicting explicit nudity (e.g. bare breasts) are unlikely to receive ratings lower than PG-13 and in most cases will be rated R.",eli5

The idea is that eventually all nations participating will be part of all institutions, but many don't really want to join some aspects for one reason or another.

You have the EU and its various efforts like the Euro and Schengen and customs unions and other groupings that all have slightly different memberships and you have institutions like ESA which has many of the same members but is actually completely separate from the EU and you got dozens of other pan-european things like UEFA or Eurovision that have nothing at all to do with the rest.

It is complicated and any attempt to unify the whole mess has the obstacle that nobody can agree what the end goal is supposed to look like.",eli5
jw8ht,"The Mandelbrot Set, and why it's so significant. ","The Mandelbrot set is one of the most known fractal. A fractal is a mathematical object which is auto-similar: if you look a small detail of it, you'll find something similar to the whole picture. [This](_URL_1_) is a simple fractal. As you can see the construction method is very simple, but the result is quite beautiful. 

If you look a broccoli (or[ cauliflower](_URL_0_)), you'll find a fractal.

The math behind the Mandelbrot set is not too difficult. It simply involves sums and multiplication, then you color the point according to the result (operations among complex numbers, but easy). Yet it can create something really beautiful like a fractal. 

This is not the only important thing about the Mandelbrot set (fractals can be used in data compression, for example).
___
*This is the formula for the Mandelbrot set: Z(n+1) = Z(n) x Z(n) + C
where Z(0) = 0.*

*However, as you can imagine, you cannot do this math by hand. In fact, the first picture of this fractal was drawn using a computer in 1978.*",eli5

3g9vqd,Why are many female animals larger than their male counterparts but human males are larger than females? ,"It all has to do with how selective the females are for mates. Typically in mammals, the reproductive process involves really significant resource expenditures by the females. Plus, the amount of offspring produced in one birth event is relatively low. Cats will have maybe 4-10 kittens in a litter, dogs will have 5-10, and humans will have 1-2. Contrast that with a turtle who will lay 20-100 eggs depending on the species or spiders that lay hundreds. Mammals expend far more resources, time, and energy to produce fewer offspring, so the females are going to be very selective with the mates they choose. When competition among males for females is intense, the larger males will win the fight. As a consequence, animals with reproductive tendencies like mammals (high female selection, social animals, and extensive parenting), tend to have larger males than the females. 

As a contrast to that, animals who produce tons of offspring over a short period of time, expend less resources, and have low levels of parenting will have the females larger than the males. In these types of species, so many offspring are produced that there's little incentive for the males to compete with each other for females. Every male can get the chance to reproduce. Without a selective pressure for them to be large, they will be just large enough to survive to breed.",eli5

However, there are signs that trained investigators can read within the context of what burned.
Example: in an apartment fire, maybe they notice that the ceiling is more damaged in a corner rather than in the opposite: so it's likely that the fire started there. If there's an electrodomestic like a TV or a fridge, it's even more likely that the cause is an electric problem.
Petrol and chemicals leave stains on the floor, and if they find multiple starting points, an arson is most likely involved.

4dlq8d,What causes congestion delays on highways and interstates?,"In practice, the vehicles slow down more readily than they speed up.

This is due to partially to vehicle performance but primarily, it's the drivers.  Vehicles brake from 60 to 0 much quicker than they accelerate from 0 to 60.  Drivers are cautious, especially when they can't see farther than the vehicle in front of them and accelerate slower (or a moment later) than the vehicle in front of us and leave larger following distances between us the faster we go.

If all of our cars were hooked together train style and we all accelerated out of a congestion delay together, traffic would move quicker.

I'm curious to see how autonomous vehicles that can communicate, accelerate and decelerate together can change this.  Would a group of autonomous vehicles caravan together with very little following distance between them in a ""trusted"" group?",eli5

But this isn't the case because of the square-cube law. As it relates to tiny things, the smaller something is, the more resilient it is to stresses. 

What the law means is that as an object's surface area increases by a power of 2, its volume (and mass) increase by a power of 3. So something that gets a little bit bigger will weigh a lot more.

When a bug falls, it weighs so little with respect to its surface area that it has a really low terminal velocity, aka it will fall very slowly. Because of this in addition to how strong their little bodies are for their mass, they will land like nothing happened.",eli5

Why just personal stuff?","Amnesia is a very very broad term with at least 10 different types. Imagine asking: ""When people are robbed, why don't they have EVERYTHING robbed as opposed to just their cars or TV's?"".

Memories and knowledge aren't stored in a single place in the brain and are independent enough that they can be individually affected by trauma. Your 5th birthday is very different kind of memory than ""how to tie your shoes"" or ""Speaking french"". Trauma (physical or otherwise) may affect the parts of your brain that help make new short/long memories, or it might block certain memories from being accessed.

You can bruise your arm without bruising your shoulder. You can damage some of your brain cells without damaging others. Specific memories can be affected, or entire areas and the ability to generally create/access memories can be affected. 

It may only affect a specific portion of the memory creation process, leaving you unable to remember how/where/when you learned certain things or unable to remember faces anymore. 

you may only have a problem with creating NEW memories, or may lose old memories but still be able to create new ones.

It can be very short term such as severe concussions (Almost complete amnesia followed by rapid improvement), or very long term such as Dissociative amnesia from childhood trauma. You may have lost the memories completely, or they may still exist but you are unable to access them.
 
To reiterate, saying ""I have amnesia"" is like saying ""I hurt my leg"". It can mean any number of different types of problems.",eli5

 > Martial law is usually imposed on a temporary basis when the civilian government or civilian authorities fail to function effectively (e.g., maintain order and security, or provide essential services). In full-scale martial law, the highest-ranking military officer would take over, or be installed, as the military governor or as head of the government, thus removing all power from the previous executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.

 > Martial law can be used by governments to enforce their rule over the public. Such incidents may occur after a coup d'état (such as Thailand in 2006 and 2014); when threatened by popular protest (China, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989); to suppress political opposition (Poland in 1981); or to stabilize insurrections or perceived insurrections (Canada, The October Crisis of 1970). Martial law may be declared in cases of major natural disasters; however, most countries use a different legal construct, such as a state of emergency.

 > Martial law has also been imposed during conflicts and in cases of occupations, where the absence of any other civil government provides for an unstable population. Examples of this form of military rule include post World War II reconstruction in Germany and Japan as well as the southern reconstruction following the U.S. Civil War.

...

 > The martial law concept in the United States is closely tied with the right of habeas corpus, which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend habeas corpus is often equated with martial law.[citation needed] Article 1, Section 9 of the US Constitution states, ""The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.""

 > In United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.

...

 > Throughout United States history are several examples of the imposition of martial law, aside from that during the Civil War.

 > There have been many instances of the use of the military within the borders of the United States, such as during the Whiskey Rebellion and in the South during the civil rights crises, but these acts are not tantamount to a declaration of martial law. The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and military justice: deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and that is one of the keys, as the Supreme Court noted, to martial law.

 > **The American Revolution**

 > As a result of the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the Massachusetts Government Act, one of the Intolerable Acts, which suppressed town meetings and assemblies, and imposed appointed government, tantamount to martial law.

 > **New Orleans, Louisiana in the War of 1812**

 > During the War of 1812, US General Andrew Jackson imposed martial law in New Orleans, Louisiana before repulsing the British in the Battle of New Orleans. Martial law was also imposed in a four mile radius around the vicinity. When word came of the end of the war, Jackson maintained martial law, contending that he had not gotten official word of the peace. A judge demanded habeas corpus for a man arrested for sedition. Rather than comply with the writ, Jackson had the judge arrested.

 > **Ex parte Milligan**

 > On September 15, 1863 President Lincoln imposed Congressionally authorized martial law. The authorizing act allowed the President to suspend habeas corpus throughout the entire United States (which he had already done under his own authority on April 27, 1861). Lincoln imposed the suspension on ""prisoners of war, spies, or aiders and abettors of the enemy,"" as well as on other classes of people, such as draft dodgers. The President's proclamation was challenged in Ex parte Milligan, 71 US 2 [1866]). The Supreme Court ruled that Lincoln's imposition of martial law (by way of suspension of habeas corpus) was unconstitutional in areas where the local courts were still in session.

 > **The Great Chicago Fire**

 > In response to the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, Chicago mayor Roswell B. Mason declared a state of martial law and placed General Philip Sheridan in charge of the city on October 9, 1871. After the fire was extinguished, there were no widespread disturbances and martial law was lifted within a few days.

 > **Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 1892**

 > In 1892, in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, striking mine workers blew up a mill and shot at strike-breaking workers. The explosion leveled a four-story building and killed one person. The governor declared martial law. At the same time, a request was made for federal troops to back guardsmen. Over 600 people were arrested. The list was whittled down to two dozen ring leaders who were tried in military court. While in prison, the mine workers formed a new union, the Western Federation of Miners.

 > **San Francisco earthquake of 1906**

 > Following the earthquake of 1906, the troops stationed in the Presidio were pressed into martial law service. Guards were posted throughout the city, and all dynamite was confiscated. The dynamite was used to destroy buildings in the path of fires, to prevent the fires from spreading.

 > **Colorado Coalfield War**

 > In 1914, imposition of martial law climaxed the so-called Colorado Coalfield War. Dating back decades, the conflicts came to a head in Ludlow, Colorado in 1913. The Colorado National Guard was called in to quell the strikers. For a time, the peace was kept, but it is reported that the make-up of the Guard stationed at the mines began to shift from impartial normal troops to companies of loyal mine guards. Clashes increased and the proclamation of martial law was made by the governor, eventually resulting in the Ludlow Massacre. President Wilson sent in federal troops, eventually ending the violence.

 > **West Virginia Coal Wars**

 > During the events of the West Virginia Coal Wars (1920-1921), martial law was declared on the state of West Virginia. At the behest of Governor Cornwell, federal troops had been dispatched to Mingo County to deal with the striking miners. The army officer in charge acted, ostensibly, under the Suspension Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution (selectively; accounts show that he only jailed union miners), and did not allow assembly of any kind. If his soldiers found any union miners, they immediately took them and imprisoned them. The jails filled up so quickly that he had to release miners. As it went, miners were arrested, jailed, and released without any sort of trial. After a time, when the trial of Sid Hatfield began; the military occupation and ""veritable military dictatorship"" (Governor Cornwell) of the army officer ended. Many of the miners were not released from jail. It was only the first of three times that federal troops would be called to quiet the miners in the West Virginia Mine War.

 > **Tulsa Race Riot**

 > In 1921, during the Tulsa race riot, the Oklahoma National Guard declared martial law.

 > **San Francisco, California, 1934**

 > In 1934, California Governor Frank Merriam placed the docks of San Francisco under martial law, citing ""riots and tumult"" resulting from a dock worker's strike. The Governor threatened to place the entire city under martial law. The National Guard was called in to open the docks, and a city-wide institution of martial law was averted when goods began to flow. The guardsmen were empowered to make arrests and to then try detainees or turn them over to the civil courts.

 > **The Territory of Hawaii**

 > During World War II (1939 to 1945) what is now the State of Hawaii was held under martial law from December 7, 1941 to October 24, 1944, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.[30] Many Hawaiians were, and are, of Asian descent, and the loyalty of these people was called into question. After the war, the federal judge for the islands condemned the conduct of martial law, saying, ""Gov. Poindexter declared lawfully martial law but the Army went beyond the governor and set up that which was lawful only in conquered enemy territory namely, military government which is not bound by the Constitution. And they ... threw the Constitution into the discard and set up a military dictatorship.""

 > **Freedom Riders**

 > On May 21, 1961, Governor Patterson of Montgomery, AL declared martial law ""as a result of outside agitators coming into Alabama to violate our laws and customs"" which has led to ""outbreaks of lawlessness and mob action.""

2d7yiu,"How did people edit movies(add music, change sound, add effects, etc.) before the use of digital film and computer software? I know I sound really small minded, but I never thought about it before.","When I was in film school it was just before everything transitioned to digital. We would take a print of our raw footage (not the original negative, just a print copy) on Steenbeck flatbeds, physically cutting and taping pieces of film together to create a workprint. This workprint would obviously get beaten up, scratched, you can see the tape, you had to draw on it with grease pencil when you wanted a dissolve or a fadeout, and it was generally unfit for screening. 

When we were done, you would pay a person to go back to your original negative (the ""master copy"" of the unedited footage) and using a numbering system on the edge of the film, match the negative to your workprint to make a really pristine final negative cut of your film, which is then used to strike prints for screening. This negative cut used sophisticated gluing, etc to assemble the print, not crude splicing tape. The process is a bit complicated but it involves superimposing cuts in two ""A/B rolls"" and then using those rolls to create an interpositive, blah blah blah but at the end you get your final beautiful print with your edits intact. It is also at this point that dissolves, fades, and superimpositions were performed optically by the film lab. 

Negative cutting used to be a very lucrative and honored career, as it required total perfection with no safety net. Now with digital print striking it's not an issue.

As for audio, in school we used to transfer our effects (often located on 1/4"" tape reels) onto magnetic film, ie film stock coated with the same magnetic oxide that is on audio tape, and we'd use the same flatbeds to create our audio tracks, splicing stuff just like before. You would need ""picture fill,"" which was dummy film stock cut to the same shape as the mag stock that you would use for empty space. You play the workprint on the picture part of the flatbed and there is usually room for 1 or 2 tracks of audio on the flatbed to play at the same time (you'd sync them up at the beginning with the 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 countdown that's accompanied by an audio beep). This way you could time your effects to match your picture. It was weird because you had to plan it all out in advance, you couldn't actually hear all your effects at once until you put them all up in the mix on these big machines that could play 7-8 audio tracks at once (for our student films that's all we were allowed). And then you mixed them on big audio consoles that were remotely controlling all the mag players and there were machine room operators who were tasked with keeping everything in working order during the mix. Mixing consoles used to not have automation either, so the mixer would have to perform the mix life, and then punch in and out at quiet moments to redo things. It had to be subtle so there would be no audible click or pop at the punch in moment.

At the end you'd have your negative cut and your final mix on two separate rolls. You can then strike a theatrical print in which the sound is printed next to picture on an optical track that the projector can read while it's projecting your picture.

4c4a8i,"How did 16-bit platforming video games ""design"" parallax scrolling and perspective? Here's a [clip to Starlight Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog 1](_URL_0_) to help show what I mean.

The backgrounds - how did they design them to scroll like that?  I understand how perspective works... the layers closer to the foreground move faster than layers further in the back.

Go to the top of the screen - the rows with the stars are positioned closer to each other (to mimic flatness), whereas the rows with the city images are spread further apart.  Go to the bottom of the screen, the reverse happens.

What I don't understand, is how in the scope of the ""level"" is everything laid out  The map they designed on a single plane. Simple shit. How did they line up the playfield with the middle of the background - everything above are the repeating stars, everything below is the city.  How did they program/position all of the background layers?

How did they design this in the level editor?!?","I think this has to do with the capabilities of the video processor in use with such systems. Not everything on the screen is handled by the console the same way. For instance you have sprites, which can be moved around and animated, and you have tiles. 

There is usually a fixed number of sprites and tiles you can have on screen at any one time, and each color has to come from a pre-selected palate of colors, and there is a limit to how many colors can be on screen at once. 

Early 8 bit consoles had nothing that would prevent parallax scrolling but in order to do that you have to use the tiles in a different way which forces you to make concessions in the level design and sprite usage. 

For instance [Ninja Gaiden on the NES used parallax scrolling during some of it's famous cut scenes](_URL_0_)  like when NG goes into the rain forest, the background is different from the foreground. If you see that scene you will notice that the two backgrounds each have a strong color cast and the pixels are mostly the same color. This is because individually these elements are really limited in colors.

 One of the tricks they used to use to make the graphics look better is they would stack tiles and sprites on top of each other but each with a different pallets, which allowed them to have more colors. Since they were limited by the 256 tiles and 4kb of ram/rom to store all the background graphics, they had to be very careful with how they used it. This is one of the reasons why backgrounds were repeating patterns of very simple tiles. 


When we got to the 16bit era the graphics chips got more robust and they could handle more simultaneous colors, more sprites, more pallets, and more tiles at once. 

This meant they didn't have to combine things to make them look better as much, so they could afford to program different planes to move independently from each other instead of stacking them to add more detail to the level. 



So lets compare the NES to the Sega Genesis and you can see what I mean. 

NES PPU (Pixel Processing Unit) 

2KByte VRAM

8 × 8 or 8 × 16 (selectable) sized sprites

Two external 4 kB tile sets with space for 256 tiles each, usually stored in either RAM or ROM on the game cartridge

Up to 64 sprites (movable objects) on screen simultaneously (only 8 visible per scan line)

25 colors simultaneously (although more colors are possible using programming tricks) from a hardware color palette of 64 colors

Picture resolution of 256 × 240 pixels (fully visible on PAL, but cropped to 256 × 224 on most NTSC television sets)
._
._
._


Sega Genesis VDP (Video Display Processor)

64K Bytes of VRAM (32 times more than the NES)

64 simultaneous colors of 512 color pallete.

Pixel resolution: 320 x 224

80 simultaneous sprites

Maximum sprite size 32x32

3 Planes: 2 scrolling playfields, 1 sprite plane, 1 window plane





. 
.
.


So you can see that the Genesis had built in hardware support for multiple scrolling playfields, without needing  to use programming tricks like splitting the tiles up and reducing graphic detail to get parallax. It also had more memory it could devote to these tilesets than the NES 4kb. It also had a dedicated sprite plane for animated objects like the player, enemies, projectiles, etc.",eli5

97llez,"- Why does light / images bend or curve in the infinite void created when two mirrors reflect each other? I'm sure we've been inside elevators covered in mirrors on two opposing sides. Or perhaps in a bathroom. 

How come, when looking into these mirrors, the light or the images insite the infinite reflection loop that is created curves and eventually gets too small? ","Basically its because the two mirrors are never perfectly flat and parallel with one another. The slight difference (which is probably significantly less than a degree) is multiplied with every subsequent reflection, so it doesn't take many repeats (of which you can probably see 30-40 or more) before the difference becomes very noticeable. 

Plus, the mirrors don't reflect all the light. Even a very good mirror reflects only 95% of the light, so every reflection absorbs 5'% of the light. That's why it doesn't take very long at all before the image darkens to the point where you can't see anything.",eli5

If they target older PC's, then they can have a wider customer base, but their graphics aren't gonna be as nice, which means their screenshots won't look as good, which may mean the game will not sell very well (since unfortunately a lot of people judge games by their screenshots). Or they could decide to target newer PCs, which means the graphics will look great, but many people will have to upgrade their PCs to play it, and some people might not be willing to upgrade their PCs.

In contrast, you cannot upgrade an Xbox360. So the game-designers design the game to run perfectly with exactly that hardware. There's no need to make decisions about how powerful an xbox360 they want to support, since all the xbox360s are equally powerful.",eli5

Dolly was the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, however, her telomeres (sort of caps on the ends of a chromosome that control aging) where much shorter that normal, causing her to age more rapidly and die young.

1aqeon,"Why do farmers feed antibiotics to animals, instead of breeding them to become more resistant to disease? Wouldn't it make sense to breed the healthier animals, or animals that have stronger immune systems, so that a generation of animals comes up that is more resistant to disease/bacteria?

Why are they instead potentially breeding resistant bacteria by using antibiotics?","You cannot breed enough immunity into an animal that lives, eats, shits, pisses and drinks on a concrete or metal grate, squeezed into a crate, within immediate contact, at all times, with the next animal, living among hundreds of animals who are also living, eating, shitting, pissing and drinking on the same contrete floor or metal grate.  No animal could naturally survive in such an environment, so the ""farmer"" (I think ""meat manufacturer"" is a more accurate term, because these really are factories) must pump these animals full of powerful antibiotics to keep them alive long enough to be slaughtered.

To answer your second question - overuse/abuse of antibiotics in farms and hospitals are in fact creating resistant bacteria and that bacteria is killing people everyday in hospitals, especially the elderly.  Anyone who tells you otherwise, is either deliberately trying to deceive you, or is ignorant.  The reason they are doing this is simple: Profit.  Large Hog Confinements, for example, cost a great deal of money, but they are only profitable if they are run with the utmost sufficiency.  A medium sized farm probably employs at most five people - that's five workers producing literally several thousand head of hogs per month.

4jsnte,Why is a Root Canal preferable over say an extraction/implant? [This video](_URL_0_) shows the root canal procedure and it seems like at most 50% of the actual tooth remains after drilling the internal tooth/roots and making room for the crown. Why is this preferable over just extracting the tooth and replacing it with an implant?,"A root canal will remove the soft pulp and nerves from the inside of the tooth.  It leaves in place the roots of the tooth, which usually have an effective connection into the upper or lower jaw.  Filling in the void and crowning it is less invasive.  An implant involves pulling the tooth.  Then you have to deal with the void left by the missing tooth. Either you wait a few weeks for some bone to grow back into the void, or you wait several months if you need a bone transplant.  A bone transplant involves usually cadaver bone material to provide the structure for your own bone to grow around.  The cadaver bone has the remnants of foreign tissue excised, so the chance of rejection is minimal.  After that, the titanium implant is inserted (a screw that is hollow inside to accept the post that the crown fits over) and the bone must be allowed to grow and incorporate into the titanium.  Titanium is the best metal for bone to grow around and attach to.  One the screw implant is secured and fused with the bone, the post is placed and the dentist takes impressions for the crown, which then gets made and placed over the post.  Implants cost a lot more because of this.  It is not really advisable to try and do the implant and crown in a very short time frame, otherwise one risks damaging the weakened bone around the tooth socket.",eli5

3k570p,Why isn't Yelp in serious legal trouble after so many extortion accusations by different business owners?,"They have been sued in the past. The courts have decided that:

1) There is no proof that Yelp is *maliciously* deleting reviews or changing the ratings. (Yelp claims that it's simply trying to weed out spammy reviews and sometimes good ones get accidentally deleted).

2) More importantly, even if Yelp were maliciously deleting/changing reviews, it does *not* constitute extortion because Yelp is allowed to do whatever it wants on its site, including changing ratings. Since yelp is not writing its own reviews, libel does not apply here.

**Edit:**

Sorry for bringing up libel. IMO, it's not relevant to the central issue (whether what yelp is doing is  extortion). Defamation has a pretty narrow definition in court and websites like Yelp enjoy a lot of protection against those types of lawsuits. Deleting reviews to lower a rating does not fall under defamation, nor does paying people to write ""honest"" reviews.

As for extortion:

""Yelp adamantly denies giving its paying clients more favorable reviews, but even if such allegations could be proved, said the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, Yelp is entitled to set a price for its ads - and the **businesses reviewed have no legal right to a high rating.**

**'As Yelp has the right to charge for legitimate advertising services, the (alleged) threat of economic harm ... is, at most, hard bargaining,'** and not extortion or unfair business practices, Judge Marsha Berzon said in Tuesday's 3-0 ruling.""

What this boils down to is: Yelp has the freedom to filter the reviews on its website however it wants to. This right supersedes a business' right to a high or even fair rating. (Unlike mob extortion, as you have a right to health and property.)",eli5
1zuyf9,"Why, after eating spicy foods, my sphincter burns. I assume it has something to do with my body not being able to process capsicum, but I thought it would become neutral through digestion. ","Plants produce all sorts of interesting chemicals -- caffeine, nicotine, capsicum, the tropane alkaloids, etc. Most of the time, these chemicals are there to discourage or kill insects and animals that eat them.

Capiscum is an irritant -- most animals, when faced with something that burns when they eat it, are smart enough to stop eating it. Humans, on the other hand, keep eating the plants that hurt their mouths, and think that the hurting stops when the food passes into the part of their body managed by the Autonomic Nervous System -- the nerves that do stuff without you needing to think about it.

Imagine the surprise of these poor humans when they discover that their rectum is *not* the responsibility of the ANS, and that capsicum does not break down during digestion.

20gosk,Why do physics objects clip in games? ,"It's because the sprites (2d) and models (3d) that you see are the visual aspect of an object, while there is a background aspect of an object's size according to the computer. It's very painstaking and resource-consuming to create an exact replica of an object, so we use boxes or polygons to describe a more basic shape to the computer for it to work with. Sometimes we need more basic structures in order to keep processing at a minimum threshold.

Using these hidden boxes and polygons, we can get the computer to respond on collisions such as stopping at a wall. The more basic the computer's shape is, the less control you have over clipping into a wall or another object. There is the option to have an object have padding between itself and the wall as well. If you've ever tried to make a basic game before, you should have encountered this problem.

It ultimately depends on how much work is put into it. However it is necessary in some games such as MMOs because of you can't get past someone's character that's blocking a doorway then you could just be blocked out or harassed in that way (not to mention it's pointless processing).

5tyxfa,Why are some letters given different symbols depending on case whilst others are simply changed in size? ,"Upper case and lower case letters actually evolved from two very different versions of the Latin alphabet.

Capital letters have remained almost unchanged for 2,000 years, and [Roman inscriptions are still very easily readable today](_URL_2_) (if you know Latin). This version of the alphabet had lots of straight lines and wide curves, great for chiselling into stone. That's where serifs come from -- those extra little strokes in some typefaces like Times New Roman: a mason carving an inscription would chip out a line and then, to tidy up the end, turn the chisel 90 degrees and give it one last tap.

Lower-case letters came about from styles used when writing with brushes or pens. Straight lines were more difficult, so scribes developed styles with more curves, and those curves could become quite tight. Letter strokes could become longer and more graceful, and the characters could start to look very different from the original capital letters.

An example of this kind of script is [Carolingian minuscule](_URL_1_). For example, if you look at the ""e"", you can probably see that you get to it by writing an ""E"", but with the vertical stroke and the top and bottom stroke all combined into a single curve, like a ""c"", and then putting the middle stroke quite high up so it meets the top stroke.

Later, scribes started to mix these two types of script. To make important words and phrases stand out, they would carefully draw the bigger, blockier capital letters. To mark the beginning of a section, they would turn these letters into works of art -- [here's an example](_URL_0_). Over time, this became standard, and so evolved the convention of using initial capital letters to mark the beginning of a sentence and other important words, such as nouns. In most modern languages that use the Latin alphabet (as well as those that use the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets), most nouns are now written with lower-case initial letters -- with the exception of German, which continues the old tradition of capitalizing every noun.",eli5

They make less than in Canada, but for labor that requires true skill, they make a decent wage. That's why most of the really lavish spending - from corporate buyouts to tourist shopping - comes from China these days. China is increasingly not a terribly cheap place to live, compared to the West.

Anyway... people who have very low living costs are prepared to work for little money, because at the start, they just want to improve the situation they're already in. In Canada, your living costs are going to be high just because you need to have a car, a heated house, and food that's grown only in the summer and/or trucked in from far away. Somewhere like Bangladesh or Vietnam, unskilled laborers can live in poorly constructed shacks with no insulation or central heating, and they eat local food that grows plentifully and all year in that climate.

But wage demands constantly rise in those places anyway, which is why the real unskilled labor jobs are now moving out of China into Southeast Asia, and might move somewhere else afterwards.",eli5

3atw75,Why do some PC games have a 30/60FPS cap? ,"Hello, I'm a game programmer at an AAA studio.

The reason this happens is because it's easier to program a game that assumes it's running at a fixed rate than a variable rate. 

Every frame the game is doing a whole bunch of processing. It's simulating a tiny slice of time in the world and rendering all of the graphics. The amount of time that takes can vary depending on what's going on in world: how much stuff their is to simulate and render. 

In a fixed time step game you're going to say that each of those frames is going to simulate a specific amount of time, such as 1/30 seconds. To make this work you want the actual rate that the game is updating to match that exactly. If actual time is slower then the game will appear to jitter or run in slow motion; if actual time is faster then the game will seem to run in fast forward.

Games with a variable time step don't try to assign a fixed amount of simulation time per frame. Instead they will look at the actual time that passed since the previous frame and calculate how much time has passed, and simulate exactly that amount of time. (There's usually a maximum here, so if you're running very slow then you'll still get that jittery, slow-motion effect.)

Why is fixed time step easier for developers? Well for one thing, it's just plain simpler. You can decide that a car is going to move 1 feet per tick, and that's all there is to it. In a variable time step game you need to take the car's speed and multiply it by the amount of time since the last frame. The math is slightly more complex. To be fair, it's not incredibly hard math, and so this isn't really the #1 reason developers prefer a fixed time step.

Consistency is the real winner here. There's an entire category of bugs that can crop up with a variable time step that don't exist with a fixed time step. Usually these bugs arise when you forget to do the math correctly, or you make assumptions that break down when the length of an individual frame is too short or too long. (Physics code in particular can struggle with this, because the math behind game physics is already extremely complicated.) What's worse is that those bugs are often very hard to reproduce since they might only occur when the game is running at a very specific frame rate.

Variable time step also makes it harder to implement certain features. In particular playbacks. You might have seen films in games like Halo; it's actually fairly common for game engines to support primitive versions of this feature solely for debugging. A playback is usually just a recording of all of the inputs made to the game over a period of time, so that playing it back results in the same outputs. This is an invaluable feature for debugging, but you can imagine the problem with variable time steps - it's difficult to make the game actually run at the same frame rate as when the playback was captured. This can lead to inconsistent results and make it harder to get this feature working.

A lot of games end up doing a compromise where the simulation runs on a fixed time step, but the graphics code is allowed to run as frequently as possible. Typically in this setup, you have multiple copies of the game state, one for the most recently simulated frame and one for the previous frame. The renderer will interpolate the position and animation of all of the objects in between those, and can run as often as the machine will allow it to, but the simulation is still only updating at a fixed time step (typically 30 FPS.)

That's a good compromise, but it's a pretty complicated setup, and it requires your entire engine to be architected around that concept. It also requires more memory, since you need to have many full copies of the game state lying around. Memory was extremely limited in the PS3 and Xbox 360 era (especially on the PS3) so this approach wasn't favored in the console engines written at the time. Plus, on a console you can aim for a specific frame rate and if you can hit it on your devkit, you know that all the retail consoles will have the same performance. So most game engines written to target consoles just do the simple thing and try to target a consistent, fixed frame rate.

When you then port such a game to PC you have to make some hard choices. It's very difficult, expensive, and introduces a lot of bugs to rewrite the engine at a low level. Will the number of extra copies you'll sell by not being FPS capped justify that work? Those are the kinds of questions developers spend a long time thinking about when doing ports.",eli5

5twh76,Why has the Wild West been explored so heavily in films and television when it was a relatively short moment in human history? ,"Oh boy oh boy I got this. Gonna be wordy but I hope still ELI5.

Well the earliest Western cinema was contemporary. In fact the first ever film with what you might describe as a plot was a Western, centered on a bar room brawl.

As the *actual* wild west died off and civilization spread, it was in many cases a form of nostalgia, or for others a chance for increasingly button-down society to observe a time and place of rugged lawlessness. Like how well-off people from 1st world nations like watching escapist action movies about commandos kicking ass in southern Asian jungles or Russian bareknuckle fighting tournaments or whatnot.

In the 1930's, when movies were all gaining *sound* and directors began exploring what they could do with proper dialogue and sound, westerns fell out of favour with the mainstream for a while. Small studios just kept on churning them out and making a few little gems and lots of cheap crap. Why? Well they already had all the props, cliches and audience expectations of the past couple of decades, so they were so cheap and quick and easy to make but still made money.

In 1939 we hit a landmark. John Ford made Stagecoach. It's one of *the* most influential movies ever made. Orson Wells used to watch it over and over while he was preparing to make Citizen Kane and called it the perfect movie. As these things always do, everyone saw something get huge praise and jumped right back on the bandwagon. Or stagecoach. So the 1940's saw the western come right on back into popularity. It also helped that Stagecoach had an actor in it named John Wayne, who became wildly popular, to the point that he became an American icon for his roles in Western movies over the next couple of decades. The whole era is called the Golden Age of Westerns. Everyone was trying to top Stagecoach and building off of what it had done. It was a glorious time in its way, with tons of well regarded classics coming out in this period in this genre.

By the mid-50s though, the genre had gotten so popular that everyone was trying their hand, and as a result, the flood of movies led to stagnation. Most every tom, dick  &  harry who tried their hand at making a western ended up largely running on a really narrow set of tropes that celebrated the All-American Western Sheriff killing injuns and saving the good folk of the town through extreme violence.

So along came John Ford again.

The Searchers is a movie that just shits all over that idea. It deconstructs everything Ford and his imitators had built up, showing that archetypical sheriff, played by John Wayne or a John Wayne wannabe, to really be a xenophobic, prejudiced, violent shell of a man when you look beyond the thin veneer of ""heroics"" he performs. It was the beginning of the end for the golden era.

It staggered on for a few more years, until Ford once more shot the genre and finally put it down, with his movie The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Gritty, unpleasant, completely stripped of all the glamour and glitz of everything he'd done before. Intentionally returning to black  &  white even though it was 1962, no more beautiful outdoor vistas glorifying the setting, everything about it feels like Ford rejecting his own oeuvre. Being such an utter demolition of the genre, people couldn't just keep making movies like that afterwards. It'd be like trying to make an 80's slasher movie the year after Scream was released. It's a masterpiece that grounded the genre completely.

But of course, the genre, like an 80's slasher movie villain, somehow got up and staggered on.

Enter Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone. Some italians with no money and a guy known for a small part in a TV western series took inspiration from Japanese samurai movies and made something new and exciting. A Fistful of Dollars didn't give a crap about being realistic, nor about keeping all the trends of Hollywood's past 60 years of Western films, it was basically an opera of blood and bullets and by god people went ""HOT FUCK THIS IS GOOD."" As a bonus, it cost very little to make, being produced in Italy with landscapes in Italy and Spain standing in for Mexico. So that thing happened again where every copied it. For 20 years, so-called spaghetti westerns (and revisionist westerns in general) became an easy source of revenue for small studios to make money from. Leone and Eastwood made some goddamn art too, but for every Pale Rider there was a Django, nasty, brutal movies of desperation and squalor. Hell, when exploitation movies got big in the 70's, you bet your ass there were Western exploitation movies too (Django even being one in a way). You know how after Paranormal Activity came out and made a hundred million dollars from a few thousand dollar budget, and suddenly everyone was making found footage horror? Yeah, like that. Every hero an anti-hero badass cigar-chomping grizzled macho asshole who shoots first and asks questions later, if at all. Hell, Eastwood even turned the character into a contemporary cop with Dirty Harry, leading to the creation of that whole loose cannon cop cliche.

By the 80's, people started to get a bit bored of Westerns again, like they did in the 20's and 60's. This is getting a bit wordy now so let's just cut to the chase: Clint Eastwood made another of history's *greatest* movies, Unforgiven, and fucking murdered the genre again. Much like Ford showing how the classical western was often xenophobic and glamourized awful people, Unforgiven showed how the revisionist western glamourized violence, a eulogy for the genre having the final say on heroism, machismo and violence as a solution. There was nothing left to say after this.

So the genre sorta died finally in 1992. We're in a weird place now. People are still nostalgic for them, and there'll remain a place for them based on that alone, but nobody's having new ideas. Instead the last 15 years have seen attempts to bring back the classical feeling (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Appaloosa) or the revisionist feeling (Django Unchained, 3:10 to Yuma), but that's all they are. Fun echoes of what people used to make. We enjoy the violence and lawless badass antiheroes, or we enjoy the principled and strongwilled but willing-to-take-action sheriffs, or the beautiful vistas and ways of life of an America long gone. Take your pick.",eli5

It's always seen as more profitable to develop for consoles and port to PC. 

Others have mentioned things like DLC and I'd add preorders as anti consumer practices. The simple fact is for a huge portion of the player base these are not problems. Developed will keep doing it until its not profitable. At the moment its very profitable. 

One of the biggest advantages of PC is the mod scene. The problem there is companies have no incentive to support one. Look at a single player game like skyrim. Mods have kept that game alive for years, but the developed don't get anything from that. After they make a sale of the game they have no further interest in the user. Valve attempted to address the issue by providing an incentive for developed to make and support modding tools but the community recoiled in horror.

Thanks!,"An undervalued currency allows China to export more than it would normally be able to. A ""cheap"" currency makes its goods cheaper overseas, crowding out exports from other countries. As a result, China holds a trade surplus (exports > imports) while many developed countries (especially the US) have a trade deficit (import > exports). Countries with surpluses have extra income, while deficit countries must borrow. China is basically freeloading on the rest of the world to stimulate its own economy. 

tldr; China's undervalued currency creates a global trade imbalance.

1nvrdu,"Why do history textbooks dedicate specific sections to the roles of minorities and women at regular intervals. My cousin brought this up the other day, and it reminded me of when I was in high school, how every 20 pages or so, there would be a section talking about the role of women in the War of Spanish Succession or something, even though their role in the war was pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of European history. Why do all textbooks seem to do this?","History texts for most of human history have been a recording of the decisions and actions of the ""big people"" of history (who are almost always men, and in the last few centuries have been white men).

But, there is a good argument that an understanding of history has much more to do with the society that existed at the time than the significant *individuals*.  To put it another way: understanding the American Revolution does not come from understanding the founders, it comes from understanding American society at the time of the revolution which allowed to founders to do what they did.

Or, in the context you describe, that the War of Spanish Succession cannot be viewed solely as kings and queens directing the actions of their people, but as a matter of the people themselves.

Including information about women at the time, or minorities, serves the same purpose.  They *were* significant parts of society throughout history, and to the extent we have moved away from a conception of history focused on kings and queens, they are important to know about.",eli5
1coco1,"Why does only one side of the moon (nearly) always face the earth? Why does one side of the moon always face the earth? Is it a product of the way the moon orbits the earth (like, that side of the moon is 'locked' facing the earth), or is it just a big coincidence that the moon happens to be rotating almost exactly in sync with the speed that it orbits?",">  Is it a product of the way the moon orbits the earth (like, that side of the moon is 'locked' facing the earth)

**Bingo!**  You even used the right word: ""locked"".  The phenomenon is called [tidal locking](_URL_0_). 

 In a nutshell, since the gravity of the Earth affects the near side of the Moon slightly more than the far side, it causes the Moon to ""bulge"" slightly .  The Moon also does this to the Earth, by the way (more on that below), and the effect is more pronounced when applied to a liquid (like oceans).  On the Earth, you know these bulges as ""tides"".  

Anyway, if the Moon is rotating with respect to the Earth, these bulges (one facing the Earth, and one facing away) get pushed in the direction of rotation, and thus the moon feels a small torque acting *against* its rotation, since the bulges are no longer directly lined up with the Earth, and the Earth's gravity tends to try to pull them back in line.

This causes two things (or rather, one thing with two effects).  First, the Moon's rotation either speeds up or slows down depending on if it's rotating faster or slower than its orbital period.

Secondly, since the angular momentum of the system is preserved, the Moon will either move closer to the Earth (if it's being sped up) or farther away (if it's being slowed down).

This will continue until the Moon's rotational period matches its orbital period, and this is exactly what happened at some time in the past.

What's really interesting is that this also works in the other direction.  The Moon applies a small torque to the Earth in the same manner, which is still causing the Earth's rotation to (very, very gradually) slow, and results in the moon moving further away by a few centimeters every year.

Given enough time (I'm pretty sure the Sun will become a red giant and engulf the Earth before this could happen, though), the Earth would end up with its rotation matching the orbital period of the Moon, and thus the Moon would eventually appear frozen in one spot in the sky, with the same side facing us, forever.",eli5

7x2our,How did I get burned by superglue?,"Normally as glue ""dires"" it actually under goes a chemical change. This change is usually exothermic, meaning releases heat. The reaction rate is a function of several things but the main one in this case is surface area, as it reacts with air to cure. When on your finger the surface is at it normal so the curing happens slowly and the heat is released over a long period of time so you don't notice it. When applied to the tissue paper or other porous material the surface area exposed to air increases dramatically and the reaction rate does so as well. The energy is released much quicker result in hot temperatures and burns in your case. 

Edit fun story. Once for a project we mixing a bunch of epoxy. But someone put in way to much at once which lead to the epoxy getting too above 100C (212F) and steaming/burning the tables it was on. Again the reaction was exothermic but this time the contributing factor was temperature. They hotter the substance typical the faster the reaction occurs leading to a feedback cycle of the epoxy getting hot, drying faster and releasing more heat. We had to put the cup into a sink full of ice and later freezer to stop the runaway reaction.",eli5

63sd9l,Why are republicans and democrats so divided over health care?,"There are so many different questions broken down into your one question.

At the core, American value is still built on top of individualism. The prowess and success of an individual is celebrated. Like celebrating the star of the team more than the team itself. So at times, Americans can have a knee jerk reaction to something even remotely close to socialism.

One must also not discount the level of marketing and propaganda from the cold war. We were promoting the value of Capitalism vs Communism (which we conflated with socialism). So it became politically toxic to support something that resembled socialism.

Fast forward to now, insurance costs continue to rise as there is no natural cost control. There's no market force that restricts insurance companies from raising costs on the individual. This is possible because from region to region, there aren't a lot of competitors. Also if you by insurance on your own, it's more expensive than spreading the cost over a larger group of people.

In the 80s and 90s, I believe (could be wrong) there was healthcare reform to pool insurance groups together by the company they work for, by incetivizing  them to offer insurance benefits to full time employees and paying for part of the cost. This incentivized companies to seek out less costly insurance and negotiate down the prices by leveraging the number of employees they had. The cost would be spread over their pool of employees.

So this spread the cost of insurance over a group of people and maintained the private market for insurance. This was something of a compromise.

However, this left out unemployed, part time employed, self employed and people that may be too old or sick to work but to young for Medicare and perhaps too well off for medicaid. This left a gap of uninsured.  But these people. Don't just stop getting sick or injured. They still went to hospitals and doctors still had to treat them. But of course these people couldn't pay for treatment. This meant doctors and hospitals would have to raise their prices to compensate for the uninsured they'd have to inevitably serve. This meant more cost for insurance companies who'd spread the cost down to the employees that paid into it.

So we have a breakdown.

Many democrats were advocating for a government option of insurance and others a single payer system spread over the entire population.

Republicans opposed this idea, fearing this would raise taxes, cause a breakdown in beuracracy and force insurance on those who didn't want it. So they actually formulated a plan that formed customized markets for people that weren't covered to buy into. In one way or another they'd be required to buy insurance from a selection of companies. This would be a pool of people to spread the cost of insurance and try to lower cost. If everyone got insured, doctors should lower prices. Lowering costs for everyone.


Eventually, centrist democrats usurped this plan and combined it with the possibility of a government option to further lower costs. They also wanted to institute regulations to require insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions, lower cost of insurance for women, and allow children to stay under their parents insurance longer. This was because the parents were likely insured by employers and their adult kids may be in college. 

With the election of Obama, however, agreeing with anything he offered became politically untenable for Republicans. They vowed to oppose everything he offered in legislation. Further, they didn't want him to get the political points of 'fixing' healthcare. Lastly they had decently principled concerns about raising taxes to pay for extra costs, forcing people to be insured, and some of the mandates and regulations like covering pre-existing conditions and adult children.

Democrats attempted to compromise by throwing out the possibility of single payer or a government option. Still, Republicans didn't bend. Eventually, democrats resorted to legislative tactics to get around the Republicans and pass it without their help.

Here's where the problems came up. Because of all the wheeling and dealing and accommodating everyone's interest in Congress, there are some flaws to what Obama passed. Still, not everyone is insured, so the cost didn't lower as much as it could. Some of the offered plans were less desirable them plans found in full time employment options. Some insurance companies started backing out of these public markets because it wasn't profitable enough for them.

And most importantly cost didn't come down. Because not everyone is insured, the costs of drugs and treatment didn't lower, not enough people are employed, employee options became less desirable as companies seeked cut costs and lastly insurance companies still have a profit incentive to cut costs and still didn't have more competiton to lower costs.

Republicans tried to completely blame the flaws on the regulations and taxes instituted on the plan. When they got in office they essentially offered a plan that would revert us back to before Obamacare. Nothing to make sure everyone got insurance, no competiton for insurance companies, less requirements for the types of coverage  insurances companies had to offer to encourage them to get back into the markets.

Yet, this wasn't conservative enough for right wing republicans and it was completely unraveling Obamacare so democrats refused to be involved.

Now you're seeing more liberal democrats revert back to the original call for single payer health care to allow everyone to be insured and spread the cost over the entire population. Also their would be no profit incentive and you'd pay through taxes. So the less you make, the less you pay.

Republicans oppose this because they don't want to be taxed to pay for those who can't pay and they are distrustful of a government run system.",eli5

395lfa,"Why is a 'C' grade in American universities around 70-80%, where a 'C' grade in UK-based universities are around 50-60%? ","I will explain it from the view of a UK student. I study law as an undergraduate and for me the grades do go 70% for an A, 60% for a B, 50% for a C, and for a pass it is over 40%. We tend to refer to A grades as '1st class', B grades as 2.1 class, C grades as 2.2 class and D grades as 3rd class. I've met a lot of American and Australian exchange students here and they were confused as to why the grades were 'so low'. The truth is that it's very very hard to get an A here. 70% may not sound like a lot for an A, but it is quite difficult to achieve. In my degree, maybe only 10% or less get that grade (in one class, only 1 out of 100-110 students managed to achieve it.)

Kind of think like this. An A should be reserved for 'exceptionally good' work. Work with very few mistakes, well written, supported with lots of academic writing and examples, well analysed. A B is very good, few errors, etc. and it goes from there. Very few students will get A's. 

If you follow the lectures, go to tutorials, do all of your recommended reading and keep up with the course, You might get a low B or high C. An A is for people who do that little bit extra. That extra reading, that extra research, that extra effort and analysis. 

I have experience of (EDIT: and lived with!) American students who came here in exchange and were used to getting maybe A's or a few B's at home, so they thought it would be the same here or easier due to our lower percentages for grades. Actually they ended up getting mostly C's or struggling to pass. They had to work very hard to get below what they were receiving at home. Basically, it's difficult to get the high grades here (especially in essay based subjects like law, English or history.). They tended to struggle with most or nearly all of the grade based on one final exam, as well as harsh markers and the very high standard expected. We also do less grading on a curve for some reason - professors seems good at estimating the required standards for an A (very high), B (high), etc. and similar numbers of students get A's and B's each year, despite grade boundaries staying the same.

I should also explain it is very hard for us to do anything for extra credit, and the 'finals' for my courses actually counted for around 70-100% of my grade so we do less coursework and continual assessment (does depend on your degree though.) Also, UK universities don't tend to have GPAs. You guys need your A's and B's to maintain a high GPA. 

In the UK, we get a degree classification. An A average is a 1st class degree (between 10-20% of people achieve this depending on the course) B is a 2.1 degree (not sure how many people get this grade, but it is usually the grade you need to get a graduate job), C is a 2.2 degree and D is a 3rd class degree. So our grades and testing kind of works out a bit differently? Also, usually first year DOES NOT COUNT towards your overall degree class. In Scotland, the first 2 years (out of 4) tend not to count for degree class

This is just the general system here though. I go to a very good uni, so the standards are very high here. I also do one of the more competitive courses. I know other people at different universities who seem to find it easier or people on different courses who have less work to do. Additionally, some courses might vary their grade boundaries or methods of assessment. This is just a general overview!

TL,DR: Whilst the percentages required for grades seems low, it actually works out just as hard or even harder to get these grades than in America. Our grading and classification system is also different (no GPA). May be due to courses being harder in general, or stricter marking, or just a different system.

If I just drove my car away without paying them, would I have committed a crime (besides trespassing), even though I was only taking back a car that I already owned?","Cop here. The tow company needs to cite a legal authority to tow the vehicle (usually a subsection of 22651 cvc in california).  After they tow it, you need to pay them for the tow and storage.  If you take your car without paying you are probably going to be charged with burglary or theft.  Not theft of the car...since you own it but theft of services.

Edit: This blew up a little bit so I'll summarize a few of the other points that are made.

1)  There is a big difference between a public tow and a private property tow.  Public Tows (such as police or code enforcement) can only take place on public land or roads.  They always generate paperwork and always require some kind of authority that is specified in the Vehicle Code.  A Private Tow takes place on private property at the request of the owner or their agent.  An example of a Private Tow is if you have an assigned parking spot in an apartment complex and someone else is parking there.  Private Tows **should** have some kind of local authority but they don't always.  **Ninja Edit**:  The city can tow a vehicle on private land if it impedes emergency functions (such as fire hydrants).

2) In most states, a Tow Company cannot hold your car hostage for most Private Tows and some Public Tows.  If you take your car out but do not pay the bill, they can and will eventually send it to collections.  Check your local laws.

3) The Tow Company does not always need your permission to tow your vehicle.  There are various state and local authorities that give them permission to tow the vehicle at the request of the land owner.  Police Officers always need to cite the specific ordinance and generate paperwork.

Sometimes I'll feel more tired or I'll just feel really gross (Like I desperately need a shower). It seems like it also affects my mood: sometimes I'll be angry and grumpy, sometimes I'll wake up feeling lonely and feel like I need to socialize. Also, when I wake up from naps sometimes I just jump up without really ""waking up"" if you know what I mean. It'll be very sudden but I won't be startled or woken up by anyone/thing. Is there a reason for all of this?

1jevzo,How are allergies developed and why aren't there any cures for it? How are some people allergic to the sun or some type of food and what exactly happens? Why aren't there any cures for it except allergy medicine that only helps the symptoms ?,"Some people have what we call an 'atopic phenotype'. Simply put, these people have this overreaction to harmless things in the world like dust mites, pollen, milk, peanuts etc.

What happens is the body sees this new molecule for the first time and thinks ""Ok, this isn't part of my body, it must be bad"" and it primes these cells that control inflammation, called mast cells. Essentially they are locked and loaded, ready to fight off the particle the next time the body sees it. This is known as Sensitization and is the first step in allergy formation. Its also the reason why sometimes people with allergies can eat a certain food once and be fine, but every time from then on get a reaction.

The next time the body sees this particle these mast cells release all these lovely molecules like Histamine that cause the area to get all inflamed (red, itchy, swollen and hot). This is the basis of allergy medication, they are anti-histamines and they stop histamine from causing all this inflammation.

With regards to the Sun allergy it works in a very similar way, but instead of the causing factor being a dust mite or pollen, it is the UV rays in sunlight. To be honest it isn't very well known what causes sun allergy but its thought that the UV rays somehow change something in the skin which then is detected by the immune system.

Now about a cure...there actually is one. Its called 'desensitization', and has been used with various degrees of success. It involves stopping the immune system of the body having this over-exaggerated response, however it takes a long time (3-5 years) of treatments, which can be quite costly. Also it isn't extremely successful. 

Hopefully this made sense, if you have any questions feel free :D I can also go into more detail if you'd like, I literally just studied a lecture on this (source: medical student)",eli5

We know that part of the reason why galaxies are moving away is because spacetime is expanding. The redshifted galaxies led to the big bang theory. If the galaxies at far distances are moving away from each other now then at one point they were probably much closer than before. 

The acceleration of the expansion of the universe is what we do not understand yet. We know that it is happening because of the redshift of supernovae. We don't know what is causing the acceleration so we assigned the name of dark energy to it until we can identify it.

Dark matter is the unknown matter that is keeping individual galaxies together.",eli5
av1dwd,- Why did Windows just need an hour and a half to update? What takes so long?,"Actual five year old explanation: Windows is broken up into lots and lots of small play blocks that are sometimes stacked on top of eachother. Moving a bottom block, which is usually the most important because of its support to the tower, would cause it to fall over. Instead, a new block is pushed in to its place while the old block is taken out, fixed, then put back in.

 & #x200B;

ELI5 typical manlet understanding of computers level: All of these comments have been hooplah, and stand no actual basis to how the patching process in Windows ACTUALLY works. To begin, Windows first has to move sections of System32 to a backup partition on disk called ""System Reserved."" It does this to then apply a delta change between the old file and the new file. Several hash calculations are then done to cross-check the patch was successfully applied and that no malware is in the way manipulating the patch process. It then has to replace these files after taking down a lot of the system components, like the Capcom and WinAPI. Once all of these are unloaded, it can then replace the files, then put then stand them back up, then the actual reboot process is put into place. Sometimes critical sections of the kernel have to replaced, and this requires a bootscript. That's why sometimes the machine has to reboot several times. The reason yours is taking so long, is usually due to your NTFS journal being corrupted/useless and Windows has to reconstruct it.",eli5

What does that mean? 

If you have a signal that goes up and down in a rhythmic fashion, that's a wave. If you can transmit a wave through FM, then you can transmit sound (sound being a wave, of course)

It is a balance thing. As you know from Newton's Third Law of Motion every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so when you push your leg out in front of you it also pushes backwards on your torso an equal amount. That would tend to cause our torso to rotate back and forth which is an inefficient and awkward movement, throwing off following strides. Instead by swinging our arms the opposite way we can counteract the movement of our legs and keep our torso facing forward.

Note that you are swinging the arm opposite the movement of the leg on the same side. Try swinging your arms in sync with the leg then observe how your torso moves and your stride changes.",eli5

There are almost innumerable factors associated with crime rates, that to try and pin the rise and fall on any one metric is impossible. 

As a gun control person, I don't believe gun ownership to be a significant impact on crime rate in general. I believe making it harder to obtain weapons would make it more difficult for mass-shootings to occur, but I can't support that.

I've always wondered what about alcohol makes it evaporates so quickly, and where the fumes go--do they just mix in at the same weight as the rest of the air, or do they float to the ceiling or sink to the floor? Etc. 

Thanks","In order to turn into a gas the molecules held together inside a liquid have to break free to get into the air.

This is done by adding energy to the liquid. Heat for instance. The temp needed for rubbing alcohol to evaporate - or boil - is much lower than water, for instance.

And the fumes of rubbing alcohol are about twice as dense as air. So they would sink to the floor, but generally mix easily with other gases.",eli5

3b87ai,Why doesn't breaching the enemy line just turn that enemy line into a pincer movement? ,"Sometimes it can.  Sometimes breaching the enemy line in one area, but not routing the enemy, creates what's called a [salient](_URL_0_).  This is a ""bulge"" in the front lines, where you are facing the enemy on three sides.  There are books and books and books written on the mechanics of attacking or defending a salient.

This doesn't happen always, though.  That's because an attack strong enough to breach the enemy's line is probably going to throw the area into chaos.  The enemy forces directly in front of you are either destroyed or running away.  This leaves their neighbors on either side of you.  We'll say that General Bob is commanding them.  The difference between how your troops act, and how Bob's troops act, determines how well your attack/breach will develop.

If your troops can quickly funnel through the gap in the line you've just opened, they can turn sideways and crash into Bob's flank.  If Bob is not ready for this (if, say, he's tangled up fighting another unit, trying to prevent them from breaching the line in his sector), then you have ""outflanked him"", and you can ""roll up"" his flank, routing his unit and widening the breach.  Turning your troops to roll up the flank of neighboring units after breaching the line is called *exploiting* the breach.  

Alternatively, instead of turning to roll up Bob's flank, you can send your troops straight ahead through, completely passing through the front lines and leaving them behind.  This puts your entire unit in comparatively lightly-defended enemy territory, where you can wreak havoc on Bob's rear areas: supply bases, communications systems, etc.  Without his rear support, Bob will be forced to retreat from his fortified front lines, and you can then catch him out in the open.  Penetration of the front lines in this fashion became known as *blitzkrieg* when the Germans did it in WWII.  Later, it became a staple of Russian/Soviet warfare, known as [*deep battle*](_URL_1_).

All of this, though, assumes that your forces, after the breach, are more fit and mobile than Bob's forces.  That may not be the case.  If Bob is fast enough, or if your troops exert all their strength opening the breach and can't continue, then Bob can send his forces straight into your flank.  Likewise, Bob's commander may have other units waiting in reserve for just such a situation, and will send them straight at the breach in a counter-attack.  If you're not ready for this, your troops can be forced right back out of the breach they just made.  This was a common situation in the trench warfare of WWI: an attack might capture the enemy's first trench line in an area, but it would quickly be pushed out by a counter-attack, leaving no net change of territory.",eli5

19hf1s,why does my car often make a loud screeching sound when I turn the steering wheel? Can I fix it? ,"Likely causes, in order of how easy it is to fix:

1)  You're low on power steering fluid.  Buy a bottle (less than $2 at any auto supply shop) and fill the tank labeled power steering to the appropriate line.  Do not try to ""change your own power steering fluid"" like someone suggested--just fill it to the line.

2)  Your belts have become loose as they stretch with age.  You can tighten this (as someone else suggested), but every car is different.  You may be able to find a how-to on YouTube.

3)  You have a belt and/or pulley that needs to be replaced.  This is more of a chore, but again depending on the car you may not have much trouble doing it yourself.

Edit:  It could also be your power steering pump, but this is not very common.  Replacing a serpentine belt is such a chore that it is often recommended to change several other inexpensive parts (varies slightly from car to car) while you have things taken apart.  Check your service manual, but don't be surprised when your mechanic brings this up.  It might be $700 to get all the work done--but $500 of that will be labor that you would have had to pay regardless, so you're not going to save much by not replacing them, and if one of them breaks in 6 months you'll have to fork over another $500 in labor to get it done.

Also this is assuming your noise is a squealing/screeching noise.  If it's more of a creaking/groaning it could be a problem with the front-end suspension.",eli5

yvqmn,Why are people (and governments) against Euthanasia? ,"Euthanasia is generally defined as the painless killing of a person who is suffering from a condition that is not only extremely painful but incurable as well.  

Many people take issue immediately with the idea of killing, regarding it as morally/ethically wrong under any circumstances.  It is thought of as a violation of the sanctity of human life, going against god's wishes, etc.

There is the argument that there are other options-- pain and suffering can be treated in palliative or hospice care-- and that new treatments may be developed before a person succumbs to their illness.

Others point to the slippery slope argument, proclaiming that if the practice of euthanasia is introduced, soon its definition will be expanded so that people can be euthanized without having an incurable condition or without having a severely painful condition.  Furthermore, they point out that while it may initially be practiced as voluntary euthanasia-- in which the patient expresses a desire to die-- it could soon lead to involuntary euthanasia in which people who may not want to die are put to death against their wish.  As an extension of this, I've seen other arguments like that of medical cost-control: if someone has a health condition that is becoming unmanageably expensive, the problem could be solved via euthanasia.

From a doctors perspective, many may consider euthanasia antithetical to the Hippocratic Oath they made when entering the profession.  While some physicians consider their role to be one of doing what is in the patient's best interest-- and in some cases this may mean euthanasia-- others believe in a more strict reading of the oath.  They believe that a doctor should do no harm to a patient, including administering a lethal dose of drug that a patient may request.",eli5
