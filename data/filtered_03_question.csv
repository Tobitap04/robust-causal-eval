Also, it is relatively easy to gain 100 pound of fat as opposed to 100 pounds of muscles which is nearly impossible.

During later development when genitalia is specialized, your assigned sexual organ develops, but your opposite genitalia doesn't disappear. (For men, this vestigial organ is the vagina masculina, and women have a clitoris.) So it's the same with nipples.

wsn7c,"Why does a penis shrink in cold water? I know this may sound funny to some and immature but I've always wondered why. 

(Update)
Our human body is composed of water for the majority, and when water freezes in expands. How come it shrinks when it's in cold water?","Penis size is regulated by blood flow into the penis.  The mechanism behind an erection, for example, is pretty much just an increase in blood flow to that part of the body.  This causes the penis to expand much like a balloon when it's filled with water.  In other words, there is a relationship between blood flow and penis size.

Heat regulates blood flow.  When the temperature is low, the body undergoes vasoconstriction, the constriction of the tubes that carry blood throughout the body.  By making these tubes smaller, less heat is exchanged between the blood and the outside environment, so the blood stays warm.  However, vasoconstriction also decreases the blood flow to the penis, which as explained in the first paragraph, affects size.",eli5

They reach sexual maturity quickly, mate, have many many offspring and then die. Elephants take years to mature sexually, and trade-off for their long lifespan by having only one offspring (rarely two) at a time. Of course there are other characteristics to consider (size like you mentioned, large animals trade off for the size by having a small amount offspring and vice versa, the amount of time parents spend nurturing the offspring, etc).

People sometimes prefer to invalidate whatever made them agree with the disliked person because it's less of an effort than changing your mind about someone you don't like.

Also, if you've decided for any reason that ""person X is bad"", you can set yourself up so that anything X does or thinks *has* to be bad, by judging the actions/thoughts based on who performed them, instead of judging the actions or thoughts independently. That's also a mechanism to keep things consistent and make decision-making about a person ""easy"".

bdxm2z,"Why is an orgasm such an intense, pleasant feeling?","The brain (and consciousness) has evolved to be a sort of feedback system that has helped to improve the success of an organism/species as a whole. 

Imagine the brain as the principal of a school. The students perform there work, either poorly or well. This is analogous to an organism doing something, either helpful or not. The teachers (or certain receptor types) “appraise” the students work and report it to the principal. The principal uses this information to decide how to do its job; if a student is struggling (ie. a behavior is unhelpful/harmful to an organism) the principal will “try something new”. Perhaps the principal will talk to the student and identify the source of the issue and figure out what s(he) can change to improve the student’s performance. Similarly, the brain processes information about a harmful act and sends signals that are perceived as pain. This motivates an organism to change what it is doing and try something else. 

Something like having an orgasm would be extremely helpful in passing the genes on to the next generation so the brain has evolved (over a long period of time) to release large amounts of dopamine (the reward neurotransmitter) when an organism does it. 

For your question about if someone was “wired wrong” if they could feel the opposite; this would be incredibly unlikely to occur. The DNA that encodes an organism is very precise. In order for someone to develop with their nerves “hooked up to the wrong sources” (for lack of a better explanation) there would have to be MAJOR mutations of the DNA. If this were to occur, there would almost certainly be many other regions of the genome that would be completely destroyed and the organism would be non-viable.",eli5

195pw7,"How come an ant can fall 20 times its body length and end up unharmed, but people can't? ","The square-cube law.

If you imagine a standard person — say six feet tall, 180 pounds — and scale that person down by a factor of two, how tall will that person be? Three feet, obviously, because he's half as big as he was.

But how much will he weigh? If you guessed 90 pounds, you'd be wrong. The answer isn't *half* of the guy's original body weight, but *one eighth* of it, or just twenty two and a half pounds.

And that's just for a factor of two. Scale that person down by a factor of 100, and you get a person who's three-quarters of an inch tall, but weighs only as much as a grain of sand.

When you sneeze and that little guy flies out of the palm of your hand and hits the floor — a drop of let's say four feet — he will hit the ground at about ten miles an hour … but since he only weighs as much as a grain of sand, the force on his body when he comes to a stop would be … meh, I'm too lazy to do the arithmetic in my head, but it'd be very small indeed.

Force is mass times acceleration, remember. When mass is small, force is small … and as *size* — linear size — goes down by a factor of two, mass (for constant density, which is a fair approximation) goes down by a factor of *eight.*

238n4y,"Why do we change our heating/cooling inside our homes? 65° during the summer feels great, but it is freezing in the winter. I am not talking about when we first enter the room, but rather being stuck inside the house for hours.","Radiation.  There are two types of heat transfer at work here: convection and radiation.  Convection is heat transfer via a moving fluid (literally conductive advection).  When you change the thermostat setting, you are changing the temperature of the air and therefore the heat transfer between you and the air.

However, all matter hotter than absolute zero emits energy as radiation, with hotter things emitting more radiation.  All matter is also constantly absorbing radiation that was emitted by other matter and it can be thought of as heat exchange between two samples of matter.

So what does that mean?  Well, you are constantly exchanging radiation with the walls of your house.  The outside temperature will change the temperature of your walls, even with the heat or AC running.  This is especially noticeable in concrete or cinderblock buildings; even if the room is comfortable, if you touch the wall during winter it will feel very cold.  So in the summer the walls are hotter and therefore radiating more heat than in the winter, but your body is a constant temperature and radiating a constant amount.

Put it all together, there is a certain amount of net heat transfer that is comfortable (i.e., perceived as a comfortable temperature).  That certain amount is a combination of convection with the air and radiation with the walls.  In winter, the radiation is lower, so you increase air temperature to compensate.  In summer, the radiation is higher, so you decrease air temperature to compensate.

2sl8ob,"Why do tractor trailer trucks need 18 large wheels, but very large planes only need 6 small ones? ","Trucks drive a lot of miles and weigh a whole lot, so their weight needs to be distributed.  Otherwise they're causing a lot of wear on the pavement.  Virtually all wear and tear on highways is caused by trucks, so spreading out the load is very important. Planes only ""drive"" a short distance on pavement, so there's less infrastructure being damaged by having the load more concentrated.  

Additionally, putting more tires on a truck is fairly cheap (you have a nice rigid frame to bolt the axles to) and can make the truck safer (losing one tire out of 18 is relatively minor; losing one out of 6 is a bigger deal).  By comparison, putting more tires on a plane means that you increase the weight by quite a bit.  Losing a tire on landing is pretty inconvenient, but there aren't other planes out there that you're going to hit if you get a flat, so the safety issue is less present.

Then you look at the life of tires on trucks versus planes.  A truck is looking to drive thousands of miles before they have to replace their tires, so you want to have lots of tires to reduce the wear and spread the load.  A plane would ideally like to do a couple hundred landings on a set of tires, which is likely under 1000 miles all told; some planes may only do 10 landings on a set of tires (looking at you, SR-71).  It's OK to have to replace tires all the time on a plane since carrying around more tires would cost even more.

Finally, note that while planes are larger than trucks they aren't *that* much heavier.  A truck may be 100,000 pounds, all told, while a 737 (6-wheeled aircraft) maxes out at about 150,000.  Meanwhile, *very* large planes like the 747 have far more wheels—18 for that model.  The C-5 Galaxy has 28 wheels.  The An-225 has a whopping 32 wheels.",eli5

bqx98d,Why doesn’t the water in lakes and rivers get absorbed into the ground? ,"Some do lose water due to seepage. They lose more or less depending on what kind of rock and sediment lies beneath the lake. A rocky bottom holds water better than a sandy bottom.

Lakes are also subject to evaporation from their surfaces – especially in a dry places – for example, the American West.

So why don’t lakes just dry up? Some do. For a lake to keep its water over time, it has to be replenished. There are both natural and man-made lakes. The main way that water gets into reservoirs and man-made lakes is from the rivers and streams that were dammed to create them. Like man-made reservoirs and lakes, natural lakes may also be replenished by rivers and streams.

Natural lakes have another advantage, when it come to holding their water. They tend to form in the lowest elevations in a given area. So these sorts of lakes may also get underground water that flows in from underneath the lake – the lake floor may be an area of water input, rather than a drain for the lake.",eli5

6m5w23,"Why is it that when you pour liquids out of a smaller opening (like from a jug of milk), then the liquid sputters out instead of flowing evenly and consistently? ","The flowing liquid obstructs the outlet and prevents air from flowing in.  A suction quickly builds up on the inside, preventing further fluid leaving.  For really small openings the flow remains stopped and the container can't empty.  With larger openings air bubbles find a way inside and flow can continue for a short while until there's a need for another air bubble.  This results in the familiar glug-glug-glug cycle as the outward flow of liquid alternates with the inward flow of air.

How big a hole is big enough for the flow to be stopped?  It depends on the viscosity of the liquid.  Pouring less aggressively so that the liquid flow doesn't fully block the outlet can be faster.

Another trick is to swirl the liquid a little as it flows out.  The centrifugal force causes the liquid to flow out around the rim of the outlet, leaving a hole in the middle for air to flow inwards.  The continuous flow of air in and liquid out is faster than with stop-start glugging flows.  Over-doing the swirl slows down the flow, especially at the end so I find it helps to at least slow the rate of swirl once the container is nearly empty.",eli5

4uki7i,Why do tech giants such as Microsoft and Google output the same emoji differently? ,"This is about aesthetics and intellectual property. The standards does not say how an emoji is going to look, just like it does not say how any other letters should look. In one application the designers might settle for one particular look for the emojis that fits with the rest of the design. However someone else might have a different look for their application and use a different design for their emojis. Just like they use different fonts.

It is also the matter that if someone draws a symbol he owns that symbol and have the exclusive rights to give others permission to copy the symbol. It might be that a designer have worked hard on a set of emojis to get them to look as good as possible. Apple likes his work and wants to use the symbols and pays the designer to be allowed to copy them. But to make sure nobody else is using the symbols so they have an advantage they might want to pay him extra for exclusive rights to copy the symbols. Anyone else would have to wait 70 years after the designer dies before they are allowed to copy his work into their products.",eli5
9asr9l,Why are there no mass-shootings in Switzerland,"They do not have lax gun laws. A large amount of the population owns guns, and shooting is a common recreational activity, but they have very strict laws about purchasing, owning, and using firearms. 

To purchase a firearm in Switzerland, you need to be over 18, a citizen or permanent resident, have a clean criminal record, and provide the government with a valid ID, current address, and copy of your criminal history no older than 3 months. 

You need to go through that same process to buy ammunition, and also include proof that you legally own the weapon you are buying ammunition for. You cannot buy ammunition for guns you do not own or don't have a license to own. 

You cannot openly carry your weapon outdoors or in public, even if it's unloaded. Exceptions are made to hunters with a valid hunting and weapon permit, historical reenactments, or shooting competitions. Open carry permits can be obtained, but are normally issued to security and other jobs that would require you to carry a firearm. Such permits require you to have a plausible need to carry the firearm, and pass an exam covering weapon handling and knowledge of gun laws. 

Switzerland doesn't have mass shootings because they have these protections in place. The United States lists ""the right to bear arms"" as a right protected by the Constitution, meaning that similar license and database systems would be unlawful in the US.",eli5

bqqjhw,why do computers use RGB rather than RYB to make all the colors? ,"Because red, yellow, and blue aren't the primary colours of light.

Our eyes detect basically three wavelengths of light: red, green (slightly more on the yellow side of green, but still green), and blue.  All the light that we can see is caused by the three types of cells responding to those three colours of light.  If the light is bright yellow, then both the red and the green detecting cells will react, since it's close enough to their detection that they activate but don't activate as strongly as if it was red light or green light.

Red (actually, magenta), yellow, and blue (actually cyan) are the primary *pigment* colours, because each absorbs a single colour of those three, so that mixing them produces a new colour. For example, magenta light absorbs green light but reflects red and blue light.  Meanwhile, yellow absorbs blue light and reflects red and green light.  If you mix yellow pigment and magenta pigment together, you end up with something that absorbs both blue and green light, which means it only reflects red light, so it appears red.",eli5

When you sweat and it evaporates it is because of two things; the first is that you are heating the sweat on your skin, and the second is that your skin is more humid than the air around it. This creates ideal conditions for heat to enter the sweat, then to leave your skin in the evaporated sweat. The same idea applies here. Heat is entering the water on your hands, and then being removed by the drier. So even though the air is warm the heat in your hands is being pulled out of them giving the sensation of being cold.",eli5

1ye7xl,Why cant endangered/vulnerable animal species like koalas be domesticated to preserve their numbers? ,"Domestication would take generations of breeding, which causes several problems. First, quite a few would have to be taken out of their habitat to find those with traits most suitable for domestic life, which is a problem considering their already small numbers. Second, even if their numbers did grow, domesticated koalas (or other animals) would never be able to live in the wild due to them being naturally reliant on human habitats, so their numbers in the wild would never be helped. That is the main reason we wish to save endangered animals that have been effected by humans, so the habitat doesn't become dangerously unbalanced due to their absence. Also, keep in mind the difference between domesticated animals, like dogs and cats, and tamed animals, like pet monkeys.

The better solution is to use currently captive koalas to breed, and then bring their offspring up in an environment that is close to how they naturally live. However, this has historically been a tough endeavor because we often know relatively little about how and when the offspring of endangered species naturally learn the skills they need to survive in the wild.",eli5

If you're talking about the battery/magnet gif that was on the front page; the energy that causes that motion is being drained out of the battery. Eventually, when the battery is out of juice, the thing will stop moving.",eli5

As such, precautions are taken so that if the worst case scenario happens and something goes wrong during take-off/landing, we minimise the damage. Being upright and locked into place, means the seats are better at absorbing shocks and people can brace for impact. Trays and loose items are stowed so they can't turn into projectiles. Having your seats upright also means that if they do need to evacuate, everybody has enough room to get out of their seat. Evacuations have to happen quick and efficiently, and that can't be done if someone else's reclined seat means you have trouble getting up from yours.",eli5

a62ti2,Why aren't you allowed cellphones and other wave emitting equipment in a mine?,"Cell phones do not work underground due to all the rock shielding the radio signals. So there is no reason to bring it with you. However in a mine there are lots of dangers that can potentially be triggered by cell phones. They often use radio signals to set off explosives. This was in fact one of the first used of radio. However the triggers they use are very simple as they are designed to be disposable and to not have interference. So it is possible that a phone can set off these explosives just like it can interfere with a speaker if you put them too close. And secondly a mine often have explosive atmospheres. They often have lots of explosive dust and can come upon pockets of methane or other explosive gasses. So anything that can make a spark is prohibited. Even a small cell phone will generate thousands of volts in its antenna. So if there is some sort of damage, for example water or soda having corroded away some of the material close to the antenna, then the phone might create a spark which can detonate the atmosphere.",eli5
5f6zk6,Why can't you divide a number by 0? Mathematics,"Algebraic reason for this is that, division is just multiplication. If you're dividing by 2, you're actually multiplying by half.

If you're dividing by 4, you're actually multiplying by a quarter, or 1/4.

If you're dividing by 0, you're actually multiplying by 1/0.

So if you have 0 x 1/0, that should equal 1, because 0 from both sides simplify away. But

    0 * 1/0 = 1           | 0 = 0+0
    (0 + 0) * 1/0 = 1     | distributivity, (a + b) * x = ax + bx
    0 * 1/0 + 0 * 1/0 = 1 | using the identity on the first row
    1 + 1 = 1
    2 = 1

None of the rules we used above sorta allow us to make any exceptions to them. Basic arithmetic just doesn't allow for 0 to be divisor without things breaking down.

How in analysis you may study this is, instead of trying to divide by 0, you divide by small number **close** to 0, but not 0. So if you divide 1 by 0.001, you get 1,000. If you divide 1 by 0.00001, you get 10,000.

Which is why some think 1/0 should be infinity. Unfortunately, -0.0001 is close to 0 as well, and 1/-0.0001 = -10,000. You get negative infinity if you approach 0 from negative side. So it's not like it being infinity or negative infinity works either. 

And from just common sense standpoint, there really isn't that much you can do to make sense of ""divide 1 to 0 people, how much does each person get?"". Obviously you can answer anything you want, and it makes equal amounts of sense since there are no people you're dividing it with.",eli5

5d6880,Why does putting your card into a plastic bag make it work in a card reader. ,"The strip on the back of your credit card is actually a small magnetic field.  When you swipe it in a card machine, it reads these small magnetic fields and registers them as either a zero or a one, otherwise known as binary code.  Binary code is a set of these ones and zeros that can represent a number, letter, or even an instruction for the computer to carry out.  The back of your card will have several of these sets of binary code that ultimately represent your cards unique number.  

When your card gets scratched or otherwise dirty, it can create anomalies when the reader attempts to register the numbers.  When this happens, the card is not processed and you'd have to try again.  Card readers are sensitive so any little thing that could cause the magnetic field to be read incorrectly might cause it to fail.  When you use a bag or scotch tape, it creates a buffer that allows the magnetic strip to still be translated by the reader, but also can mitigate possible anomalies caused by the scratches or dirt because they're not directly rubbing up against the reading head anymore.

There are times when the card itself will be beyond saving, especially if the strip is scratched deeply or just worn out.  Luckily, most if not all card companies will replace your card free of charge.  Card readers themselves can also be finicky, especially if it's older or is dirty and not cleaned.  Try not to keep your card next to anything magnetic and also away from your cell phone as these can demagnetize the strip, depending on the kind of magnetic strip being used.",eli5

1ot9ak,Why can't fish that live in salt water survive in freshwater? ,"Osmosis is a process in cell membranes under which water goes from areas of low solute concentration to high solute concentration.

Organisms generally can't live with lots of salt inside them, so saltwater fish have low levels of salt inside themselves, but are surrounded by water that has high concentrations of salt. So they are constantly losing water through osmosis. As a result, they are built to constantly ""drink in"" more water (and have their kidneys filter out the salt).

Freshwater fish generally have a higher level of salt inside their bodies than in the surrounding water. They are constantly taking in water through osmosis. They are therefore built to constantly ""pee"" out excess water.

Since most saltwater fish are built to deal with osmosis in a way that is *opposite* from the adaptation they need, they cannot survive in fresh water. They do not have the same adaptions to rapidly get rid of water from their bodies, since they are used to water naturally leaving their bodies through osmosis.",eli5

6kbg28,How come we can't always tell which nationality a singer is by just their singing voice? ,"Every singer has influences. There were artists that they admired and wanted to be like, and that influenced their style and performance. And those influences? They had influences too.

So, why can't you call the nationality by the singing voice? Because most English speaking pop stars had influences that were American -- or their influences had American influences, and so on. This goes back to the 1950s, when rock and roll emerged in the southern United States and spread very quickly as a popular music style.

You can see this in a lot of British artists; many say that they ""sound American"" because they affect a rhotic accent when the sing, even though they may have a non-rhotic accent in their speech. You see this all the way back to the British Invasion of the mid 60s -- groups like the Beatles and The Rolling Stones were emulating their influences, which were people like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis and the other pioneers of rock and roll.

That said, not everybody did that. Herman's Hermits, for example, have their accent quite noticeable in their performances. But still these influences have trickled down from artist to artist over the last 60 years.",eli5

But alcohol messes with those protein receptors. It makes it so they are more sensitive, and will alert your brain to heat at a lower temperature then they normally would. This temperature threshold becomes slightly lower then your body temperature.

31eb0c,"Why does one get tired after prolonged exposure to sunlight? Today was a beautiful sunny day, so I went walking on the beach. When I got home I immediately passed out for 2-3 hours (it was still daytime).  I was not tired at all before the walk, and know that it is somewhat of a thing that being in the sun for a while has knack for tiring people out.  Why is this?","adapting to sunlight and heat is metabolically taxing.  Sunlight in particular causes hormone shifts, particularly an upsurge in melanin and melatonin as well as constriction and flooding the body with vit. D.  These directly cause a feeling of tiredness.

Being in the sun causes damage to cells as well, and responding to that damage causes exhaustion (the same is seen following many injuries, and, unsurprisingly, burn victims, where the volume of damaged cells is high.)  I am not clear if the exhaustion is caused by the sudden increase in WBC and hormonal instructions and energy load of cell repair, OR/AND if it is an adaptive response to maximize the effectiveness of those systems.

Finally, the act of staying cool AND active is taxing on the body.  If you are not trying to be active, and it is very hot, your body will decrease function and you could nap/lay still through the heat, but if you are actively trying to work, your body uses active processes (mainly sweating, but also increased heart rate and blood vessel dilation, which require those muscles to be active) Doing this causes a metabic load not only on the krebs cycle, but also on mechanism and the need to balance macro and micro nutrients.  As this adaptation continues, the body continues to weaken because the ability to feed cells (which is, ultimately, based on ratios of exchangeable materials) starts to decrease (the ratios are thrown off.)  In a healthy, well fed person, this can be restored with brief rest.  But, the acute drain can be higher than even a healthy person can adapt to if taken to an extreme (a marathon for instance is very extreme for most people, and not doable at a constant run)  Early signs of failure are dizziness, cramping, and other signs of mental and muscular instability, but this can quickly degenerate into loss of consciousness or seizures, obviously water/electrolyte imbalance is the most common cause, but it isn't the only way.  This is commonly called ""heat stroke.""

Basically, hot, rather than cold, is the most challenging environment for our body's internal processes to adapt to.  Cold requires large caloric intake and artificial methods to retain heat, both of these preserve resources.  But heat requires the body to dump resources, or enter deep states of rest.  note that resting is the adaptive response of people and other warm blooded animals across most desert regions, it just isn't worth the metabolic cost to be active during the hottest part of the day.",eli5

5vbe7i,"Why is rain measured in mm/inches, and not, say mL?","Milliliters are a measure of volume. The volume of rain you capture in a container depends on the area that the container covers, because more area = more water collected = more volume. So a measure of volume wouldn't tell you anything about the actual intensity of the rain because it would vary depending on your container.

When we measure rain with units of distance, we're measuring the height of the water that accumulates in a container over a particular period of time. This height will be the same regardless of the area the container covers, because for any increase in area, you increase both the container's volume and the amount of rain it captures by the same factor. Meaning they cancel out and you're left with a universal measure of rainfall irrespective of your container.

For instance, let's suppose you have a container that covers one square meter of land and captures one liter of rain per hour. If you double its size to cover two square meters, it now captures two liters of rain per hour, since rainfall is distributed roughly equally across land area at small scales. But since this collected water is spread across twice as much area, it still accumulates to the same height within the container.",eli5

So let's say you have a 10 Mbps connection.  You could split it in half, and devote 5 Mbps for uploads and 5 Mbps for downloads.  But most people download a *lot* more than they upload...it would be kind of a waste to be waiting through a big download with that 5 Mbps upload connection unused.

bb3tag,Why does bad vision get better when you squint? ,"Imagine that instead of an eye you just had a flat retina exposed to the world on your face. Light from any direction would be able to fall on a given patch of your retina so it wouldn't be very useful; you couldn't tell that there is a red ball in a specific direction because light from it would be all mixed in with light bouncing off everything else.

A lens solves this problem by focusing the incoming light. In essence what it does is sort it so that only light coming in from a certain angle will exit the lens at that angle as well. Now with the retina behind the lens only the light coming from the ball will hit a given part of the retina and light from other directions won't hit that part. A useful image can be formed.

But there is another way to sort that incoming light. Suppose we put the retina into a box with only one tiny hole through which light could enter. Light tends to travel in a straight line so for any given part of the retina there is only one path to the outside world, straight through the hole. This tiny hole is sorting light much like the lens does, the smaller the hole the better the sorting effect. The cost of course is reduced intensity of the light let through because only that which passes through the hole reaches the retina, while the lens focuses over the area of the lens.

Squinting is narrowing the aperture of your eye and in so doing increasing the focusing effect.",eli5

More broadly, the cough reflex can be activated by any abnormal sensation, including that of capsaicin.

6wa4ad,"Why is Some Pain Experiences as a Throbbing Sensation, While Other Times it is a Constant Feeling? ","Pain is reported in different ways depending on what is going on to cause it.

In medicine pain is broadly split into two categories somatic and visceral.

Somatic pain is the sharp constant pain you would feel if I started poking your arm with a sharp knife. Visceral pain is the throbbing, aching, pain of a stomach ache.

The somatic pain is caused by direct stimulation of a pain reporting cell called a nocioreceptor. It is direct and specific, so the brain interprets the signal directly and specifically.

Inside the body though, most organs themselves don't have those pain receptors. (They wake people up during brain surgery for example to ensure they aren't doing neurological damage and people don't feel that sharp somatic pain in their head while they are in there, because there aren't receptors there for it.) Instead, organs are generally wrapped in a membrane that has pain receptors in it. When something in your body gets injured or is infected it swells and stretches this membrane. This stimulates all the receptors in that membrane and sends a more general signal to the brain which is then interpreted as a general throbbing pain. The throbbing is literally a result of your heart beat, as your blood pressure pulses up and down with each heart beat  blood swells the injured organ further a tiny bit. When the blood pressure drops in between heartbeats there is a little less pressure in the in injured organ and the swelling is relieved a tiny bit. Nocioreceptors are very sensitive, so they feel the tiny pulsation in the organ and report it in a ""throbbing"".   

You can experience the range if you stretch a muscle. At first there is a minor aching pain throughout, but as you force a joint too far the pain becomes more sharp and intense. Eventually it would feel like someone was stabbing you as the pain localized to the area where a muscle started to tear.

There are a lot more complicated subtleties to this as well that have to do with the development of nerve pathways and brain tissue in a fetus. Ultimately the answer to some more specifics about things like referred pain (you have a heart attack and your arm hurts) you find that there is a lot about pain we don't know. There are plenty of theories, but when it comes down to it we can't explain why something like your left arm hurting during a heart attack happens.",eli5

90rik4,"Why do the fifth, seventh, and twelfth frets on a guitar create a pinch harmonic but none of the others do? ","Those are the natural harmonics. 

When the string vibrates the wave is a superposition (things added together) of wavelengths that are twice the string length, 1x the length, 2x, 3x, etc, with amplitudes decaying exponentially (meaning the lowest is the strongest, etc). 

If you picture these waves along the string, the antinodes of those shorter wavelengths (a null, where the string isn't actually moving) are at frets located at 1/2 the string length (12th fret), 1/3rd (7th or 19th), 1/4 (5th or 17th), etc along the string. When you gently press your finger there it mutes out the waves below the harmonic, allowing only those above it to sing. It's essentially frequency dependent muting. 

There are actually multiple locations for those harmonics along the string, because there are multiple antinodes for each harmonic. When you fret a note, those locations shift upward. Pinched harmonics are done by doing the exact same thing as a natural harmonic, except with antinodes closest to your picking hand, and keeping track of how those positions shift towards the bridge as you fret notes. 

It sounds complicated but it's not that difficult with practice.",eli5

3hydqt,"Why are images in billboards in such high definition, despite of its large size? ","Billboards are only printed at 9DPI, which is actually a very, very low DPI (Dots Per Inch), the iPhone 6 for example is 326 PPI (Pixels Per Inch, displays are PPI and printed objects are DPI). For a 30ft wide billboard, you only need around 8MP to achieve 9DPI.  
  
The reason it looks to be in such high quality is that you are very far away. When you are far enough to you can't differentiate pixels/dots, images and text look crystal clear and tack sharp.  
  
Side note- the factor of pixel differentiation is also why if you bought a 4K UHD tv for your living room, you most likely won't be able to see 4K UHD, most people can't even see full 1080p in their set-ups. Though there are other benefits to bring 4K UHD other than resolution.",eli5

Some consumers want to be informed of sourcing so they can make a multitude of different and overlapping purchase decisions.

The sweatshop idea is one example. Perhaps you believe you’ll make a difference or feel better by not purchasing goods made in places you believe have or support sweatshops, or even by not supporting retailers who sell such goods.

Perhaps you believe some places have better material sources or manufacturing practices than others. Maybe there are other social or economic reasons you do or don’t want to support manufacturers in some places. Maybe you’re mindful of import tariffs and taxes and want to support or avoid countries involved that way.

It could be you prefer to shop locally and need a way to identify and avoid imports. Maybe you want to spread money around the world, and want to choose imports over local businesses.",eli5

6f5k3z,Why is it socially acceptable to wear the same pants multiple days in a row but not the same shirt multiple days in a row? ,"Changing shirts is an issue of hygiene. Shirts get dirty faster. Food can fall on them. Bodily fluids. etc, etc get on your nice cotton shirts. If you wear the same shirt for 3 days straight it will start to smell and get gross.

A pair of jeans on the other hand, if you measure bacteria and dirt when you start wearing them, and then measure a month later very little has changed. Sweat itself is effectively odorless to humans, the smell from BO comes from the bacteria eating proteins in your sweat.

You have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction.

You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. 

Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. 

tl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell. Sweat glands in your legs just produce water with salt which doesn't attract bacteria and thus does not smell.",eli5

So, the more patterns the compression algorithm can fine, the more compressed the image can be and the smaller the file will be. 

To take opposing examples. A 100 x 100 pixel image of a red square can be easily saved as ""put red into every square"" while a 100 x 100 pixel image of randomly generated colors without any patterns must have the color of every pixel saved in order to be properly reproduced, which takes up far more space than the simple red square.",eli5

When you are exposed to 20C air, the heat from your body slowly radiates away into the surrounding air, leaving a small layer of warmer air near your skin. Wind blows this away (one reason that you feel cooler when the wind blows. The other reason has to do with evaporative cooling, but that's not relevant here.)

1lrmha,Why does fire give off light? ,"Anything that isn't very cold gives off light. It is one of the properties of matter.

The flames are actually partially burnt stuff. They contain tiny particles of carbon, which, when they cool, become soot. In the flame, they are heated to a high temperature. They are hot enough to glow in yellow and orange light.

Going further, the hot flame of a gas stove glows in the higher energy, blue colors. As things get even hotter, like the hot plasma of an arc welder, much of the light is no longer visible - it has become damaging, very high energy ultra-violet light.",eli5
